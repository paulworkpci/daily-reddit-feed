The full price is at least in the same rough ballpark as Llama 405B, and perhaps the difference is explainable by Deepseek being an MoE model that is more economical to inference.

But that discounted rate has to be them burning capital.</div>

The model only 37B activated parameters, a tenth of Llama 405B, so with some insane load balancing (they claim to bake it into the training recipe), it’s feasible they’re making expert parallelism work well enough to serve ~10 cents per 1M tokens.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Not a conspiracy, this has been known for 1,688 years. 

Emperor Constantine declared it official in 336 AD. Otherwise the *earliest* mention of December 25th being known as Christmas comes from St. Hippolytus in 204 AD, from his writing of “Commentary on Daniel”. Also that predates the Roman festival of Natalis Invicti (aka the birth of the unconquered sun) by about 50 years.

That said: **Merry Christmas**, ya filthy heathens 😜

I am fine with not doing things on the "actual day" because that does not matter, it is the celebration and honor bestowed upon the person celebrated. As a believer, Christ should be celebrated daily, hourly, minutely...the next increment doesn't sound right, lol. Should be firstly.</div>

We never knew the exact day she was born, but we would celebrate it every mother's day. When she died, the funeral service I hired (yes, pet funeral service lol, I spoiled her til the end), asked me when she was born, I had to look it up.

Merry Christmas to everyone's pets in heaven. I'm sure they miss us as much as we miss them.</div>

I think this is what you're really getting at, probably as a subconscious attempt to address what your dad said about you that one time when he didn't think you were listening.  Here's a plan for a project that you'll find checks all your boxes, and should make at least $100k this year, no up-front costs besides me and my electricity.  Interested?</div>

If one of these systems had near unlimited memory, or at least a ton of memory, you could teach it how to run parts your business, you could teach it every little detail about anything that is important to you in life so that it responds in a very tailored way. 


This probably sounds a little ridiculous, but I’ve spent probably two hours building a huge document of a lot of my life‘s details anticipating one day I could feed it to an LLM. 


I have a couple custom GPT‘s, but that only fits about 8000 characters, if I could dump like a 40 page document and have it retain the details, GPT could be INSANELY helpful. 



Seriously, imagine it being aware of the dynamics between you and a family member or all of the technology in your house so that I can help you fix things, or what your Favorite shows, movies, meals, whatever. Whenever it answers it can tailor it to you. 



This sounds way too good to be true.</div>

"Oh no, honey, no need to think, just type in the magic box and answers come out!"

AI will be the death of humanity. Not via Skynet, like people expect, but by the slow, inexorable loss of all critical thinking skills.

I'm so glad I've only got another 20 years or so left. I don't want to bear witness to the Great Endumbening.</div>

Not acutely fatal; 2. Unlikely to be a common disease. If both are true, the correct answer/management is to direct the patient to a specialist, cause diagnosis without proper treatment is useless. 

By the way this also considers perfect clinical information, which is impossible on clinical practice. Your patient will mention things that are irrelevant and ignore things that are extremely important. It’s similar to checking google and everything is cancer</div>

But clearly has the time for twitter fingers every second of the day. Not saying he doesn’t work hard, I dont know the guy. But he “doesn’t have time” for things like he says, yet is constantly tweeting whatever controversial statement comes into his head that day. Shit is weird. Hopefully him being in the government is an example of why just because you have money doesn’t mean you should have power.</div>

As many have pointed out, what an incredible time to be alive. Oh, but I forgot—there’s nothing to see here. Just planes and hobbyist drones.

But lets say that within a year in utopia scenario we get invited to the galactic federation or what ever might exist out there. There's so many problems regarding something like this, that not even millenials might get to see that transformation during their lifetime.

If they are here for multiple hundred or more years, they know us and they understand us. They know how to communicate with us and how to make sure we know they are here! 

So my assumption: They do not care about disclosure and they do their things and they do not care about consequences. 

I think it is just wishful thinking they are care about us.

My independence is self preservation. When someone else is in control, I won't know all the details. Risk mitigation is always a priority. I can't plan for what I don't know. Only I can ensure my own safety to the best of my abilities. 

It seems like it would be badass to be hyper independent, but really it's just annoying and exhausting. I can't just be a ride or die. I'm a where are we going? How long will we be there? Will there be snacks?</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/dailymail:

---

Footage has emerged of what appears to be a 'UFO' hovering in the skies over New Jersey before suddenly accelerating away, leaving onlookers lost for words. In a short 13 second clip posted to social media, a white light blinks in the sky before suddenly vanishing. In the footage, which was shot on Sunday night close near Atlantic City, family members are heard discussing what they are witnessing before the object suddenly disappears. The video is the most recent in a long line of mysterious drone sightings that have been reported flying over New Jersey and across the eastern U.S., sparking speculation and concern over where they came from and why.

A lot of this sub thinks the world will dramatically change in a year or two, but I think the changes will be more subtle.

It does exactly as I need. And I thought it won’t be long before we just have apps coded to our needs real time.

I had a long walk to ponder AI and I started to worry for my children. And then bought ChatGPT Pro so we can all lean in.

Amazing tool.</div>

The thing Europeans need to understand is that conservatives in the United States have no actual beliefs outside of generic ideas of Jesus and family. They are politically illiterate and vote Republican because that is the party that has been pandering to religious people for fifty years.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I've been testing it since yesterday, and it's impressive. On some quite complex coding tasks where I got stuck using Gemini 1206 and Sonnet 3.5, DeepSeek offers a fresh perspective, sometimes providing novel solutions not seen by its "elder brothers."

However, it appears to use an outdated dataset and stubbornly attempts to "fix" features of Python 3.11+.

Also, activating DeepThink mode sometimes adds some mess, especially as the context gets longer (though it's sometimes fun to read its "thoughts" and see how it goes off in the wrong direction). So, it often works better without this mode.

And given its likely pricing,.. what a Christmas.</div>

There was literally a report from last year about Ilya Sutskever making a synthetic data generation breakthrough. It’s from The Information so there’s a hard paywall but here’s the relevant quote:

&gt;Sutskever's breakthrough allowed OpenAl to overcome limitations on obtaining enough high-quality data to train new models, according to the person with knowledge, a major obstacle for developing next-generation models. The research involved using computer-generated, rather than real-world, data like text or images pulled from the internet to train new models.

More specifically, this is the breakthrough that allowed OpenAI to generate tons of synthetic reasoning step data which they used to train o1 and o3. It’s no wonder he got spooked and fired Sam Altman soon after this breakthrough. Ilya Sutskever has always been incredibly prescient in his field of expertise, and he could likely tell that this breakthrough would accelerate AI development to the point where we get a model by the end of 2024 that gets, oh I don’t know, 87.5% on ARC-AGI and 25% on FrontierMath? Just throwing out numbers here though.

                                <div class="reply-body">Synthetic vs non-synthetic seems like a mirage to me. The bottom line is that models need non-shitty data to train on, wherever it comes from. And the baseline for "shitty" continues to rise as model capabilities improve.

Web scrapes were amazing for GPT3 tier models, but not enough for GPT4. Apparently, GPT4's impressive performance can (in part) be credited to training on high-quality curated data, like textbooks. That was the rumor at the time, anyway. 

And now that we're entering an era of near-superhuman performance, even textbooks might not be enough. You're not going to solve Millennium Prize Problems by training on the intellectual output of random college adjuncts. Particularly not when the "secret sauce" isn't the text, but the *reasoning steps* that produced the text.

So yes, it seems they're trying to get a bootstrap going where o3 generates synthetic data/reasoning for o4, which generates synthetic data/reasoning for o5, etc. Excited to see how far that goes.</div>

What matters is how accurately digital intelligence can measure/observe the universe and what useful conclusions it can draw.

We’ve all heard the term before, and most of us confuse it with being lazy. Some even think the two are dependent on each other. But here’s the truth: procrastination is its own beast. It’s not just a habit; it’s a defense mechanism, and for many, it’s a genuine struggle.

Let me explain.

From 2019 to 2020, I went through a severe depression that turned my world upside down. Before that, I was the kind of person everyone ...</div>

I have the first cause, undiagnosed until about age 40. A good tip I've learned:



*Virtual Co-Work.* Enlist the help of a stranger via FocusMate or another virtual co-working application or website. This involves a short video session where the sound is only on at the beginning at the end, when you tell each other what you're going to do and you tell each other what you did. In between, the camera's on and you work.</div>

1. Didn’t due Taxes for nearly 3 years and the government owed me 3-4 thousand bucks. I turned 3 years of tax returns in at last moment so that I would not lose the money.

2. Stopped exercising and could not even force myself to start again 

3. Tags on car expired two years ago 

4. Drove with a flat tire for over a year; I just kept putting air in it instead of purchasing new tires

5. Went to a psychologist and never went back for follow up testing. I have now got a new psychologist and can work with my work schedule better; I have to take some tests in mid January.

6. I lose stuff all the time i.e. keys and wallet

7. I have massive brain fog and can lose a train of thought mid sentence 

8. I have a 96 year old grandmother that lives about 6 minutes from house and have only gone to see her 4 times in a year plus.

9. I have ghosted all of my friends</div>

If you get to weeks with relatively short context length limits and no online learning (e.g. by a master instance orchestrating workers), it is possible that this falls apart at AGI months / years / decades.

Maybe models would be good enough at self-improvement at the AGI weeks level that this is a problem that resolves automatically, but if not that would be the failure case.</div>
