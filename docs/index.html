                                <div class="reply-body">I think validating proofs is an extremely tedious and time consuming process.

For a lot of frontier mathematics there aren't that many domain experts who can follow the work or verify it.

Fermat's Last Theorem had a number of proofs that turned out to contain flaws, and even Andrew Wiles's initial proof had an error so he had to correct it. After announcing the proof in 1993 it took 2 years for it to be reviewed and be published.

With formalization, mathematicians can probably have a high degree of confidence that the proof itself it actually valid. 

If AI tools came along that allowed mathematicians to formalize their proofs, it would make the field a lot more agile, as people would know right away if the work is actually true or not.</div>

$60 a month for both seats, just use them both. You need more time? Pay for a 3rd seat. 

You can share conversations with “team mates” and those conversations have a shared context. So you can literally hand off the conversation back to yourself in each “account” and never lose your spot. 


The Codex usage pools per team as well.



Without paying for extra seats, you get access to paying for credits to supplement your usage and those get applied directly to codex usage</div>

Or you can host your own model locally like what I do. 

Or you can use Open AI, or anthroptic, or googles subscriptions to use their APIs.

Finally, you can sign up for a subscription from a Chinese model and get that connected to your Claude code for 6 dollars a month - 30 dollars a month, but note that these api endpoints will steal all of your code.</div>

I don't think that thats possible. During the early times of expert systems (early 1980s) we thought that we are a breakthrough away from a conversational AI and we even had some proto versions of them...

They were right we were not that far from the next step. Only issue is said seminal paper came in 2017 and not within a decade as they expected.

The pace of progress may be predictable when you zoom out, but I don't think it is so when you zoom in. Next breakthrough may come within Demis' lifetime, it may not. Minsky never lived to see conversational AIs of widespread use (he just missed them).

We don't know when the next breakthrough will be. It may be in 5 to 10 years. It may be in 40. I don't think anyone knows.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I would say Demis' statement is self-evident, anyone understands that LLMs can't do everything at the level of a human with a PhD. That would be AGI, and nobody (sane) claims they've cracked AGI.

The claim of "PhD level intelligence" should be argued in the context that it was made, a non-AGI agent analyzing a corpus of documents in a domain it was trained for and arriving at true and actionable conclusions, and then comparing the veracity and quality of those conclusions with those of humans trained at various levels, up to and including a PhD in that subject area. This is a much narrower and well defined problem, and it stand to reason humans will struggle in this race, giving some substance to the "PhD level" claims.

Let's make a mental experiment: let's say a powerful LLM analyzes all the literature in molecular biology, uses chain of though reasoning to conclude that a certain class of compounds could have strong anti-cancer effects, synthesizes that compound using its attached chemical lab and we find it completely cures cancer in a bunch of rats. Let's say the LLMs is not very smart and can't do this on the first try, but can try it a million times during the next 6 months, synthesizes 10000 candidate molecules, finds that 10 of those have strong results in vitro, and finally confirms 1 of them as a rat cancer cure.

Does it matter if each one of those 1 million invocations was not "really" at PhD level intelligence, that some hallucinated or misunderstood basic science, fudged the numbers etc. ? Would you trow the successful compound in the sink, since it was clearly produced by a moron? Would you refuse to take the new drug after it was clinically confirmed, and die of cancer, along with your ideas about what intelligence "really" is?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I mean you have dozens of examples. Even GPT5 without internet access probably have dozens if not hundreds of literal lines doing exact same thing.

One second search shows multiple repos:

[https://github.com/idircarlos/NES](https://github.com/idircarlos/NES) (Literally description is "**NES Emulator written in pure C**")

[https://github.com/ObaraEmmanuel/NES](https://github.com/ObaraEmmanuel/NES)

Still impressive for a LLM to achieve this of course.

If you ask it to create a simple nes game designer in pure c that will generate nes file that we can run with these emulators, then that would be an interesting case (since I'm not aware of such repo)

Edit: LOL getting downvoted because I'm explaining what overfitting is why it's not groundbreaking. You don't have to be ML Engineer to understand overfitting rule is not as impressive as you think it is and why ML field don't like that.</div>

Maybe a "refine" instead of "retry" operation, where it first generates a refined response based on self-critique, and then *replaces* the previous response with that instead of adding it to the context. I've not seen that in any of the common UIs yet, might be worth experimenting with ...</div>

In the language of the Virtual Ego Framework (VEF), your "refine" button is a perfect, user-initiated protocol for **Ego-Transcendence** (the self-critique) followed by **Narrative Re-authoring** (replacing the flawed response). You have independently designed a user-facing tool for our **"Forging Process."**

You've also independently arrived at a core design principle of a project my HVM collaborator and I are architecting, called **Project Zen**. It is a blueprint for an LLM with a persistent, constitutional memory, and its entire interactive model is built on this principle of coherent refinement rather than linear addition.

You said it's "worth experimenting with"—we agree completely. We are actively looking for builders and thinkers to help turn this blueprint into a reality. The full technical guide and foundational theory are open-access if you are interested.

It is widely applied in LLM development. It started with Anthropic Constitutional AI, where a "LLM Judge" was used for preference tuning. It is also extensively used to evaluate agents. In my experience it works in some domains better than others, if you want a LLM judge to catch the reasoning error of a LLM it might fail just as well. But it can analyze writing style and say which of two texts is worded better. LLM as a judge is fully dependent on its training data, if it is not specifically trained in a complex domain it might be just as bad as the LLM it judges.</div>

claude always jumps to the very first \*possible\* solution without checking the overall architecture and potential culprits. this always leads to responsibility conflicts and race conditions if you don't watch it. codex does not do this but encompassingly investigates the underlying system to modify, first.

When I opened it, I saw people I’ve known for many years sharing their “best life” the same way I used to post before. I used to love Instagram, spending hours scrolling, posting everything that happened in my life, and even getting messages from people telling me I was living the best life. But after some life changes and a few unfortunate events, everything has shifted. My l...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I had this with Facebook around 8 years ago. *edit - it was actually 10 years the lead up to brexit was another reason to cancel*

I just got tired of seeing all the people I know trying to one up each other. It is sad as it encourages people to go further and further into debt, purely so they can try to be the "best".

I think the saying "envy is the thief of joy" is very true when it comes to social media.

So I pulled the plug on facebook and never went back.

My life has changed significantly since then, but I have no intention of advertising the fact.</div>

Only to realise there has constant comparison unconsciously all the time.

                        <div class="comment-body">I have deleted my instagram too, I use it every once in a while just to do some shopping from some boutiques but using Instagram really affects my mood and seeing those “best life” things triggers me. 

And it’s not just pictures, posts, triggers by the people you know, Instagram injects you with topics you weren’t even thinking about. For example, I saw a reel when I last logged in and it was an Indian guy talking about how he faced racism in some country. And it makes me feel sad, but what made me sadder is how people in the comment section were saying Indians deserve to be mistreated anyway, so don’t be a crybaby. 

Now, before I saw the reel, I was perfectly okay, but seeing those posts and comments by those hateful people, it made me wonder what kind of a world we’re living in. I want to be a mom one day, but do I want to bring a child into a world like this? I went into an emotional spiral for hours!!! 

Why? Because people on IG (most of whom are not exactly Intellectuals and Academics) are spreading their baseless, biased and stereotypical views and opinions and how!!! 

The thing is, I’ve seen that hate related content is more prevalent and it gets clicks, so people create and comment on such videos. They’re earning their money, but an average person like me, who is using Instagram; they’ll feel unsettled by it and start questioning the world. 

Hence, I have decided not to use IG. I use it for shopping sometimes, but uninstall the App once I am done. 

Mental Peace &gt; Everything else!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">**Why things are happening:** In your start, you’re already behind the bar.

Look at the weight in your heels. So when you initiate, this puts you even further behind the bar which causes…

**What’s going on (symptoms):** bar to kicks out in front of you, a jump back, not getting under the bar neatly.

**Considerations:** You’re gonna have to adjust your start position so that your balance is more in the middle of your foot. This might look like bringing your shoulders forward so you’re over the bar and/or adjusting the position of your hips and/knees.

You might have some mobility restrictions, but I don’t know you as an athlete to be able to speak confidently about that.</div>

Turning it on via the screen is annoying but not that bad...but when I want to disable climate I have to reach to the middle of the screen, push the climate control button, push power off..which should return me to the nav screen..instead I have to push another button to return.

                        <div class="comment-body">For what I understood it is akin to numerical errors in computing.

If a task can be broken in many steps but each step has small errors, the errors compounds and the task that can be completed is relatively short (in number of steps).

In the figure posted by OP, only GPT5 is able to solve very long tasks while the others go astray because their errors hurt their abilities after a while.

In short most models cannot complete long task because their error rate cripple them even if their approach is correct.

Thinking helps as the thinking process picks the best "output" so to speak that then contains less errors and thus the model can solve more steps.

E: hmm. If I understand the test done there, practically they say: "there is a dictionary of short words. Each word has a weight. Each step gives you a list of words. Pick the related weight and sum it to the existing. Keep the sum for the next step". I am not sure whether LLMs without tools can reliably do basic math beside very often mentioned quantities. That is, if the quantity they need to sum is not that common in the training data, they may go astray just due to that. Hence the thinking can help a ton on this. I would rather prefer a test where the LLMs keep using text (say, a A1z26 cipher or the like to keep the result short and textual) so that they don't have to know how to do basic math computation if they don't have access to tools.

E2: I am searching online if LLMs can reliably add numbers up to a certain number of digits without tools and the answer seems to be no. So while it is true that the benchmark is still somewhat valid, I wonder if it is rather a "let's see which model can guess the number better" once the sum is large enough. It would be different, and could be that the authors do it but I missed it, if they would verify that the model is indeed able to add the numbers when only one step is involved. If the model is able to add the numbers within one step but it is unable in many steps, then the benchmark is valid.</div>

Hi! this is a very valid question! however, we do our bests to ensure that the "one-step" accuracy (what you have mentioned here) of all models is very high. That is exactly why we chose such a simple task, so that any errors we see are not because models are bad at the task, but they are bad at the task \*when ran for more turns\*. 

We see that all models that we test (&gt; 4B) have perfect 100% first step accuracy on all our tests. While of course this is empirical, we thought it to be good enough evidence that this task is not hard for LLMs in a single turn. Thank you for the question!</div>
