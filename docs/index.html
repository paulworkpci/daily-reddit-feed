i workout, have a good diet, study, but that’s pretty much it. it’s hard to enjoy the things i used to do, like going out alone. i get kind of sad seeing a happy friend group. or people with partners. i’ve been doing the work, and still feel like that’s not enough. 

so i just stay at home, and scroll. or listen...</div>

In the old days I would take an exercise class at the JC. People in your class might talk to you, people walking would smile, say hi, and acknowledge your existence. Now if you get out and do something like that, most everyone has their face in a phone, anyway. They don't even notice you walking by them. It really ads to the loneliness and isolation these days. 😞</div>

But something seems off with [r/powerfulJRE](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerfulJRE/). Love or hate Joe, the one thing that still glues us all together is our love for a good old fashioned conspiracy theory. I think I found one that even JRE legend Eddie Bravo would like.

It's definitely a propaganda farm, and a lot of the ideas they push are genuinely frightening.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">alright here’s one that sounds dumb but hits hard

put your shoes on even if you’re working from home even if you’re not leaving the house putting on your shoes tricks your brain into “go mode” it tells your body we’re doing stuff now not lounging not scrolling not chilling

it’s weirdly energizing and creates just enough friction to stop you from crawling back into bed or zoning out on the couch

you start associating shoes with movement and action and it bleeds into other stuff like knocking out errands, standing up more, or actually starting that task you’ve been avoiding

low effort high return and yeah it’s dumb but it works</div>

I used to try to work out "maybe 3 times a week". I would blog "when I had something on my mind". Those never worked, because it created a negotiation every time (is today the day?).

Now I work out every day. Some days it might be a super short lame workout, but it's something. Usually just getting started leads to something better.

Same with blogging. Every day. Some posts are far better than others, but it's about the practice.

No negotiations needed, just do it.</div>

This past weekend, I really nailed it:

* **Friday:** under 1 hour
* **Saturday:** just 30 minutes
* **Sunday:** 45 minutes (mostly using Google Translate while reading a book)

Also, it’s been a few weeks now without Instagram, and honestly? Don’t miss it. I deleted TikTok over hal...</div>

I will glance at the headlines of the very local newspaper to see what the mayor did thats dumb, because that might actually affect me personally. 

Road closure? Festival? New apartments being built? I'm interested in that - what Susy had for breakfast smeared all over facebook never interested me. 

Good on you for finishing books! I've got 5 going because Neurospicy won't let me sit and finish a single one; but I'm half way through all five!  Reading is awesome.</div>

It's giving me all sorts of insight into the contract, and flat out said "Do not sign this version of the contract under any circumstances." And it listed out the various reasons why. 

I'm not an idiot, so I am working with a business lawyer to review it.

But everything that Gemini called out, the lawyer called out. And I was able to state "&lt;section #&gt; is not clear in this regard" because Gemini already pointed that out. For a few different sections.

And this stuff is only going to get smarter. I am wondering at what point I'll personally feel confident not engaging with a human expert.</div>

The problem is NOT the knowledge, the problem is THE TYRANTS IN CHARGE DO NOT LISTEN.

* We Know How To Solve Global Warming: STOP BURNING OIL.
* We Know How To Solve Homelessness: GIVE PEOPLE HOMES.
* We Know How To Solve Drug Addiction: REMOVE THE HARMFUL DRUGS AND GIVE PEOPLE SUPPORT.
* We Know How To Solve Poverty: GIVE PEOPLE MONEY.
* We Know How To Solve Hunger: GIVE PEOPLE FOOD.

If we invent a superintelligent computer and ask it those questions, it will give us the same answers.

But the way society is currently structured, greed and addiction to money prevents any of those problems from being adequately solved.

The ONLY way AI / AGI will improve society is if it can be allowed to take control of society to run it on behalf of the people. But there will be a lot of billionaires and very powerful people who oppose this because - even if they don't lose a single dollar - it will diminish their control over the rest of society.

Science fiction stories about machines going to war usually frame them as an enemy - but there's a rapidly improving possibility that a super AGI machine could decide to go to war against the tyrants who refuse to listen to the will of the people.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think moving the camera is just how it obscures the more CGI-y parts of the images. You do that in traditional media when you want to do things like obscure the cut between two shots or obscure that one of the actors is a stunt double in makeup and not the principal actor in the role.

Once the quality goes beyond a certain point the camera will probably stabilize.</div>

Turns out, I was just doing more of the wrong things.

The real change happened when I stopped doing these 3 things:

1. Checking my phone first thing in the morning
It ruined my focus before the day even began.

                                <div class="reply-body">My job manages fundraising and philanthropic giving programs.

One of our largest regular donors owns a construction company that has a program hiring recently released ex-convicts to help them get back on their feet so they don’t have to fall back in to crime to support themselves. The majority of people in the program are minorities.

He lost several federal contracts because that program is considered “DEI”.

That closes a work program that reduces recidivism rates for former criminals, potentially shuts down a business this guy built from the ground up, and takes money out of charities he had been donating to for years.

All because he was hiring too many black and brown people.</div>

Trump is clearly compromised. He is a Russian asset that needs to be impeached before turning the US into Russia.</div>

Let him cook. Trump is making the European Union finally grow some balls, and he's showing everyone how austerity and bootstrapping was always a bullshit lie told to poor people who were being pickpocketed by the 1%.

But yes, he is 100% a Russian agent. He even has little Timmy Poolovich working for him now.</div>

And their definition of AGI is very interesting for this context. It's an AI that's better than **99%** of humans at any intelligence-related tasks. By 2030. Which pretty much means that their timeline might not be that different from Antropic's or OpenAI - it could be more of a matter of difference in definitions.</div>

I think it's a mix of 2 and 3, they're close and trying to do the right thing. 

Another wild thought: could be marketing, knowing redditors and x users keep checking job boards of ai labs.</div>

The PRODUCT of this process will be hyper advanced RL algorithms that have true cognitive structures and will ace most AGI benchmarks.  Then THOSE algorithms will be used to do what we call "RSI".</div>

Found this on X feed. 

Wikileaks email from Edgar Mitchell's office to Podesta 2014 claims:

-Mitchell is in contact with peaceful NHI

-Tau neutrino central to zero point energy

-NHI want to give zero point energy to humans

                        <div class="comment-body">So what I've learned so far is-

* Edgar Mitchell, former astronaut to walk on the moon, was very into the NHI benevolence and ZPE. Died in 2016- this email was sent in 2014.
* Terri Moneybags here is someone who seemed to be close to and or inspired by Edgar- has a site where the stated mission is-
   * We educate humans about our work with our 100% nonviolent obedient-to-God ETI, Extraterrestrial Intelligence, from the contiguous universe whose mission is to work with our scientists to bring zero point energy here for the purpose of extending life on our fragile Earth.
   * ***We fundraise with billionaires only, for carefully selected 501(c)3s who are transforming society.*** (yeah I don't like that lol)
* Suzanne Mendelssohn (mentioned on the [website](https://www.terrimansfield.com/)) is a co-founder with Terri who apparently "is Earth’s ONLY ETI obedience healer. Because she is a healer, science and medical intuitive and consultant with special experience in science, particularly zero point energy, theology, consciousness, health care, peacemaking, poverty eradication, race relations, justice for women and the environment, we look for 501©3 organizations whose mission is related."

Honestly, I'm not sure what to make of this because it just seems like they were taking a shot and seeing if they could in fact get JP to respond.</div>

Edit: IP is also the secret sauce to the rise to Japan, Korea, Taiwan and now China. British IP is part of the rise of the US as well. </div>

I can understand Jack coming out with this. He's already cashed out and has come off as a bit of a hippie type that fiddles with tech. 

Elon agreeing is a bit of a surprise, but it's quite stupid since he's presumably got a lot to lose from 0 IP protection. He's done/said a lot of stupid things though. I don't take his word seriously at all.

I'm always surpised artists are coming out in support of IP law. Like artists have rarely been able to make a living through art and have not been the most to benefit from market competition at all, but the few that are able to scrounge through it are defending it in spite of IP law meaning more expensive medicine, halting global scientific research as developing countries can't afford access to western research, and even making their own art consumption costlier. But I guess they'll be one of the few artists to beat the market and win right?</div>

If copywrite were to expire with the death of the author, imagine the consequences. Especially for the authors themselves.
