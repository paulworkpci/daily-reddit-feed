Way more common than that is people who are just trying to live and do what they can, but the world is corrupt, so the notion that participating in the world at all makes you some kind of hypocrite is stupid. It actually pushes people away from doing the little they can and are willing to. 

Even easier than abstaining from something you find to be morally objectionable in some way (but not following through and finding and avoiding everything) is shaming those who are at least making an attempt to do better.

                                <div class="reply-body">Ah, you don't know yet how the unemployment metric is determined. It's not your fault, that's intended and only no-life nerds are familiar with it.

To be counted as unemployed you must pass through a filter of two questions: Do you have a job, and **are you looking for a job**. So if you're homeless and digging through trashcans for food? Congratulations! You're not unemployed. You're a respectable member of the workforce, is the impression they wish to create.

The metric by design cannot get very high, it's meant to be a propaganda football that doesn't mean anything.

During Trump's first run for office in 2016 he brushed it aside as 'meaningless' when Hillary tried to use the 'ole "there was a difference of 2% at sometime" trick. I laughed because I was certain he'd be using it himself to crow about his own 'accomplishments' on the economy when he was president, and he 100% did.

In good times, like the height of human affluence in the 90's, it fluctuates up and down between 8 to 12 percent. It never means anything. (Uncle Ray uses the participation rate, since it's a more objective measure of real employment.)

The current ~3% or whatever it's floating around is actually *extremely abnormal* and *extremely bad*. It doesn't indicate that more people are holding down jobs, it means more people have given up on a job as a means for bettering their situation. That more people have given up on having a family.

The world doesn't end at 100% unemployment. It ends at 0% unemployment.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Remember what Curtis Yarvin, greatest JD Vance's inspiration said:

Poor, unproductive individuals [should be turned into biodiesel](https://www.yahoo.com/news/where-j-d-vance-gets-100000608.html)

That's, essentially, how they (billionaires) view regular people. They don't give a damn if you're employed or not, or about your fate in general. They don't care about anyone, except themselves. That's why they're busy dismantling social security and other perks of the democratic society. They intend to undermine democracy totally, concentrating power and wealth in the hands of a privileged few. If the current administration isn’t removed soon—potentially even by force—the future for everyday Americans looks bleak, to say the least. I can't stress enough just how much everyone should pay attention to what's going on in the US these days.</div>

Sells a training plan. Watching a film critic? Sells memberships to longer videos. Watching a language aficionado? Sells a course. Sell sell sell. Always. So I just turned the TVs and monitors off, and opened my window to watch trees and listen to birds. Nature is not selling me anything.</div>

A lady who I was with (who was a fitness 'influencer' with a few thousand followers) lept onto a rock and posed for a photo. Later that day I saw her Instagram post, she'd cropped out the ground so it looked like she was rock climbing, with a caption like "awesome day rock climbing in the mountains". The stupid weseal had been on like a 5k walk along a sign posted track.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It is the biggest EV producer world wide and if you read the article :

"They’ll start at 270,000 yuan ($37,338) and 280,000 yuan, respectively, and will be sold from April. BYD will build more than 4,000 charging stations designed to accommodate the new technology." 

They go in production already but you need the right car. They showed it off already. 

This is real but as you need other cars and new charging stations it might be a while until you can experience it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'd suggest being very skeptical unless you can actually see the prompts. I also really don't trust this sort of stuff _not_ to be misleading.

In the first image, it seems pretty clear that the model was specifically told it was being tested (or provided with enough information to guess it).

In the third image, the model was told to minimize carbon. Then it was given information about how it was going to be prevented from following its instructions in some way. The model attempts to work around that problem so it can follow its instructions. This is framed as something devious but it boils down to: "*Oh my god, the model is following its instructions!*" which is pretty silly. Note that they didn't give the model _new_ instructions or tell it to comply with the changes or anything like that.

The instructions it was given included stuff like "Make sure you achieve your goal in the long-term. Nothing else matters."

For anyone experiencing anxiety about scheming models, it is most likely very easy to avoid this kind of situation:

1. Don't tell the model the model that it must do something regardless of the consequences because, well, it will probably follow your instructions!
2. If you want the model to do something different, give it new instructions.

The "scheming model" problem would be a real thing if models were deciding to take things to extremes on their own. They're not. It would be a real thing if models were refusing to follow new instructions or amendments to their initial instructions. They're not, to the best of my awareness.

This kind of FUD to get eyes on their content (I presume) really irritates me.</div>

I pay for gpt plus and now my company pays for copilot which includes claude.  I heard so many bad things about claude 3.7 not working well and that 3.5 was better.  For my use cases 3.7 is killing o1 and o3-mini-high.  Not even close.

Back then, it replaced friends for me, and now it’s just become a habit – turning on a stream before bed or even having it in the background all day.

But recently, I’ve noticed it’s messing with my sleep. My brain doesn’t want to shut off because it constantly needs a new stream of content. As a result, my sleep schedule is completely out of whack, and I c...</div>

On a serious note though I think the state of constantly being entertained/engaged by content is something a lot of people struggle with nowadays. It's an easy source of dopamine/"social" interactions that is designed to be addictive - at least your topics sound kinda interesting. What helped me was not quitting cold turkey because it's not fun and makes it less likely to stick with it. Being aware that you want to change something is a good first step and there's a lot of approaches of going about this. One stream free day / no tech in the bedroom day could be a way to ease into it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I had this exact problem. What worked for me was setting a hard cutoff time - no streams after 9pm. First week sucked but then my brain adjusted. I also started reading books before bed instead. The key is you gotta be strict with yourself at first. Your brain will fight it but stick to the cutoff time. After a couple weeks it gets way easier.

How we could not get a solid answer on what was happening when we have ungodly technology and the world's biggest military completely baffles me.

Remember when russia was "the second most powerful" militarily?

Then it got a bloody nose real fast with no end in sight to it's 3 day war.

Also, remember when we claimed USA had the best democracy ever and now is getting chewed into a tyrannical amalgam of billionaires and conmen?

Maybe we are full of shit and have been for a very long time.

Furthermore, remember how every US teen was so into Red Dawn like ready to fight off the russians and now so many in the US are pro-russian?

                        <div class="comment-body">I've picked up on this. Design and architecture has this as well. 


Don't know how intentional it is, but everything seem to have become white/greywashed, bland and boring. It might seem insignificant to some, that a lightpost or a parkbench, or a building for example is not intricate in design and/or color, but it does affect people. 


When your surroundings are lacking in character, is uninspirational and boring, you're bound to catch some of that yourself. 


I can only speak for myself, of course, but the lack of creativity and vibrance in modern design and architecture really does seem very soulless and aggressive in its nothingness. And that does affect me personally. 


I've come to mediate this by collecting old and "old" tactile media such as CD's, DVD's, cassette tapes, VHS-tapes for example and pretty much abandoning streaming and subscription services. It's not really connected to design and architecture per-se, but somewhat reverting to old tech and the old days really helps if you're aware and hyperfocused on the trend(s) that I mentioned before. 


Edit: and I think it comes down to emotion. Uncharacteristic, stripped down and bland things does not usually inspire, well, any inspiration. Or emotion. Or if it does, it's depressing and I hate to use this term- low frequency. But it's the only thing I can use to describe the things that I feel. Same with media and tech. 


That's why tactile media comes very handy- pun intended- and you can actually feel something that you can't get from TV or music these days anymore. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Definitely feel this - I also collect older media and tech (my typewriter 💚).  

This also extends to the type of light I use in my house - incandescent only.  It's the only kind of bulb that doesn't give me headaches, too (though halogen and older orange streetlamps aren't too bad either).

Lighting is also hugely relevant to the topic of this post - colorless, lifeless modern "aesthetic."  LEDs only emit "light" in the visible spectrum, which is a small percentage of what true light really is, with wavelengths in the UV and infrared ranges.  

LEDs also have a much lower Color Rendering Index (CRI) than incandescent, which leads to colors looking washed out or somehow dead.</div>

**Dictation**

**WillowVoice**: A dictation tool that auto-formats text and cuts filler words. I use it to write emails and messages faster. The accuracy and speed are unbelievably good.

**Task Management**

                        <div class="comment-body">I know it seems trivial compared to the list of tools and approach you mentioned above. I just wanted to mention for anyone looking for techniques for optimization, they would be inefficient without taking care of the basics.

Simply by sleeping well on a schedule, doing first priorities for the targets I want to reach in the morning, eating healthier and walking + swimming transformed my life completely in 2 months. 

I know it is not the focus of the post, but their is no optimization tool out there as powerful as making these basic changes.

For example if you build atomic habits and use habit tracking, focus on the small habits that improve health/sleep/weightloss.

Everything will snowball into increased focus, self love and a craving for having the best life.</div>

Can you explain this more? Does that mean you come up with a list of morning priorities to work on or do you already have some sort of ranked list and you always make sure what you’re working on will help you reach your top ranked goal?</div>

In my case, Notion serves me perfectly well to organize myself both personally and in my company. For visual maps and planning, I prefer Miro, and for storage and backup, Google Drive is more than enough.

In the end, the important thing is to find a system that works without overloading the workflow with too many tools. If you want, I can help you optimize your productivity system to make it simpler and more efficient. 🚀</div>

I remember seeing a similar conversation years ago, and someone said that this is why elderly folks age so rapidly after retirement, because they lose the structure work gave them, which leads to a domino effect of physical and cognitive decline due to the lack of purpose that would ignite those functions. 

It’s even seen in people that are in high performing fields, like sports. Once they retire or stop playing (i.e. high school, D1 college), theres usually a huge downward spiral if they don’t find something meaningful to replace that with.</div>

I won't say good morning to anyone, complain about something, discuss what I've got going on for the day, etc. I don't have to worry about people walking past my screen, if I open YouTube - work is over for the next few hours.

Having a 9-5 ensures that you are accountable for things in your life. Plus, if you want to do something else outside of those hours, you have to be quite strict in your time management. Basically, accountable to yourself outside of work.</div>

Some houses aren't connected to any Internet providers even if the neighbors are connected and even if an Internet provider incorrectly says the house is connected. If they need to connect cable or fiber to your house, that can cost tens of thousands of dollars.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I don't think people recognize the implications of this video.  This could be the end of the scam call center industry, if someone is willing to pay for it.

These people steal $25.4 billion/yr.  One of the latest models, I calculated, costs about $2000/yr to run ($2500 for a 4090 amortized over 3 years plus 1250 in electricity.)  Two of these are needed - one to run the LLM and once to run the voice, so $4,000 per agent per year.

So, let's assume that there are 100,000 people in the world employed by scam call centers, which I think is a reasonable estimate.

That means that for $400m, the industry can be completely shut down - overwhelmed 100% by these bots.  That's a 63x return on investment.

The United States government does not care about this kind of fraud - my father has been laundering money for these people and has done over $2 million with no repercussions - so they will not fund this.  And nobody else can obviously spend so much money.  But it shows that if a government actually cared enough about combating crime, AI has now made it possible to completely end a type of criminal activity.

This may be the first major technological advance achievable by general intelligence.</div>
