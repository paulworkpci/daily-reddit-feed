MCP becomes #1. Every LLM embraces it, dxt to install them fast is the norm and they all have marketplaces to add and remove MCP servers easily.

Claude Code takes over unless OpenAI's livestream today unleashes a well-priced model that can out perform Opus in coding. If OpenAI manages to push ahead, Codex takes the lead. 

Regardless of which is popular, all the CLI LLMs get connected by developers so that Claude Code calls Gemini for big contexts or ChatGPT for a second opinion, erasing boundaries between different environments a lot.

More of the UX and testing gets automated as MCP takes over everything. Full OS control via MCP becomes popular and Claude Code builds and debugs itself fully.

More developed planning modes appear where the developer has more control over the to-do list and architecture.

A protocol for talking between LLM agents via md file emerges. This leads to a boom of multi-agent coding. Projects start to have dozens of agents working simultaneously on a project all at once, not just different branches.</div>

Cons: Their models aren't as good at tool use, following directions, not getting stuck as Anthropic's. Their offerings are confusing both at the Plan / API level and the tool level.

They could be the winner long term. IDK.</div>

Anthropic has heavily hinted that they are targeting developers first and foremost, and Google and OpenAI are both going for the more general consumer market.

Kiro just came out and is currently working entirely around Claude, too.

Imo, the secret sauce that Claude has is almost certainly based around their "constitutional AI" approach. 

I've said it elsewhere. What's the one thing we  KNOW distinguishes Claude? It's all the safety oriented guard rails that they constantly harp about. 


Don't get me wrong. Im not for increased censorship in this space, I just think that these guard rails are almost certainly how Anthropic is able to keep a very high agentic functionality level with Claude.

It is able to create "rails" that Claude is able to stay within much more accurately than other LLMs because of it. 

So it's a byproduct of the increased safety guards that they probably didn't even think about originally.


Amazon has stated their intent to invest additional billions more into anthropic and are almost certainly cutting Anthropic a sweet deal on compute capacity for model usage and such.

Reports are out that Neptune v3 has also already been red-teamed by Anthropic. So a new model drop it likely happening anytime now.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Nah. I’m about as left as we come - hippie collective in denmark, the whole nine yards. 

But the thing is… Shane is not left wing. If you listen to his podcast he swings back and forth, but obviously swings way more conservative and jokes about always coming back to Trumps side on issues. 

It is exactly *because* he is on this side of the fence that it is cool that he makes these jokes. (They were written for him, but he still chose of course) 

As a whole world, we need to get back to being okay with someone disagreeing with us politically. 

At least he tries to have those talks with “his buddies”. Him arguing about this with Chris O’Connor (the only openly left/liberal in their crew) is a mainstay in their podcast.

I obviously disagree vehemently with where Shane lands politically but it would be pathetic and narcissistic if i I couldn’t see why. I grew with literal anarchist hippie parents in scandinavia, and he grew up with a Fox News watching dad concerned with borders and taxes.</div>

                <div class="post-content">This will definitely enrage people who practice this kind of meditation, but it can save lives:

If you notice recurring thoughts like *"I don't matter to anyone"*, *"I'm worthless"*, feelings of despair and helplessness, DON'T just observe it and move on.

When your child is hurting, do you also observe their pain and do nothing? Have no opinion? No good or bad? *Of course not*. You actively reassure them and prove them that they are loved and safe.

The same way, don't just accept these though...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, maybe. But at the same time, it could be the only place where you can start the work in the first place. So if you are always absorbed by your mind negative thoughts, and positive affirmations helps to reduce that noise, I see that as a great help in the path. Only once the mind is calm and you reduced the noise, you can reach deeper meditation state. It greatly depends on how many wounds your inner child(s) have and how much time you need to heal.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I've always been a fan of Claude’s Sonnet and Opus models - they're undeniably top-tier. But honestly, GPT-4.1 has been surprisingly solid.

The real difference, I think, comes down to prompting. With Sonnet and Opus, you can get away with being vague and still get great results. They’re more forgiving. But with 4.1, you’ve got to be laser-precise with your instructions - if you are, it usually delivers exactly what you need.

As a dev, I feel like a lot of people are sleeping on 4.1, especially...</div>

If you are using Cline, Roo, Cursor, etc., then 4.1 is one of the few models that can reliably do diff editing without constant screw ups. If price were not a concern, my top 10 list (in order) for ***agent*** coding models:

1. Claude 4 Opus
2. Gemini 2.5 Pro
3. Claude 4 Sonnet
4. GPT - 4.1
5. Kimi K2
6. DeepSeek V3 0324
7. DeepSeek R1 0528
8. Gemini 2.5 Flash
9. OpenAi: o3
10. Grok 4

Honorable mention goes to Devstral Medium. It's great at doing agent coding tasks but has less knowledge.</div>

Then I accidentally discovered something that changed everything. One night I was so frustrated that I started telling myself the most boring story I could think of. Like describing someone doing laundry step by step.

Edit: looked it up.

The available research indicates that aphantasia is uncommon overall. Experts estimate between 2% and 4% of people have it. However, research on this condition — including how many people have it — is limited.

It’s also difficult to determine who has it because many people with aphantasia don’t realize they think in a way that’s different from most people. People with aphantasia may not realize that most people can “see” images they generate in their minds. Some with aphantasia say they thought using the word “see” in that context was a metaphor. Because of this, aphantasia may be more common than research currently shows.</div>

Coheed and Cambria (x2 points, though I'm not tracking points)

s waiver that lets them do direct-to-consumer in NY bypassing dealership franchises. Not like the law backing that was particularly old either, the ban on dtc only came in 2014 (heavily lobbied by dealerships, to no surprise). 

Regardless of how you feel about tesla pushing direct-to-consumer sales for cars is the single greatest thing they've done and its incredibly stupid dealerships are as protected as they are in this day and age. I can hope as much as I want but I have a feeling absolutely nothing is changing anytime soon.</div>

Calling non-agenic models with no proven track record in real world unsupervised task completion "AGI" is absurd, much less calling them ASI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Rogan may have succeeded in life financially but he has truly become one pathetic specimen. He's a fucking walking contradiction, claims to have an open mind but also has a bullshit meter and detection the likes of which us mere mortals couldn't even begin to comprehend. Despite these claims he's continually fallen for bullshit right in front of our eyes on his podcast, imagine how much slop and nonsense his personal algorithms feed him everyday  which he probably doesn't give a second thought to. Due to his level of success he has access to some of the greatest minds the scientific community has to offer. With that in mind, who does Joe share his massive platform with and elevate their voices? Fucking Ian Carroll, Eric Weinstein, Terrance Howard, Gad Saad or whatever the fuck his name is. Then let's step outside the science discussions and see who he pushes. The entire Trump administration, billionaire ghouls like Peter Thiel, Zuckerberg, Andreesen, Elon Musk. It's become a cliché statement by this point but covid was a crossroads in Joe's life, it broke him and what were once some questionable aspects of his character became fully embraced. He's now one of them, his net worth, political leanings, and move to Texas has made him a member of the good ol' boys club and in my opinion he's now firmly a net negative for our society.  I hate every last thing he stands for now, he's constantly droning on about echo chambers and rhetoric but has become a large piece of state media.</div>

It must be a terribly sad way to live, constantly fearful of mankind’s greatest accomplishments. Easier &amp; more comfortable to willfully lower yourself to the level where you believe that stand up comedy and talking into a microphone thrice weekly is the pinnacle of human creativity and ingenuity.

More, he literally sits in the oval office with his billionaire buddies and they do market manipulation that wins them 500+ mln USD and they boast about it to the camera.

Dude could be doing something like Clooney and living the life on Lake Como or somewhere beautiful. Instead, he has a mansion on a brown lake in Austin and talks about covid to nutters, lifts kettlebells, kicks a heavy bag and does sets to podcast fans that will laugh at anything he says. Nothing wrong with that if it makes you happy but he doesn't seem that happy to me.</div>

Like, who cares if it gets a slightly higher or lower number on some test, when it's an AI system that can actually do work and create a real-world artifact.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Some people think human creativity is "siu generis" , original/unique/without precedent. It's such a common pretence it's accepted as objective fact, but anyone familiar with "unique" creative artists or musicians will know that they have "influences".  The Beatles singing "woooo" and shaking their heads was lifted from Little Richard, other stuff from Chuck Berry.  

Picasso pretty much lifted his early style (which became cubism) from African art after he visited a large Afro-art exhibit at the Trocadero.  All creatives in traditional education are "trained" on the techniques of prior artists, learning to emulate and replicate by memorising and subsuming their techniques.   Each generation built on the last.    

For larger creative leaps we combine dissimilar art.  German electronic music looped by black urban funk DJs might get you early Hip Hop.

                                <div class="reply-body">There is no difference between “hallucinations” and “not hallucinations”. Even calling it hallucinations is to anthropomorphize and confuse concepts.

The output of an llm has no intention or meaning. It is only when you read it that you yourself assign it meaning. And when it doesn’t make sense to you, you call it an hallucination.

In other words, the output of the llm has a range of quality, and the lower range is garbage, but there is no way to distinguish between that and good quality output.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That's not strictly true, it's more like "this entirely unexpected move doesn't look like it would work, but apparently there's a 30 move sequence that gains you a pawn that no human could ever hope to calculate."

So it's not really the creativity that's the giveaway, it's the fact that the "creative" move is actually good, as opposed to a desperate blunder. 

I'd be interested to find out if it's the same in Go, though.</div>

All I know is ChatGPT and Gemini would never release an anime girl AI that shakes her ass in lingerie. Not really sure why Elon added it to Grok but he did. Now making sex androids is a whole different story but assuming it becomes possible, it’s either between Tesla or some Chinese company as it currently stands</div>
