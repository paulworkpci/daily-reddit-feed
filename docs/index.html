                                <div class="reply-body">😂 Yeah, I get the basics. What throws me is that it’s not a hard cutoff or obvious truncation. It feels more like earlier assumptions quietly losing weight over time, especially after refactors.

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, this matches my experience pretty closely. Rewinding + regenerating works, but I kept finding I was still relying on my own memory of why decisions were made, not just what they were.

What helped me was treating long chats more like checkpoints. I’ll periodically snapshot the state (decisions, constraints, “don’t touch” rules) and then carry that forward explicitly.

I’ve been doing that with thredly alongside NotebookLM, which makes it easier to keep the context stable without constantly restarting or trusting the model to remember everything implicitly.

Have you found any way to reduce the overhead of those rewinds, or is that just the trade-off with longer sessions?</div>

LLMs can have very strongly biased associations within their training data.  The problem is that you might tell a language model to do A, but in its' dataset, A is considered unavoidably associated with B, C, and D, even though you might not actually want those other 3 things at all, and had no idea it was giving them to you.

As a concrete example, if I'm vibe coding an application, and tell ChatGPT I want it to write a mechanism for parsing configuration files, it will most likely go ahead and write something that uses JSON.  So if I actually want to use PostgreSQL to store configuration data, then I can't tell it, "write me a configuration parser."  I instead have to tell it, "write a PostgreSQL function that opens a connection and either reads or writes X, Y, and Z pieces of data."

If you ask it for applications, you will get a template for a specific application.  If you ask it, "write me a specific database function," as mentioned, then it will make minimal assumptions, meaning that you are much more likely to get what you actually asked for.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That’s a good explanation, and it lines up with what I’m seeing in practice. A lot of the drift feels less like “forgetting” and more like the model falling back to its strongest associations once the original framing weakens.

Being extremely specific definitely helps in the moment. The problem I’ve hit is that across longer sessions, even well-specified constraints tend to lose weight relative to those defaults, especially once you move from greenfield to iterative changes.

That’s why I’ve started treating decisions and constraints almost like an interface contract: something explicit that gets carried forward or re-applied, rather than relying on the model to keep inferring intent from accumulated context. It’s reduced the number of times I end up fighting implicit assumptions instead of making progress.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The Epstein emails along with these condoms paint a clear picture that Epstein absolutely despised Trump after their falling out. To a point where he was obsessed with him. The emails mentioning trump all mock him or revolve around a plan to bring him down or black mail him. These condoms are another example. He had an obsessive hate for Trump. My assumption is that it stems from jealousy that a former good friend broke ties with him, ratted on him to investigators, Epstein was then charged in 2006, Epstein has to then work more in the shadows as he has a bad reputation, meanwhile his old pal don becomes president. Anyone thinking that Epstein liked Trump from these emails or having condoms like this is allowing their bias of trump to mask the obvious truth that Epstein really really despised Trump</div>

No extra floor rugs ( break this rule IMHO), couches have visual space so the eye goes under and imagines the rest.

I had an experience after yoga today that I wanted to share and get some thoughts on. During savasana, I felt this clear sensation like someone was holding my hand. It wasn’t scary. It felt warm, grounding, and really comforting, like a gentle presence was there with me.

For context, I’ve been doing EMDR therapy and working with a spiritual therapist for about a year now, so moments like this aren’t totally out of the blue for me, but this one felt especially real.
