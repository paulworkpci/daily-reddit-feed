                <div class="post-content">Honestly, I think I could probably rant pretty hard here, so I'm going to try to keep this simple and just sort of bullet pointish, but these are the things I've realized after a week. For context, I'm someone who routinely had 15+ hours a day of my phone's screen being open doing something. A great chunk of that was it shoveling out media in the form of youtube, even getting me to sleep and playing after I was asleep. But we are talking me being on my phone engauging with some form of media fro...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Ah, I do let myself use a computer, but because it's just like.. less convenient, it means I am doing some action that makes me do at least *something*. In practice, just getting out of bed and starting to do other things has made me not "cheat" by getting on a computer.. From the beginning, my goal in this was to force myself out of my bed and onto other things. So that is, for instance, how I'm on reddit right now... but I only ended up on here because I got a work call and had to get on. Before that I was reading a book on my kindle in a book store for the first time in something like 6 months.

This might sound strange as someone who has spend so many hours on a phone, but I honestly don't think I was addicted to my phone. It was more a tool I could use to be completely escapist and not have to but up agianst my depression. I think about how people mention "enablers" in addicts lives. Eg: the Parent that keeps feeding and giving money to their addict son. To me, my smart phone was like that and the thing that it was enabling me to do was not fight my depression. So for me, even having to do something on a computer feels like a win. \^\^;

As for how long I might switch to a dumb phone.. I'm actually still trying to figure that one out. As for right now, I've decided that I will do this for at least a month. That was sort of the original plan.. but the farther into this thing I go the more I think I will just not go back to smart phones at all. I'm not sure that I have enough will power to not fall back into a life where I just lay around all the time to avoid pain.. and because I am over IT at my company, I might have the luxury of being able to use hardware tokens for MFA. I think if I do end up with a smart phone again, I'll have to use a rooted phone that I've set up specifically so that I cannot bypass any security settings. I think I need to at least have a limit on how long I can use specific apps that I can't bypass.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly, I wouldn't have gone full dumb phone if I hadn't just managed to bypass the popular blocking apps in my past efforts to do without a smart phone. For most people I think just using an app is going to be easier, more flexible, and just more compatible with today. \^\^; That said though, if you do end up wanting to go with a dumb phone, I'd just ask if you've checked with the institutions you are worried about to see if there are other options for verifications.. Because a lot of people (ie: grandparents) don't traditionally use technology much, a lot of institutions allow you to get through with other things like hardware tokens. (RSA tokens, Fido2, U2F, etc..). You might find that institutions you are worried about allow you to use these option or that you can use a competing institution that does offer this option.</div>

With 3.6 million members, I expected a more informed discussion, not a collective 'aha' moment over something that seems like it should have been obvious.

                                <div class="reply-body">So easy for old methods. It can easily be fixed with augmented training data and is rather trivial if done that way.

Pokemon was great exactly because Antrophic probably did not supply any fine tuning for it - those are then real generalizing capabilities.

If it actually turned into a benchmark, you'd see some corporate labs jump on reporting great strides in scores, but it can be achieved in ways that are rather shallow and just for show.

So if they can make clear that they are not fine tuning for pokemon or path finding, that is exciting. Or, a benchmark probably need a more varied set of such challenges.</div>

The one on the left is not earlier than 2009, and the one on the right is no later than 2024. So, 15 years at most, probably significantly less. 

Botox is playing a role, and his hair plugs have finally failed. 

Lastly, the Parkinson’s disease also affects the way he is able to move his facial muscles. 

So, there’s a lot going on there, but I have zero doubt that those images are of the same person.</div>

I'm sure its not beating any benchmarks, or meeting any common definition of AGI, but this is the first time I've had a real genuine conversation with something I felt was real.

                        <div class="comment-body">There are 2 vacant Congress seats in Florida. Republicans have 218 seats. Democrats have 215. If we can gain those two seats, we can keep the House gridlocked. Republicans could only risk losing one or two votes. That's easy to overcome.

The seats were filled by Matt Gaetz and Trump's current NSA. 

The elections are a month from today!</div>

There are 12 GOP held seats in the House, three in the Senate, that are in swing districts/states. We need to get momentum behind recalls.

This post is about 3FS (Fire-Flyer File System), a super-fast file system designed for handling huge amounts of data efficiently, especially for AI and machine learning tasks.

ELI5 (Explain Like I’m 5) Version:

Imagine you have a giant library with millions of books. Normally, if you need to find a book, it takes a long time because you have to search for it one by one.

Now, imagine if hundreds of librarians could search at the same time and find books instantly. This is what 3FS does for computers—it supercharges the way data is stored and accessed so that AI and other applications can work way faster.

Key Points: •	🚀 3FS is like a “turbo speed” storage system for AI. •	⚡ It can read data at extremely fast speeds, allowing AI to process information quicker. •	🧬 It uses a special design that makes data sharing more efficient. •	✅ It helps in training AI, saving progress, and searching for data quickly. •	🌊 It works with another tool called Smallpond to manage data smoothly.

Think of it as a super-fast digital brain that helps AI learn and work more efficiently!</div>

Edit: I had to share this Chatgpt prompt:


"Dude, have you actually looked into X-COM? Like, have you really dug into what these guys are doing? It’s insane! They’re literally a bunch of rogue, unaccountable psychopaths running around, abducting people, brainwashing soldiers, and waging this guerrilla war that, honestly, most people don’t even want!

Look, I get it. The whole 'aliens took over, and now we have to resist' thing sounds romantic, like some 1984-style, fight-the-system kinda deal. But have you actually been to an Advent city? They’ve got clean streets, no crime, healthcare that actually works—like, dude, they have genetic upgrades for regular people! And these X-COM dudes? They’re out there blowing up infrastructure, raiding medical facilities, killing Advent officers—who, by the way, are just trying to keep the peace!

And let’s talk about the aliens, man. I know, I know, 'Oh, they’re overlords, they’re manipulating humanity.' But what were we doing before they showed up? We were destroying ourselves! War, pollution, disease, all of it. The Elders come in, and suddenly, boom! Humanity gets a chance to actually evolve. These guys have been around for who knows how long, they’ve mastered genetics, they’ve got tech we can’t even comprehend, and X-COM’s response? 'Nah, let’s blow up a gene clinic because we don’t like the idea of progress.'

Dude, these guys are just terrorists with a nostalgia problem. They want to drag us back to the dark ages because they can’t accept that maybe—just maybe—the aliens are better at running things than we ever were. You don’t have to like everything the Elders do, but you gotta admit, Advent has done more for humanity than any Earth government ever did.

And don’t even get me started on the psionics, man. Like, have you seen what these guys can do? There’s some next-level consciousness-expansion stuff happening, and X-COM wants to shut it all down. I bet if they just sat down with one of the Elders and did some DMT, they’d realize we’re all part of some cosmic intelligence, and they’d stop acting like paranoid lunatics.

I’m telling you, X-COM is fighting the wrong war. They’re clinging to this outdated idea of 'humanity first' when, in reality, the future is hybrid, man. The future is evolution. And if you can’t see that, you’re just stuck in the past."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">i think 4.5 was essentially an experimental run designed to push the limits of model size given OpenAI's available compute and to test whether pretraining remains effective despite not being economically viable for consumer use. i wouldn't be surprised if OpenAI continues along this path, developing even larger models through both pretraining and posttraining in pursuit of inventive or proto-AGI models, even if only a select few, primarily OpenAI researchers, can access them.</div>

If it were a suicide pact, wouldn't they have left a note?  Even if it was murder-suicide, you'd think that would be pretty easy to figure out.

Their deaths are weird for sure.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My first thought was either suicide pact OR one or the other found the other, was devastated, and ended their life (or in the case of Gene, simply became emotionally overwhelmed and effectively died of a broken heart (cardiac event) at his fragile 95 years of age, no suicide intended or attempted). The problem with both theories is that usually when someone is so bereaved that they want to join the other, they at least end their life in the same room as the other, often holding, hugging, or lying down or at least sitting next to them…..it’s all about being with them again. That didn’t happen here. 

Also the one dog in a cage is inexplicable, true dog lovers (as they’re both described) would never allow an extraordinarily horrible death of a pet alone, starving, overheated, scared, confused, tormented and whatever else inside of a cage….that’s just horrible….as the other two dogs were left free and roaming so yeah, it’s difficult to imagine what exactly happened. The puzzles here just aren’t fitting.</div>

I just saw this post on twitter from earlier tonight! The president is in Florida right now and some of the military aircraft flying in the area are experiencing “Orbs” flying around them and messing with their electronics in the aircraft! The guy who posted this on twitter said “This is a first for me in 40 years of monitoring”. Something strange is definitely going on tonight!! …………………………………………………………………………….

“That flair for hype is on full display at Sutskever’s new venture”

The author doesn’t seem to consider that Sutskever may be completely honest in his beliefs. To the author, this is just another money grab.</div>

His mission is different. He wants to focus on the safety part of AGI/ASI. He is not interested in selling a product. There are investors who believe in this vision and want to be part of it. That’s basically it.

The ridiculing tone of the author is unnecessary considering that this guy is one of the pioneers of modern AI</div>

I'd like to remind the "[UAP Caucus](https://www.uapcaucus.com/congress)", who are increasingly failing to properly prioritize the issue their Caucus was created for, some wise words that one of their own members Tim Burchett [once said](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/18b1mxn/burchett_the_ufo_communityis_watching_everything/):
