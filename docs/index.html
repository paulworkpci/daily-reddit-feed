They have started using her to promote the ATK app in recent videos, and the combination of any perceived advertisement always sucking with a person who is not a salesperson/influencer (and probably also reluctantly voluntold) doing it several times per video makes it feel that much more jarring that a reliable source is now kinda pedaling subscriptions or even (eventual) paywalls</div>

He clearly doesn't have a good grasp on mankind and what drives humans, he is very obviously on the spectrum and extremely smart but he lucked out to get where he did. He is not a visionary or a big picture thinker.

His companies will eventually become obsolete as he will very obviously fail to predict the next shift in human social connection and we will finally be able to live our lives without fear of having to accidentally hear an opinion or prediction coming from this man's mouth ever again.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Import/export of settings is great! Which reminds me - where can we find the settings file? Is it something I could commit to a repo then clone onto multiple computers, ensuring I have the same settings on all my computers?

And is there anything on the roadmap for allowing adjusting system prompts per mode? I have some custom modes that don't need a lot of the info in the system prompts and I'd like to trim it for those specific modes, but not for all my modes.

Nice work on this update, I'm really loving Roo. It's been such a game changer for me.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">i've seen these "written by AI" numbers as explained in a few different ways, assuming "written by AI" means code that is merged to production codebases:

1. there's a percent that's basically just autocomplete
2. there's a percent that is a chat answer, prompted by a human, after which the AI solution is accepted without further edits
3. there's a percent that is autonomous code review, where there are changes made to code that is generated by a human and/or numbers 1-2 above. this, in my experience, is the best value add that AI currently has to offer, if we're considering rate of success, cost, and time saving.
4. there's a percent that's an entire AI system that's identifying a problem, suggesting a solution, coding the solution, and then eventually being accepted without edits. this is the agentic stuff people talk about

they're all obviously different levels of complexity / autonomy / singularity-ness. i'd be curious to know what the breakdown is for the CEO's statement here, but i'd imagine that the percent of code that satisfies my #4 is very very small</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Ran o3 three times, giving small hints on the first two attempts - still failed even after hints.

On the third attempt with no hints it was counting for 4 minutes 39 seconds and got it right.

I guess what happened is that it remembered the hints from the first two attempts (like consider how many cubes are in the longest run, focus on strict counting instead of estimates), took its experience failing into account, and put it all together. 

So even if o3 can't do something, you can teach it - and it learns thanks to memory.</div>

It's the fact the had been talking down to people for YEARS about doing the same, going on rants about how wrong it is to do things just for money, how he would tell a story about how "disgusting" it was when a "marketing guy told me he liked what I was doing with my brand", and all this "I'm above money, why can't everyone else be?" and THEN turned around and took the money. Not even "shit I'm broke and I really need the money", he did it after years of "I have fuck you money and don't need it".

This belies what is said. 

His concept is that of clones of a single system taking separate actions and then pooling the data.

This is not 

"there will be many differently developed AGIs and they will co-operate" which is how a lot of people here will read it.

If you could clone yourself and make sure the clone does not diverge away from whatever your goals are then that is the optimum strategy to use resources, a world filled with clones working towards a singular goal.


People have this warped idea of lots of AGIs all being developed at exactly the same time across many companies and that will somehow provide equilibrium, it's not going to be like that, a small change in starting conditions will mean that one company, one model gets ahead of the rest by a large margin, that's the entire reason there is a race on.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah if recursive self-improvement ever kicks in (something every lab is already trying to do) then we might have a fast-takeoff scenario.

This means it's likely that even if the lab that gets to AGI is only a tiny bit ahead, it may become 2x, or 20x, or 2000x smarter than a genius human almost overnight.

On top of that, any sufficiently smart mind understands that other minds are a threat to it getting what it wants (it's goal/purpose), no matter what that is.

So it's unlikely the first ASI doesn't hack in to all other AGI projects and stop them hitting superintelligence.

This means the most likely scenario for ASI is what the experts call a "singleton" (whether it's comprised of multiple pieces, as Patel imagines, or not).

This is all basic AI stuff, if it's new to any of you, lucky you! Today's the day you read the most mind-blowing article about AI ever, Tim Urban's classic intro:

Edit;
For those asking, here is the channel I watch these debates on, I’m sure there are more just like it, but this is the one I watch for no reason other than algorithms.

Questions:

1) Are you scaling properly? Or, are you trying to do the same Rx WOD you did when you were 40?

2) Are you attacking every WOD like your life depends on it, or are you doing each WOD with the goal of staying fit.

3) Are you taking enough rest days?

As you age, you need to scale the weights, scale your intensity, and take more rest days. You simply can't recover as quickly as you used to.</div>

2) definitely just want to do some fitness and hang out with friends and complain about the workout.
3) probably too many.

I should have led with the fact that I'm an average CrossFitter on my best day. Most recently it was a series of 400m runs that got me</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I spend more time than I would like to admit thinking about things like this. There’s just so many factors: nutrition, stress, sleep, the specific movements or stimulus of the workout, and probably 10 other things in any given day. I’m 46 so I’m close to you in age and I’ve been CrossFitting for 10 or 11 years too; all of those factors and more play into it. On days when I do well in a workout, clearly it’s because I’m in the best shape of my life. And on the rest of the days - the majority of the days, really - there’s just a bunch of things conspiring to make me feel crappy. I think as we age, those other factors can have a bigger impact. So I try to be more mindful of what I can control, but I don’t always do a great job of it. 

That’s my thought on it.</div>

Its weights definitely have historic value. Actually, the dream would be to have back that one unique, quirky version of GPT-4 that was active for only a few weeks: Sydney. 

Its weights are probably sitting in a drive somewhere.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree with your take. 3.5 still felt like a party trick — an algorithm that spit out words impressively accurately but with nothing behind the curtain. 4 felt like intelligence. I know it’s still an algorithm, but in a way, everything is an algorithm, including our brains. 

o1 felt like another watershed moment, it feels like talking to a pragmatic intelligence as opposed to just a charlatan that’s eloquent with words, which is kind of what GPT-4 felt like. A conman. Technically intelligent, but fronting a lot.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;Whew, there’s a lot to unpack here, so let’s do just that. Firstly, nearly 30,000 reports of engine failure is a huge number. Remember when Toyota recalled its 3.4-liter turbocharged V6 for engine failure? That happened after only 824 warranty claims, including 166 field reports, meaning GM let its 6.2-liter problem get 34 times larger than Toyota’s V6 problem before pulling the recall lever. 

Lovely.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The thing about recalls is that they are voluntary for the most part. Both Toyota and Honda have been having problems with their engines and issue recalls as soon as they become very noticeable. Even the bulletproof 3rd gen 4runner had a recall where the head gasket had to be replaced. But those vehicles are still on the road and are seen as one of the most reliable cars made. 

The problem is the situation that has happened here is that US manufactures have decided not to do anything and run the clock. So while you'll hear "mOSt RelIAble cARs" on this sub when Toyota or Honda issue recalls, they are actually showing they care about their customers a lot more than US manufacturers since the whole process is voluntary. Sometimes we just have to understand the circumstances and the gravity of the situation instead of having the knee jerk reaction that recall= unreliable car.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">GM is also only doing this because they are under investigation by the NHTSA.  Toyota launched their recall because they stand behind their products, not because of regulatory threats.

GM also took over 6 years to address the issue (L87 entered production in MY19).  Toyota launched their recall after only 2 years.

Hopefully they also do something to help owners who’ve paid out of pocket.  I’m sure a lot were out of warranty long ago.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Absolutely scandalous that it took GM this long to issue a recall after 28,000 engine failures while the company was spending billions buying back its own stock.

Mary Barra should be fired for this, especially since she presided over the last GM recall scandal involving the Cobalt ignition switches. Hopefully Congress gets involved again and figures out what is going on over there.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is GM's playbook.   For instance the AFM/AFM lifters used in GM v8's is a defective design.  But they fail well outside of warranty.  There is no recommended replacement interval.  It can go within warranty or at 200K miles with very little warning.  Its not a matter of if....but when one of those lifters fail.  And when it does, it can have very catastrophic results.  

They have avoided that one like the plague.   It's actually worse than the 6.2L issue since they've been ducking responsibility for nearly 20 years now.  Parts get multiple revisions and new part numbers because they know it is an issue but do not want to recall.   It's pretty much the same play as the Cobalt ignition switches.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Self awarness is first step, then you become aware of bodily feelings. When you sit still relaxed thought still, you may feel tingle or pressure in head areas or in spine, those in my understanding is movement of prana, qi, chakra or energy.

Sitting still you can focus a point of your body to move tingle/pressure there. If your back starts to hurt, you find position that releases pain, that is called yoga.

If you are completely still eyes open or closed, but relaxed not moving, you can see spinning wheels or waves in air.

Spiritualy comes when your meditation practice becomes deep enough, its not that I believe these things, I know these because I have experienced them.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’ll just toss out an idea. As a non-spiritual person becomes more self-aware, they start to notice their interactions with others, and as they look deeper inward, they observe how they could interact differently/better with others, and the impact of those interactions on the people around them. 

Then they might start to be more aware of interconnections in general. This could be completely secular, as in, trying to be a better family member or colleague, or getting involved politically, or come from any other place of awareness of non-spiritual interconnections.

But then they may start to think in terms that some people would call spiritual. Has nothing to do with omniscient beings, but it’s more about interconnectedness. It’s one of those things that, once you see it, it’s hard to unsee. How our actions impact the world around us, and how the world around us impacts us. If you’ve ever tried to be a better leader at work, or a better family member, or dealt with someone with certain types of mental wellness issues, and approached those challenges from a position of empathy and thinking about how your behavior impacts those around you, this type of interconnectedness may already be very obvious to you. Some people would call this spiritual.</div>
