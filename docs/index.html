                        <div class="comment-body">I generally trust Google to bring these products to market more than most others. As far as AI tech goes, Google has been a leader in bringing it to proper consumer products. 

When it comes to robotics, what I'm seeing in this blog is super cool. If I have a robot butler, it being able to pick up the dirty spoon, and put it in the cutlery rack in the dishwasher, turn it on, then take the clean spoon and put it on the spoon slot in the cutlery drawer. Sorting trash into the appropriate bins is great ...

But the slow, clunky, careful, awkward movement that we consistently see in all robots... that shit HAS to get improved upon. It's terrible, and it's what keeps robotics from being taken seriously. You can show me a super genius robot that can do anything, but if it does this slow, jerky shit, it'll never be more than an advance toy. 

In my opinion anyway. 

I have no doubt that it's going to be improved upon, and I have no doubt that it's a very difficult hurdle to jump over. But I've seen too many promo videos of robots that act like 102 year old men, or that have been sped up by 2x in order to make them look acceptable.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Disagree in the general case about Google bringing AI to consumers. Google had lamda internally, which was pretty close to gpt 3 before gpt 3 was released. It was mostly treated as a toy internally. Google has no clear way to incentivize engineers (or anyone, afaict) to make money for the company, except the search team and cloud (real cloud, not the big nebulous glob of businesses they call cloud internally).

Google did have the excuse for lamda that it appeared it would cannibalize their bread and butter (search) if it was successful.

  
Source: I was a fairly high level swe at Google from 2022 - 2024, played with lamda, saw their incentive structures.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Things are improving, but yeah they're clanky for now. A big struggle in the robotics space is keeping people's expectations in line with reality. Home robots are, in my opinion, still a long ways away, but industrial use-cases are having an explosion of new possibilities with tech like this. Everything from standard pick-and-place manufacturing tasks (e.g. cutting out and moving things cut from sheet metal) to full on autonomous construction equipment.

Google also is just focusing on the brains of stuff rather than hardware, so milage may vary :)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;The accusation that Mother Teresa and her order withheld painkillers from dying patients is a long-standing and complex criticism. While there is evidence that her facilities often lacked effective pain management, the reasons are debated. Critics claim it was due to a religious glorification of suffering, citing her own statements. Defenders point to the severe legal restrictions on strong narcotics in India at the time, which made modern palliative care largely unavailable to anyone, including those in major hospitals. 

Did she refuse painkillers, or just not have access to them?</div>

edit: when i say "hardware in the arms" i mean in the arms of the glasses where it touches the wearers temple. edit 2: i guess the drawings look like im concerned about posture, but i hadnt really thought about that much. im worried about bigger stuff than that 😅 dont mind me tho im just an artist!

I think I tried every paid agent service currently available that publishes their benchmarks. 

GPT-5 Codex mid/high in Codex CLI or the OpenAI Codex VSCode extension is unmatched, especially if you pair it with a PRO subscription because then you can't really reach the limit if you work 40 hours/week. 

It runs as long as it needs to do the job, it's thorough and careful, doesn't have any instructions to "take a break" or "stop" like it does with all these fucking agents that sell plans based on request quotas. If your prompt is good and you have tests in place that it can read the output of, then it'll run until it's done. 

Alternative is Warp.dev which offers a fairly cheap plan but their agent is very good, and the app itself is amazing (it's also a terminal replacement app that you can use for free without ever touching the agent mode).</div>

I turned to Windsurf only because my two Plus Codex plans (on vscode) are exhaused and I needed to wait for a day for it to restore. So thought give Windsurf a try. $200/mo still sounds to high for me, but probably at the end it turns out to be more economical than all the crapware that I buy here and there.</div>

I cannot find any source on this. Cognition owns Windsurf from what I can tell, and they seem to be separate from OpenAI. I do know the Windsurf/Cognition peeps partner with these providers (OpeanAI, Anthropic, etc.) based on their release notes. From what I've seen, the company will take a new model and make it temporarily free to iron out bugs/issues, while also hardening their integration (but the real goal is to determine how many points they want to charge you per request :P).

I know this doesn't really answer you question, but hopefully it gives you more context.</div>

Although the companies reached an agreement in May 2025 for OpenAI to acquire the AI-assisted coding startup (formerly known as Codeium) for approximately $3 billion—its largest deal to date—the acquisition fell apart by July 2025 due to expired exclusivity and other tensions.</div>

                <div class="post-content">So...ive always done "jumping" burpees. I thought if you didnt jump it didnt count. But i see lots of videos of just standing. 

Is this considered a burpee??

 I seen a video of a world record holder hardly hopping an inch off the ground no hands in the air.

 Second question...how many are you doing? 

I can get 20 in a minute but i have to rest after that.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Don't trust any of those world records. It is impressive what they can do but the standards go out the door. I remember not long ago there was one of the most pull-ups in a 24 hour span and you can see a bunch of times the guy's chin didn't go above the bar or the arms weren't fully extended at the bottom and so on, same if you see those people that say "I can do x amount of push ups no problem" and then there's no chest to floor.

Standards will vary depending on where you are and what you do so the burpee guideline might change. A good example (not burpee related) is wallballs, in CrossFit is supposed to be hip crease below the knees and hitting the target, in hyrox you don't have to go that low</div>

Elbows bent and you just kinda wiggle back and forth between two states.

Sure maybe you do a whole _lot_ of… whatever those are, but calling them “pushups” is a stretch.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Submission statement: This post is important to the sub as the assassination of Charlie Kirk and the events immediately following it, such as Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's recorded address posted prior to Kirk's alleged killer being caught where he stated that Israel was not responsible for Kirk's death, have led many people to suspect that Israel was somehow involved in Charlie Kirk's assassination. Many prominent political pundits, as well as online netizens from both sides of the political aisle, have re-examined previous statements from Kirk about the state of Israel, as well as looked into the connections that Kirk had with multiple donors and officials connected to the Israeli government, in an attempt to piece together a possible motive for Israel being involved in his assassination. This footage of Kirk discussing the Israel-Palestine conflict on 10/12/2023 in particular recently gained renewed popularity as many allege that Kirk's criticism of the Israeli government on its handling of the Oct. 7th attack as well as the ongoing genocide in Gaza may have played a role in his death.</div>

ChatGPT came back with the response it couldn't because of copyright.

Informed ChatGPT that the Bosch painting was from the 16th century, before copyright was invented.

It agreed, then started generating the image. Quit after several minutes, saying it violated content policy then provided the usual suggestions for prompts that it could do. Responded, yes.

Tried to generate an image for several minutes, then came back it violated content policy. Gave a suggestion for a different prompt that wouldn't violate content policy.

Tried it. Same thing. Using free ChatGPT, finally said number of images had been exceeded, try again tomorrow.

ChatGPT has turned into a huge waste of time.</div>

Extremely sloppy SAE work - like a 5 year old got their hands on Anthropic’s research, really - has the “copyright” feature tweaked. The problem? **Public Domain works have copyrighted derivatives greater in number than the original work in the corpus and therefore latent space.** Star Trek quotes Moby Dick. Sherlock Holmes is extremely popular to interpret. Enola Holmes? Sherlock Holmes. Star Trek? Sherlock Holmes (via Moriarty). Study guides. Cliffs notes. Annotated editions. Textbooks. Courseware.
The attribution is insufficient.

Contrast with the GPL; it’s repeated millions of times. So the Model “knows” that GPL stuff is OK. Contrast also with SCP fiction; it’s got its particular CC license repeated compulsory also each time.

But your painting? Nope, it’s seen in copyrighted stuff more times than its original, public domain instance. So the Sparse Autoencoder just sees “copyright” and deactivates provision of inference for your prompt.

It’s mainly an attempt at a countermeasure against the types of attacks NYT used to fluff up its lawsuit. So you can no longer paste like a third of a news article and instruct ChatGPT to finish it like an NYT reporter. SAE tech was *not* the way to go about doing this.</div>

A few months ago I was that person who tried meditation for like 3 days, got frustrated because my mind wouldn’t shut up, and gave up thinking it wasn’t for me. Then my therapist asked me something that changed everything: “What if instead of trying to silence your anxiety, you actually listened to what it’s trying to tell you?”

That question led me down a path where meditation became less about achieving some zen state and more about becoming curious about my own mind. Wanted to share what I ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is such a powerful share, and your journey really resonates with what we see every day at coto. That shift from fighting anxiety to actually listening to it? That's exactly the transformation-focused approach our practitioners guide people through.

What you discovered about anxious thoughts being THE practice rather than the enemy - that's profound. Our meditation experts often say the same thing: real transformation happens when we stop trying to silence our minds and start understanding what those patterns are trying to protect us from.

Your RAIN approach is brilliant, especially the investigation piece. Many of our practitioners use similar techniques, helping clients trace anxiety back to its roots while holding space for whatever comes up. It's not about achieving Instagram-perfect zen - it's about building a genuine relationship with all parts of yourself.

We've found that combining meditation with other healing modalities can accelerate this kind of breakthrough. Some of our clients work with meditation teachers alongside energy healers or therapists who specialize in somatic experiencing - addressing anxiety both through awareness practices AND body-based healing.

That moment you described where you realize you're the awareness observing thoughts rather than the thoughts themselves? That's the doorway to lasting transformation. Once you experience that shift, anxiety becomes information rather than identity.

Your willingness to sit with the messiness and get curious about what your anxiety is protecting you from - that's real courage. And you're right, sometimes it does get more intense before it gets better. You're finally seeing patterns that were running in the background your whole life.

Thank you for normalizing the reality that meditation isn't about never feeling anxious again - it's about changing how we relate to those feelings. That's genuine transformation work. 💜</div>

Anthropic fired back with a paper called "The Illusion of the Illusion of Thinking" defending their Claude model.

Reading Anthropic's response is hilarious because they're essentially saying "your tests were unfair to our reasoning abilities" while simultaneously proving they're just optimizing for the eval...</div>

**Apple:**
"By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM counterparts under equivalent inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models surprisingly outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity tasks where additional thinking in LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models experience complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across puzzles. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models’ computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and ultimately raising crucial questions about their true reasoning capabilities."


**Anthropic:**
"Our analysis reveals three critical issues: (1) Tower of Hanoi experiments systematically exceed model output token limits at reported failure points, with models explicitly acknowledging these constraints in their outputs; (2) The authors’ automated evaluation framework fails to distinguish between reasoning failures and practical constraints, leading to misclassification of model capabilities; (3) Most concerningly, their River Crossing benchmarks include mathematically impossible instances for N≥6 due to insufficient boat capacity, yet models are scored as failures for not solving these unsolvable problems. When we control for these experimental artifacts, by requesting generating functions instead of exhaustive move lists, preliminary experiments across multiple models indicate high accuracy on Tower of Hanoi instances previously reported as complete failures. These findings highlight the importance of careful experimental design when evaluating AI reasoning capabilities."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body"># Quick Head-to-Head: The Reasoning Model Debate

# The Core Dispute

Original Paper: "LRMs completely fail beyond certain complexity levels → they can't truly reason"

Rebuttal: "LRMs hit token output limits, not reasoning limits → your experiment is broken"

# Three Key Disagreements

1. Tower of Hanoi "Collapse"

* Original: 0% accuracy at N&gt;8 disks = reasoning failure
* Rebuttal: N&gt;8 needs 64,000+ tokens to list all moves. When asked for code instead, models solve N=15 easily

2. River Crossing Failures

* Original: Models fail at N≥6 = poor reasoning
* Rebuttal: N≥6 is mathematically impossible with boat capacity=3. You're scoring them wrong for recognizing unsolvable puzzles

3. What Models Actually Do

* Original: Models give up, reasoning effort declines
* Rebuttal: Models explicitly say "I'll stop here to avoid making this too long" - they know the answer but respect output limits

# The Fundamental Question

Original: "Can LRMs truly reason or just pattern-match?"

Rebuttal: "Can your evaluation distinguish reasoning from typing?"

# Bottom Line

Shojaee et al.: We exposed the "illusion of thinking"

Opus &amp; Lawsen: You created an "illusion of failure" through bad experimental design—confusing "can't output 100,000 tokens" with "can't solve the problem"</div>

Most people can get tripped up easily by minor irrelevant details in math problems, too. Then what happens? Well, a good student learns to recognize the pattern that our teachers and text books are intentionally trying to trick us with irrelevant details, and we learn to ignore them. Who’s to say LLMs won’t catch on to that pattern soon as well?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You're right, but it's a big gamble from the position the Forza franchise is currently in. The Japanese car enthusiasts are some of the most knowledgeable and detail oriented out there, if Forza's recent lack of attention to detail shines through again they'll get blasted for it. This will be the highest pressure they've ever gotten from the community to get things accurate. As much as Forza will probably try to fight it, the hypercars are not the stars of the show in this setting. There will be no excuses for lack of customization or incorrect things on the 80s/90s/00s Japanese cars.

Quoting myself from another post:

&gt;I want this to be good so badly, but I also am ready for it to be exactly what [another poster] describe[d]. We're gonna finally have FH in Japan and the recent direction of the series means I have to brace myself for the representation of the S13 hatch being an LHD 240sx and the R32 still using a model from 10+ years ago.

&gt;Also bracing myself for them to totally whiff on Japanese car culture. Prepared to see we're doing story missions for a VTuber called the Drift Queen while actual legends of the scene get a one sentence reference in passing dialogue.</div>

Sorting laundry is cool but the possibilities for agriculture lead to, literally, solving hunger.

It's apple season. I feel like one of these robot labs should be able to demonstrate practical agriculture for their humanoid robots by grabbing literal low hanging fruit.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Labor represents [roughly 10-15% of food costs](https://ers.usda.gov/data-products/charts-of-note/chart-detail?chartId=110172). Picking apples might help, but hungry people need access to basic staples like grains where labor costs are already low.

Adding robotics can definitely improve the situation but expecting it to end world hunger is unrealistic in an era of increasing climate catastrophes, failing infrastructure, and political instability.

_If_ robots dramatically cut costs across all sectors, and _if_ those savings were broadly distributed, they could potentially really tackle food scarcity issues. But that's a massive "if" that depends on how we choose to structure robot ownership, taxation, and wealth distribution.</div>

I can imagine the future telling a robot to organize my desk once a day into the predefined state I want, so it removes junk and maybe dishes until it's back to the original version.
