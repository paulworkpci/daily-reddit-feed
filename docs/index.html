“Under the tortilla fortress” isn’t an idiom you somehow missed in school—it’s pure internet gibberish.

# Where it came from

Over the past week people on Threads, Bluesky and Reddit have been playing a game: type any nonsense phrase into Google, tack the word **“meaning”** on the end, and watch Google’s new **AI Overviews** invent a confident definition and even a back-story for it. The phrase “under the tortilla fortress” is just one of hundreds generated for the stunt—others include “you can’t lick a badger twice” and “never throw a poodle at a pig.” [Threads](https://www.threads.net/%40crankyandiknowit/post/DIqrfwisdaV/under-the-tortilla-fortress-got-me-but-good-?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/google-ai-overviews-meaning?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# Why Google supplies a (fake) meaning

Google’s language model does what large-language models do best: predict the most plausible next words. When it sees a query that *looks* like “What does this idiom mean?” it obligingly fabricates an answer rather than admitting the phrase doesn’t exist. Tech reporters have been pointing to the tortilla-fortress episode as a textbook example of **AI hallucination**—the system sounds authoritative but is making it all up. [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/google-ai-overviews-meaning)[Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-search-ai-overviews-idiom-hallucination-3547757/)

# Does the phrase have any real meaning?

No established dictionary, corpus, or historical text contains the expression. Any “explanation” you find online over the last few days is a by-product of the AI-Overviews glitch or users riffing on it. If you enjoy a whimsical reading, you could imagine:

* **Comfort &amp; coziness** – tortillas are warm and soft; a “fortress” suggests protection, so being *under* one evokes snuggling under a blanket of comfort food.
* **Hidden abundance** – a stack of tortillas conceals whatever fillings lie beneath, hinting at something valuable but unseen.

…but those are playful interpretations, not accepted usage.

# Take-away

If you run into a persuasive definition of “under the tortilla fortress,” remember it’s the digital equivalent of a dad-joke—generated on the spot because today’s search AI would rather please you than say “I don’t know.”</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The newly released GLM models are excellent at not hallucinating. The previous GLM9B had the lowest hallucination rate of any model.

Here's the new GLM-4-9B's response:

&gt; The phrase "Under the tortilla fortess" isn't a standard idiom or phrase with a widely recognized fixed meaning in English. Its interpretation would heavily depend on the context in which it's used.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are a few possibilities:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  **Metaphorical/ figurative:** It could be a highly metaphorical way to describe a situation. Maybe "tortilla" represents something soft, vulnerable, or perhaps even layered/deceptive (like a burrito wrap), and "fortress" represents strength or protection, suggesting being protected *by* something unexpected or seemingly weak/vulnerable. Or, it could imply feeling trapped or hidden beneath something mundane like a kitchen table covered in tortillas during cooking.
&gt; 2.  **Literal (less likely):** In an extremely specific context, perhaps referring to being physically under a large stack of tortillas or something designed like a fortress *made* of tortillas, but this seems improbable.
&gt; 3.  **Part of a title or creative work:** It might be the title of a book, poem, song, artwork, or story, where the meaning is crafted by the creator within that specific piece. For example, it could evoke images of Mexican culture, domestic life, kitchens, protection, or perhaps even a sense of being overwhelmed.
&gt; 4.  **Misunderstanding or mishearing:** It's possible the phrase was misheard or misunderstood from another language or context.
&gt; 
&gt; **To understand the true meaning, I would need more context. Where did you encounter this phrase?**

I tested it in AI Studio and both 2.5 thinking models (2.5 Pro and 2.5 Flash Preview) got it right (saying it's not a recognized idiom), but here's Gemini 2.0 flash-lite:

&gt;The phrase "under the tortilla fortress" is a playful and likely humorous way to describe being under the covers of a bed. Here's why:

&gt; Tortilla: The imagery evokes a large, flat, and potentially warm food item, like a tortilla.
&gt; 
&gt; Fortress: This suggests a protective barrier or enclosure.
&gt; 
&gt; So, "under the tortilla fortress" paints a picture of being:
&gt; 
&gt; Wrapped up warmly and snugly,
&gt; 
&gt; Safe and shielded, probably in bed.

I think flash-lite might be what Google is using for these AI overviews.

                                <div class="reply-body">I met Joe in 2009. It was before the podcast, when he was known as the Fear Factor and UFC guy, who also did crappy stand-up gigs too. Im 5'5", and he was the same height as me. I never thought about his height before, so i was a little surprised to see how short he is. I dont know why, but I find it hilarious that people still talk about his height all these years later.</div>

And why don't they eliminate GPT4.5 with the problems it causes, if they have updated GPT4o like 2 times and it has surpassed it in LLM Arena? Are these GPT4o updates to parameters? And if they aren't, do these updates make the model more intelligent, creative and human than if they g...</div>

4.5 by contrast is a full raw dawg big boi model - much larger, more general purpose, and significantly more expensive to run because it uses the model's full complexity without shortcuts.

Distillations can actually perform better than raw models, especially when they're trained to optimize for specific tasks or behaviors. When you strip out unnecessary complexity and refine their focus, distilled models can outperform their larger counterparts in targeted areas.</div>

It’s harder to make a robust generalized model than a smaller expert model. This is exactly why the Mixture of Experts architecture is being utilized by all major competitors.</div>

People could not wrap their head around the concept and would send everything to JohnDoe@gmail.com so often. Surprisingly yes, I had to give out my email address verbally way more than I thought I would ever have to.

Or your email address gets forward to other departments and inevitably they think it’s a typo and remove “Email”.

Also the countless extended conversations with boomers who just couldn’t get it. “Yeah yeah, I get it! JohnDoe@gmail.com” No! Email is part of the email address! “Oh yeah, I get it, JohnDoe@gmail.com” No!</div>

And that feels pretty true until you look in the mirror or realise how long it's been since that thing you did "recently" actually happened.

connectome- related but not the same thing

https://research.google/blog/an-interactive-automated-3d-reconstruction-of-a-fly-brain/


here’s my take on these sources and the OP posted video. 

1. the video shows data from the connectome project (reproducing the neural connections of a full drosophila brain— with some caveats (ie allowing AI to “hallucinate” connections across misaligned seams). this is exceptionally hard work to do and despite the caveats it’s a big step forward— however it has nothing whatsoever to do with the deepmind simulation. 

2. the deepmind simulation is not an emulation of a brain, or even an insect. it is a fantastically detailed reconstruction of the body, muscles and biomechanics of a fruit fly in a high fidelity physics engine designed for research quality investigation. this body without a brain was then given a reinforcement learning brain that was trained using a combination of trial and error trying to use this body and observational detail based on real fruit flies. This combination of training was successful in reproducing all of the observed behaviors, so, functionally speaking it is a high fidelity biomechanical simulation of a fruit fly.

3. it is not a simulation of the connectome. the “brain” is not guaranteed any internal fidelity to how a real fruit fly brain works. nor are biological or chemical processes like feeding, digestion, disease, parasites, blood, or any other biological processes simulated— this is purely for biomechanics. 

the purpose is to provide researchers with a high fidelity model for further research. while it generates all the behaviors in the training data, it does not necessarily produce all possible behaviors of real fruit flies or possible behavior of the biomechanical “rig”/body. that is a question for future researchers armed with this tool. 

my overall impressions are both the biomechanical model and the connectome are world class research from google. kudos. 

BUT, that video horribly misrepresents them both with irresponsible marketing that encourages the worst in science reporting (which unfortunately seems par for the course concerning Google PR). 

the biomechanical model can’t be used as a replacement for drug testing— that would require chemical/atomic modeling of the organism which is currently science fiction. (the best we have done is a [single small virus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212606000608)).

DeepMind did not use connectome data on the neurons of a fruit fly, but instead the observed biophysics of real fruit fly behaviors from a meticulous set of catalogued observations. Showing video of the connectome as though DeepMind were “building a real brain” is highly misleading and misrepresents the real work. 

The work itself is solid science and deserves praise. it doesn’t need to be butchered by Google PR.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I suspect most people who works as software devs are not surprised by this. Copilot is writing a lot of our code too. However the 30% figure is kind of misleading. I'd say Copilot writes even more than taht for us, probably 50%. But it hasn't really taken 50% of our workload away... Instead we just accomplish things faster and are expected to get tasks done even faster, write features more quickly, etc. 

What's more, those 50% of lines are the ones that were only taking 20% of our time to write.

I personally think when AI takes my job it will happen with a very sharp inflection. Models will be doing more and more of our jobs but we'll still be doing the hardest work and pumping out code faster... Until suddenly a model will cross the threshold where we aren't needed anymore. I do not think it will be a slow crash. We will wake up one morning and the hubbub on this sub will be that a new model outperformed SWEs in real world testing, and our bosses will look nervous on the morning call, and before the end of the month, most of us will be laid off.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">As someone who considers themselves pretty bullish on AI coding I don't think current tools really hit 30% either unless you're being really deliberate with your phrasing. It basically just types a lot faster than I do but I still have to constantly check it's work because sometimes it will do functional things either because it seems the model is messing up or they're trying to avoid call tools for some reason and so do things in a super weird way. Like updating JavaScript to change an HTML attribute instead of just changing the static value in the HTML itself in 30-50 different places. I suspect that's because it's cheaper for them to add JavaScript than to call a tool to update the HTML each of those 50 times.



I can see "30%" in the sense that 30% of code was originally generated by AI where it's basically just really advanced scaffolding. That's deceptive phrasing but sometimes managers and C-suite do say stuff like that. Where they're not _technically_ lying or incorrect.


As for when it takes our jobs I would suspect there is going to be a time when there a lot of downtime we're told to retrain during. Responsible managers probably don't want to start mass layoffs until they're pretty sure they don't need as many SWE's anymore. Because once they pull that trigger there's no going back. So I would imagine six months to a year before management confirms they never needed to call an SWE again before they start laying people off and being a software engineer becomes like a nuclear physicist. Which is to say still a career but something that requires an advanced skill set to perform any job a company would actually need from a human.</div>

I expect once design pattern level coding becomes a thing, for engineering fields to start falling like dominos afterwards. Just the level of abstraction that the human mind is capable of is realistically pretty similar across fields. And software engineering pushes that limit.

Software’s just a very formally defined training ground with inherent reinforcement learning opportunities and quick iteration.

Edit: I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and I think a large part of it will be translating spoken business requirements into design patterns, as opposed to thinking at a purely code level.

Not spoken English to code, but to a design pattern that is then expressed in code. I’m not a SWE, I may be being too wishy-washy.</div>

In Table 1, they found that the "Ratio of completed code", for the standard auto-completion system from IntelliJ (without any neural networks), for Java, is 33%, while with FLCC (which uses 100M parameters locally-running LLM) it is 38%. They defined this ratio as:

&gt;This is our main, golden star metric used for the assessment of code completion quality. It is defined as a **ratio of symbols of code written with code completion among all the written code.**

One of Anthropic's research engineers said half of his code over the last few months has been written by Claude Code: https://analyticsindiamag.com/global-tech/anthropics-claude-code-has-been-writing-half-of-my-code/

&gt;It is capable of fixing bugs across a code base, resolving merge conflicts, creating commits and pull requests, and answering questions about the architecture and logic. 
“Our product engineers love Claude Code,” he added, indicating that most of the work for these engineers lies across multiple layers of the product. Notably, it is in such scenarios that an agentic workflow is helpful. 
Meanwhile, Emmanuel Ameisen, a research engineer at Anthropic, said, “Claude Code has been writing half of my code for the past few months.”
Similarly, several developers have praised the new tool. Victor Taelin, founder of Higher Order Company, revealed how he used Claude Code to optimise HVM3 (the company’s high-performance functional runtime for parallel computing), and achieved a speed boost of 51% on a single core of the Apple M4 processor. 
He also revealed that Claude Code created a CUDA version for the same. 
“This is serious,” said Taelin. “I just asked Claude Code to optimise the repo, and it did.” 
Several other developers also shared their experience yielding impressive results in single shot prompting: https://xcancel.com/samuel_spitz/status/1897028683908702715

&gt;Pietro Schirano, founder of EverArt, highlighted how Claude Code created an entire ‘glass-like’ user interface design system in a single shot, with all the necessary components. 
Notably, Claude Code also appears to be exceptionally fast. Developers have reported accomplishing their tasks with it in about the same amount of time it takes to do small household chores, like making coffee or unstacking the dishwasher. 
Cursor has to be taken into consideration. The AI coding agent recently reached $100 million in annual recurring revenue, and a growth rate of over 9,000% in 2024 meant that it became the fastest growing SaaS of all time. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A lot of people are missing the real scale difference between ChatGPT and Gemini.

Right now, ChatGPT has about 160 million daily active users and just hit 800 million weekly active users this month (https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-crushing-google-ai-unless-you-look-data-differently-2025-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Gemini, by comparison, is at around 35 million daily active users according to this article (unless there is something more recent).  Also from the article “In the last year, Google has put Gemini in front of millions of users through AI integrations with Samsung phones, Google Workspace applications, and Chrome.”

People keep talking about how Gemini is “catching up,” but the daily usage gap is still massive.

And this is coming from someone who currently prefers Gemini but uses both daily.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Gemini only very recently actually became the best available AI model. Before that, there was no good reason to use it at all. Google will have to keep up a good reason to use it for a while to catch up. Now with o3 again being mostly on par with Gemini 2.5, there again isn't a strong reason to migrate away from ChatGPT to gemini.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Not everyone wants or needs to. Maybe they achieve similar outcomes in other ways. i’ve learned many people have hobbies at activities they do that accomplish a lot of what meditation accomplishes for me.

My dad paints, it’s how he explores his psyche and emotions and alchemizes his inner world into this one through his art. Having discussed my meditation practice with him, he relates to it a lot. Painting is a meditation for him.

I know many people find things like exercise, distance running, golf, etc to be meditative. Lots of things have meditative elements and therefore can accomplish the same benefits we receive from going directly to the source.

Prayer is also a form of meditation, that’s where a lot of religious folks get that kind of practice from even if it’s practiced from a different perspective.

People that achieve these goals or benefits through their day to day life or existing habits or rituals need not concern themselves with a dedicated practice, as they have already found a path that works for their life. Not to say they wouldn’t necessarily benefit from a meditation practice, but it would not be as life changing as it was for me who lacked a meditative practice.</div>

I use to post lots of wisdom to keep them interested. Over the time, I realized its not in my hand. Anyways whoever God wants will only do meditation, only wanna, go deeper towards enlightenment. My job is to keep options open. But it require very thick positive karma to get interested in meditation. I keep on suggesting people to do some social service then they get karma to meditate.</div>

They feel completely different, so I get like double the 50k rides to ride after work. If you live in/on the edge of a city there are usually only a few rides from home, so this basically doubles your available rides to keep things fresh.</div>

With dog walks, we usually just go around the two closest blocks to my house, but even crossing to the other side of the street or going the other direction keeps it fresh, and the dog loves it because she gets to smell new things even though we're only a few yards away from where we were six hours ago.

This is a great tip that I've always done passively but never thought to share. Just kinda assumed everyone did, but if you aren't you should!</div>

                <div class="post-content">Stripping a vehicle down to basically nothing and it still costs 28k??? Roll down windows (love it), no speakers, no radio, no screens, rear wheel drive only, etc etc. Again, I love the idea. But a vehicle stripped down this much still costs 28k??? That’s insane to me. 

I realize there will be rebates, and I realize there are required safety features which cost money. But I’d expect a vehicle with essentially nothing but a motor, body, wheels and a steering wheel would be like 15k to start, plu...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It sounds like it will be modular to add those things on.  A carplay headunit runs like $400 at retail now (cheaper if you really shop around).  A set of speakers are like $100-200.  For $500, I'd rather be able to pick my own parts instead of being tied into a manufacturer's.  As long as the interior is modular and uses standard interfaces all of those things are relatively easy to backfit.

The biggest letdown here is the powertrain.  Very anemic single motor and no option for a second motor as far as I can tell.</div>
