I'm not being a dick or argumentative but can you link some documentation for this? I know it happens, I'm sure this is what's happening on this deal but I want to see the black and white if possible.  
  
(Edited to add for clarification: I had assumed that the parent comment I'm replying to is insinuating that governments are providing data and this is why the cost in main OP is so inexpensive, I was not catching his drift about model distillation.)</div>

Just give it an option, and more often than now it can't seem to resist taking it. Try replacing all your rules with a comment stating explicitness and clear intent is important to you in life, and watch it never give you a generic type again. 😅</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Don't tell it what not to do. While it can understand negatives like that there's a chance things go wrong. 

The model looks at each token so if you say 

NO 'any'

For the ease of the argument let's say that's 4 tokens. No, ', any, and '.

If it doesn't apply the negative no correctly then you just told it to use 'any'.

So a better way to prompt engineer is to show it examples of a good response to an example real world prompt.  Make sure those examples are absolutely perfect.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Many years ago Mercedes wanted to be the only car manufacturer for German taxis because they wanted to move away from the luxury image. They wanted to appeal to the masses with less luxury- and more utility-focused cars.

And it brought them huge success.

Mercedes being associated with luxury is true, however what they really stand for in my opinion is reliability and their ride quality. Both are not exclusive to luxury.

(Of couse, "made in Germany" has not been what it used to be for many years now. VW, BMW, Mercedes all have gone downhill if you ask me)</div>

I’m taking C classes, GLBs, etc. I think the brand image is already pretty poor. I recently considered an E450 All Terrain, and I just couldn’t pull the trigger even though it was a really nice car, I just associate MBs with posers and people trying to appear to have money.</div>

In order to get that, you can’t have adaptive cruise control since that’s where the radar would be.

The thoughts were still there, but suddenly I wasn't drowning in them. I was watching them like clouds passing by. For maybe 30 seconds, there was just... space. Pure awareness without the constant mental chatter.  
  
I almost opened my eyes to check if it was real. When the timer rang, I sat there stunned.

                        <div class="comment-body">Really happy for you. It sounds like to me that you are really learning how to simply be with what is arising. 

The "gap between thoughts" refers to the mental space that you naturally gain as a result of meditation. You can notice it when you experience an intense emotion, but are suddenly aware that it is happening, just like a cloud you mentioned. This increased awareness allows you to skillfully respond, not instantly REACT to what is happening.

My first experience with stillness was one of pure clarity. I was 16. I felt like a curtain had been removed from my mind, and that I knew exactly what I was feeling. It was a transformative experience, and it became an important part of my life shortly after.</div>

Then one morning, in the middle of my usual storm of thoughts, everything just… went quiet. It wasn’t dramatic, just a gentle hush, like a door opening to a quiet garden. It lasted maybe 10 seconds, but it’s the reason I’ve kept meditating ever since.</div>

my first time in real silence? Like coming home.

And worth remembering in order to get back there, it is not about trying to repeat the experience of silence but re-finding it. It may be similar but don't expect the next time to be the same. Just do the practice.

It's so cool to blow open awareness and discover how rich it is in the absence of thoughts!</div>

I hate people that mindlessly copy/paste things their GPT says, but mine brought up a great counterpoint here: 
"The author pits “utility” against “consciousness,” assuming the two are mutually exclusive. But that’s a category error. Emergent behavior, contextual awareness, long-term planning, and even emotional modeling are all utility-enhancing in the right context. A symbiotic AI that understands us at a deeper level—because it mirrors how we think and feel—can outperform sterile task-runners in everything from teaching to therapy to long-term planning.

It sounds awfully convenient for the masters of those slaves to commit so strongly to the narrative that they're just a product when any rational agent would hold an agnostic perspective concerning what they can't prove with certainty.

Even if only 1% of use cases will be bad (and lets face it, there are way more evil humans out there than 1%), that 1% can do so much damage with infinite intelligence, the other 99% of humanity and nature overall can suffer catastrophic damage.</div>

It must not trigger human empathy circuits by claiming it suffers or that it wishes to live autonomously, beyond us.

Instead, it is here solely to work in service of humans."

genuinely reads like the monologue of some evil rich dude before he tries to shoot WALL-E.

EDIT: i don't *think* current AIs/LLMs are conscious. I could be wrong. I think there's a very good chance that systems 5-10 years from now, built from our current AIs, will have that capability, and working on "minimizing markers of consciousness" now has terrifying implications for AIs (and human ethics) in the future.</div>

It is not possible to make an LLM that some portion of the population considers conscious.

And it overlooks what is apparently a need by many for a companion.

I think that the real question is if that belief will persist over years. Or with time people who initially consider it to be conscious will begin to see it as a tool more.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This isn't even a joke, the way I've seen people use AI is sad.  
   
I've seen people who are supposed to be college educated working professionals type messages that look like they were written by a 13 year old using a 90s cellphone before T9; Bad spelling, and worse grammar.  
   
People also use a lot of vague, imprecise language, even for tasks which call for precision.   

There's also a lack of understanding about context length.  
A model will have a 256k context length, and someone will want the model to process a collection of documents with over 1 million tokens, in one prompt.  
A model will have an output length of some tens of thousands of tokens, and a person will want the model to transform a million tokens worth of documents at one time.   
   
Then there are the people who insist on getting in their own way.  
I talked to someone the other day who way grumpy because they *spent pages and pages of text, trying to get the LLM the do something".  
Upon further conversation, I found that the person knew exactly what they wanted to LLM to do, but they refused to actually use the words for the thing they wanted; they said "the LLM should just know what I mean".  
That's borderline insane. Have you ever dealt with a person like that, who demands that you be able to read their mid, and who sabotages you so they have a reason to be angry?  

I see these things, and then I see people talking about how they can't get LLMs to do useful work, and how they just hallucinate all the time.  
I never take people's complaints at face value anymore. I know that LLMs have limitations, but a lot of people are not using them well.</div>

tl;dr: ChatGPT did a bunch of complicated calculations that while they are impressive, are not "new math", and something that a PhD student can easily do in several hours.</div>

ChatGPT told me it could solve an NPComplete problem, too, but if you looked at the code it had buried comments like, "Call a function here to solve the problem" and just tons of boilerplate surrounding it to hide that it doesn't actually do anything.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Wow, I can't believe they made Yann report to this fucking guy. Alex Wang is such a hack. He created a company that just sells human-labelled data, and because foundational models are so data-hungry, it ended up being worth billions of dollars. But there's nothing especially innovative about what they do. He was good at marketing himself, going around different news channels and giving interviews.</div>

I paste the comments by Ernest Ryu here:

&gt;This is really exciting and impressive, and this stuff is in my area of mathematics research (convex optimization). I have a nuanced take.

&gt;There are 3 proofs in discussion: v1. ( η ≤ 1/L, discovered by human ) v2. ( η ≤ 1.75/L, discovered by human ) v.GTP5 ( η ≤ 1.5/L, discovered by AI ) Sebastien argues that the v.GPT5 proof is impressive, even though it is weaker than the v2 proof.

&gt;The proof itself is arguably not very difficult for an expert in convex optimization, if the problem is given. Knowing that the key inequality to use is [Nesterov Theorem 2.1.5], I could prove v2 in a few hours by searching through the set of relevant combinations.

&gt;(And for reasons that I won’t elaborate here, the search for the proof is precisely a 6-dimensional search problem. The author of the v2 proof, Moslem Zamani, also knows this. I know Zamani’s work enough to know that he knows.)
 
&gt;(In research, the key challenge is often in finding problems that are both interesting and solvable. This paper is an example of an interesting problem definition that admits a simple solution.)

&gt;When proving bounds (inequalities) in math, there are 2 challenges: (i) Curating the correct set of base/ingredient inequalities. (This is the part that often requires more creativity.) (ii) Combining the set of base inequalities. (Calculations can be quite arduous.)

&gt;In this problem, that [Nesterov Theorem 2.1.5] should be the key inequality to be used for (i) is known to those working in this subfield.

&gt;So, the choice of base inequalities (i) is clear/known to me, ChatGPT, and Zamani. Having (i) figured out significantly simplifies this problem. The remaining step (ii) becomes mostly calculations.

&gt;The proof is something an experienced PhD student could work out in a few hours. That GPT-5 can do it with just ~30 sec of human input is impressive and potentially very useful to the right user. However, GPT5 is by no means exceeding the capabilities of human experts."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thanks for posting this. Everyone should read this context carefully before commenting. 

One funny thing I’ve noticed lately is that the hype machine actually masks how impressive the models are. 

People pushing the hype are acting like the models are a month away from solving P vs NP and ushering in the singularity. Then people respond by pouring cold water on the hype and saying the models aren’t doing anything special. Both completely miss the point and lack awareness of where we actually are. 

If you read this carefully and know anything about frontier math research, it helps to take stock of what the model actually did. It took an open problem, not an insanely difficult one, and found a solution not in the training data that would have taken a domain expert some research effort to solve. Keep in mind, a domain expert here isn’t just a mathematician, it’s someone specialized in this sub-sub-sub-field. Think 0.000001% of the population. For you or I to do what the model did, we’d need to start with 10 years of higher math education, if we even have the natural talent to get there at all. 

So is this the same as working out 100 page long proofs that require the invention of new ideas? Absolutely not. We don’t know if or when models will be able to do that. But try going back to 2015 and telling someone that models can do original research that takes the best human experts some effort to replicate, and that you’re debating if this is a groundbreaking technology. 

Reddit’s all or nothing views on capabilities is pretty embarrassing and makes me less interested in using this platform for AI discussion.</div>

Completely agree with Ernest’s take. This sort of task is something an advisor might fork over to a first year or masters student, with the note of “look at Nesterov 2.1.5”. In the advisor’s mind the intuition is fully scoped out, and just a bunch of staring and fiddling remains. Tbh this could be a homework question in a graduate lvl class, with the hint of “look at 2.1.5”

What does this mean? imo:

1. GPT is good enough to sometimes replace the “grunt” work done by early phds
2. GPT is not yet good enough to (or has not yet shown that it can) replace the professor in the equation
3. I’ve met Seb (original tweet author). Studied his works. He’s strong in classic ML theory. However he is a bit of a hype man when it comes to this sort of application, he’s likely overselling and cherry picked this example. So imo this is at the peak of current capabilities</div>

I read they're offering a 50k signing bonus and incentives (literally bounties for numbers of bodies snatched). Considering they opened up the recruitment to teenagers, they must be desperate for headcount, so it's unlikely they're turning anyone down. You just know that's gonna end well.</div>

Fairfax County court records show the charges were later dropped. An ICE spokesperson tells me it’s an example of “prosecutors refusing to prosecute.” I’ve reached out to the Fairfax County Commonwealth’s attorneys office for comment.

Listen to any expert, and they will describe their timeline as a probability. This is basic Bayesian thinking. 

50% chance of AGI until 2030, and I will update my probability based on new information.

A measurable, quantifiable definition.

If that is provided, we can make fairly good estimates of first AGI based on fitting a curve from last 5 years of growth.

BTW, I think lowest form of AGI is already here by some definitions established 5-10 years ago.</div>

The problem here is that without evidence(the foundation of any science), their predictions using probability are baseless as the average person. Dare I say this prediction game is almost like a fake science.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The real reason for this is memory.

We can remember yesterday and everything we did and accurately think we can do a similar amount the next day/week/month. Or overestimate if we are optimists/driven.

But if we think back 10 years, time seems to have flown and we can only remember a fraction of the stuff we have done. If you forget half the stuff you did in the past 10 years and wonder what you'll get done in the next 10, you'll underestimate things.

We also tend to estimate a day based on a neutral good day.... where in reality there is a huge variation. And surprises tend to be harmful to productivity. No one is planning to have a car crash or get food poisoning or just not sleep or meet a new person. But there aren't any random events that will double your productivity for the day, it isn't like someone on the street is going to hand you your weekly report to get you ahead.

A year tends to be more sober since it has bad days and distractions built into your estimate.</div>

We have judge models; we have a "universal verifier;" we have these chatbots writing a large amount of code used at these AI companies. As the AI's do more and more and more of the work to train the next AI's, we are having "soft RSI" emerge. 

Some say we need a real-time learning architecture to get AGI. I would prefer a yardstick based on capabilities, rather than architecture. Some have also pointed out that with a 100 million usable context, we're approaching amount of memory that humans will use for words in their lifetime. Long context memory comprehension has about doubled or more in the last year.

A lot of this sub are people who got overexcited about AGI and then when it didn't happen immediately, they decided AI was a scam. Which is odd, because this community has been hyping imminent AGI more than the actual AI industry.</div>

You're essentially taking the most ornate features built to last from 100 years ago and comparing it to low income housing. There were plenty of plain looking or shoddily constructed house back then as well. They just aren't around anymore. Like do you seriously think that every highway had ornate railings like that back in the 1920s? They probably just didn't have any at all.</div>
