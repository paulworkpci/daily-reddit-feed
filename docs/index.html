I had a relative who developed blader cancer, and they used a genetically modified version of tuberculosis to kill the cancer cells. No chemotherapy, just surgery and modified bacteria solution inserted into his bladder. No major side effects, although he was kind of sick for a while.</div>

A car you may just need in order to survive in the US. Public transit is nigh on non-existant and with the US being built for drivers, your only other option is to just... starve? Like, those same people who complain about AI are probably also r/fuckcars enjoyers.

Just looking at the arguments against AI, I don't see any complaints about researchers using it for medical breakthroughs or using it to make more efficient use of energy in other sectors. I really only see complaints about people using it for people generating slop content or for manipulating online discourse or harvesting personal data.

This kinda reads like that meme where someone complains about being a peasant and someone pops out of the well and says, "yet you participate in society!" 

Just my 2 cents.</div>

Looked up homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants by country as a conduit for “gangland killing” whatever that is.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate

Sweden is number 144 on this list of 204 with 1.1 homicide per 100,000 inhabitants. stat is from 2023. 

US is number 66, with 5.7 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. 

For the record, there are PLENTY of European countries ahead of Sweden on this list (i.e. higher rates of intentional homicide) but the only European country I see above the US on this list is Russia… the bastion of Muslim/MENA immigration lol. 

What point was Maher even trying to make? Why Sweden? Why “gangland” violence?

Immigration is up all around Western Europe and has been since even earlier than 2010, yet homicide is WAY lower than anywhere else in the world which has far less immigration.</div>

Currently you have 

- new hyundais from participating dealers

- used hyundais from hyundai dealers

- all of hertz pre-owned lineup, picked up from hertz car sales

I do dislike that you have to pickup at hertz instead of getting prime two-day delivery or something, likewise weird to me there are several listings for the same hyundai, one from each dealer, all with their own terrible photoshopped thumbnails, I wish they would abstract that further</div>

At this point it’s a wash, since the average person treats their car just as badly as a rental. At least you know Hertz changed the oil once in the last 40,000 miles.</div>

Every light it's a race, cold starts and run hard, cheap oil, nobody to care about checking out that 'new sound" the car makes.  And of course that makes sense, it's "not their problem" so issues are neglected.

So it's more they got lucky that the 3/4 truck runs great despite it's history.  You can guarantee someone treated it like garbage and a few great cars that don't show the mistreatment does not change the fact you take a risk buying a rental.  Always has been that way, always will be that way.</div>

&gt;the rental car company Hertz falsely accused hundreds of innocent customers of stealing its vehicles — accusations that, for some customers, resulted in arrests, felony charges and jail time.

Lawyer and Youtuber Steve Leto reports on people getting arrested for using a Hertz car literally every month. Fuck Hertz.</div>

I mean think about it. If our foot gets stuck on something, we can feel it with our skin and adjust our movement accordingly.  
These robots don't have that kid of information because they don't have touch sensors like we do in our skin.
This demo relies purely on input from the gyros and resistance from the motors to navigate their environment.  
This makes it way more impressive. But also explains why it just plows through the objects lol</div>

This is the exact way you speak to customers when you’ve been doing calls for too long - a weird autopilot with ums and ahs to buy you thinking time while sounding ‘professional’.

I’m not sure why anyone would want to spend their free time talking to a customer service simulator, but it’s likely the most ‘conversational’ data OpenAI could get their hands on.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This isn't even a joke, the way I've seen people use AI is sad.  
   
I've seen people who are supposed to be college educated working professionals type messages that look like they were written by a 13 year old using a 90s cellphone before T9; Bad spelling, and worse grammar.  
   
People also use a lot of vague, imprecise language, even for tasks which call for precision.   

There's also a lack of understanding about context length.  
A model will have a 256k context length, and someone will want the model to process a collection of documents with over 1 million tokens, in one prompt.  
A model will have an output length of some tens of thousands of tokens, and a person will want the model to transform a million tokens worth of documents at one time.   
   
Then there are the people who insist on getting in their own way.  
I talked to someone the other day who way grumpy because they *spent pages and pages of text, trying to get the LLM the do something".  
Upon further conversation, I found that the person knew exactly what they wanted to LLM to do, but they refused to actually use the words for the thing they wanted; they said "the LLM should just know what I mean".  
That's borderline insane. Have you ever dealt with a person like that, who demands that you be able to read their mid, and who sabotages you so they have a reason to be angry?  

I see these things, and then I see people talking about how they can't get LLMs to do useful work, and how they just hallucinate all the time.  
I never take people's complaints at face value anymore. I know that LLMs have limitations, but a lot of people are not using them well.</div>

It’s shocking the prompts some people use. Almost every time someone says the model is failing at a simple task, their prompt is ludicrously underspecified. Of course it can’t read their mind lmao. 

That said, I do think they could tune the models to inquire more when someone is being a dumbass. If you prompt it with something way too vague to ever get a meaningful response, it should inquire about what the heck you’re trying to describe instead of just guessing. 

But seriously, reading other people’s prompts will make you lose all faith in some people’s ability to use tools in their work.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I hope they do. Grok is and it's sweeping the huge market no one else is tapping into. When the android version comes out it's going to blow up completely. They kind of need competition, and out of the rest the only one I can see trying to take the piece of that, admittedly creamy, pie would be Meta. Competition is good, we don't really want any of them getting full control of the market.</div>

When he turns around and the environment suddenly morphs into a city that feels exactly like some dream shit.

That said, it would make for an interesting video game mechanic, where the world spaces out of view of the camera are being generated dynamically, so you’d be navigating and needing to focus on your tracks in order to backtrack, leading to a unique experience every time.  No idea what the goal or mission structure would look like though</div>

The lack of cohesion in the environment, along with how things shift and morph to closely resemble what’s in frame is no exaggeration exactly how the beginning of a lucid dream looks.

Right now, the 6 of Anthropic's models are all in the top 10. In my experience, I haven't found GPT-5 to be clearly better at frontend tasks then Sonnet 4 or I've found it to be personally worse than Opus.

Disclaimer: i am experimenting 

But there was an issue with the code, and i experimented with 4 different models 

Soonset 3.5, Soonset 3.7 and GPT 5 Preview kept going in loops fixing the issue with no results 

Soonset 4 lastly introduced to the code and everything was fixed in the first attempt 

And yes I totally agree, when I made ChatGPT write the prompts for Soonset 4 .. well let's just say I was blown away by the results 

Are AI agents perfect? Of course not 

But that doesn't mean they are not getting there 

I am close to finishing up a tool that has an algorithm and a logical flow in 5 days and I don't have any experience with coding. But, I can understand the language a bit and I certainly can help agents pinpoint the problems and how they should fix it and they do fix it. 

If their "AI agents" progress kept on the same track, they will reach perfection within 5 years conservatively I suspect 

From your experience, what do you think? Will they ever reach perfection? When?</div>

I honestly get terrible results from opus 4.1 and I know it is user error. I am a software engineer by trade so I get technical and it still barfs or does not understand. 

However GPT-5 thinking seems to understand my prompt language much better and the code from it is decent. I also have no issues with opus 4 and sonnet. Opus 4.1 I just burn tokens (by restarting tasks that it/I messed up). </div>

It's not a full response it like 

"A"

Just 1 letter.
If your optimization actually worked cursor would return 


"A"

As it's full response, or, more realistically it would auto fail because the reasoning and toolcall to even read your method actually eats tokens too. 

-

And you can't "instill an understanding of bugs by using typos" you do not train the model. Nothing you do ever trains the model. 

Every time you talk the the ai A fresh instance of the ai is created and your chat messages and a little ai summary is poured into it as "context"

After that it forgets everything, it does not learn. The only time it learns is when openai/X/deep learn decides to run the training loops and release a new model.</div>

Saying “I see how much work you put into this” can mean more than “Great job” because it values the process, not just the outcome. People remember when you make them feel seen for trying, and it builds trust and deeper connections over time.</div>

Works wonders for better compliments to give anyone! But especially children too. 

I’m about to absolutely butcher my explanation and examples off the top of my head here because I’m on my phone and distracted but it’s something I feel very strongly about so I hope it at least gives someone a good starting point. 

Instead of “you ARE x” —&gt; “You DO x”

Instead of “you are smart” —&gt; “you studied well/your practice paid off”

Instead of “you are so athletic” —&gt; “I can tell you love x sport; you put in so much dedicated effort to (perform x maneuver/skill) well “ 


It reinforces their enthusiasm for efforts into activities they have control over. Versus traits they don’t . and that gives them better resilience to working towards goals vs. being prone to self doubt and sabotage if they’re not inherently successful at the thing they wanted.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah that's cool. I can kinda see that working better on me at least.
 The last bit reminds me of a study I heard talked about where they gave kids puzzles and praised some for being smart and others for being hard working and offered them a harder problem to try, they found those that were praised for their hard work were more likely to try the harder problem and less quick to give up on it.
That was just something I heard in a video essay though, I can't say for sure whether it really exists or not.
I'll come back with an update if I find it.</div>

One thing that helped me a ton was drilling them once a week at first. With the multi-step kipping patterns, reinforcement helps a ton with muscle memory. Doesn't have to be much, maybe some kipping swings, hips to bar, and a few singles. 


Lots of people say this, but it's very true. Consistency is critical to breaking that "do I have them today?" curse. </div>

                <div class="post-content">A few weeks ago I started doing a mini meditation (like 60 seconds of guided meditation, watching the breath, etc) before I open social media. It’s a small thing, but it’s made me see my habits really differently.

**My approach:** 

* Open social media mindlessly (I keep it blocked)
* I force myself to do a mini meditation
* After that I can unblock it if I want to, but only for 5-15 minutes

**The result:** 

* About half the times I reach for social media, I end up not even opening it anymore...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Fair question. I use an app (Roots) to enforce the rules.   
  
It has a guided meditation built into it (also some breathing exercises and stuff)... I tried a version of this with iOS screen time but it was too easy to ignore the rules. You could probably set up something similar on any screen time app but not sure if others have the meditation stuff built into it.</div>

I like how you use it for small times. Like, letting yourself have it in moderation. I was kind of a person who grew up thinking things were either one thing or another ("black" or "white") mentally, so learning moderation has been pretty interesting.

Listen to any expert, and they will describe their timeline as a probability. This is basic Bayesian thinking. 

50% chance of AGI until 2030, and I will update my probability based on new information.

A measurable, quantifiable definition.

If that is provided, we can make fairly good estimates of first AGI based on fitting a curve from last 5 years of growth.

BTW, I think lowest form of AGI is already here by some definitions established 5-10 years ago.</div>

The problem here is that without evidence(the foundation of any science), their predictions using probability are baseless as the average person. Dare I say this prediction game is almost like a fake science.</div>

And at the same time, 1 year sounds long but we all get to experience how short it actually is the older we get, so it's easy to overestimate yourself at first (also holy, it's almost september)

                                <div class="reply-body">The real reason for this is memory.

We can remember yesterday and everything we did and accurately think we can do a similar amount the next day/week/month. Or overestimate if we are optimists/driven.

But if we think back 10 years, time seems to have flown and we can only remember a fraction of the stuff we have done. If you forget half the stuff you did in the past 10 years and wonder what you'll get done in the next 10, you'll underestimate things.

We also tend to estimate a day based on a neutral good day.... where in reality there is a huge variation. And surprises tend to be harmful to productivity. No one is planning to have a car crash or get food poisoning or just not sleep or meet a new person. But there aren't any random events that will double your productivity for the day, it isn't like someone on the street is going to hand you your weekly report to get you ahead.

A year tends to be more sober since it has bad days and distractions built into your estimate.</div>
