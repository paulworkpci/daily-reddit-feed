Since Charlie started the org and become rich, Arizona Democrats won a Senate seat, the Governorship, the Secretary of State's office, the Attorney General's office, and the other Senate seat.

If you ever want to be rich but are scared that you're too dumb to do it, become a conservative organizer and political commentator.</div>

Not only would there be a danger of extra administrative work but a lot of times taking on these responsibilities as a woman is seen as being less capable and thus being judged as less promotion worthy. Especially in tech or engineering. The articles about this phenomenon call this type of work "glue work". While glue work might be seen as impressive and taking leadership and responsibility as a man, it is not likely to be seen the same way when a woman does it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Great point. i can see it becoming very easy to move from being a facilitator for collaboration to simply someone taking dictation from higher ups who don't have a budget for administrative staff. When I've seen this happen, it's invariably a woman. 

Definitely one of those things that, as a man,  I don't think about as actively as I should, but as soon as someone says it you think "oh man, that does happen a lot".</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is a hugely important distinction. I used to drive almost all meetings and leaders would view it as an admin task - essentially taking notes for the "more important people" who participated (even though I'm a lawyer did a lot of heavy lifting in those meetings.) And when you volunteer to do this, it often ends with additional work of cleaning up the final notes and following up with the team post-meeting, which in some contexts can become more unrecognized admin work. Be very strategic about this.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body"> Chat GPT rundown on the issue:

Patent quantity alone is an imperfect measure of technological progress for several reasons:

1. Patent quality varies significantly. Many Chinese patents are utility models or design patents, which face less rigorous examination than invention patents typical in the US system.

2. Patent incentives differ between countries. China has strong government incentives for patent filing, including subsidies, tax benefits, and career advancement for researchers based on patent counts.

3. Patent enforcement and value differ. The US has a more established system for monetizing and enforcing patents, potentially making each patent more commercially valuable.

4. Innovation ecosystems involve more than patents. Factors like venture capital availability, research commercialization infrastructure, and university-industry collaboration significantly impact technological advancement.

5. Domain leadership varies. While China leads in certain areas like telecommunications and digital payments, the US maintains advantages in areas like biotechnology, semiconductors, and enterprise software.

A more comprehensive assessment of technological advancement would consider factors like:
- R&amp;D investment effectiveness
- Scientific publication impact
- New product commercialization rates
- Industry-specific technological breakthroughs

Of course they will have a hard time ever offloading this investment, but that's a problem for the future. For now they get to claim that their investment appreciated.

Same thing happened with xAI buying Twitter.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s not a public company. It’s all private investors. Also xAI accomplished a lot with relatively little resources and time.

They, like everyone else in the frontier AI space, are shooting for AGI/ASI. Once that is achieved the cost to get there matters not.

Elon’s companies are at the frontier of AI, EVs, Space Travel, brain interface, autonomous driving, and autonomous robots. Of course private investors would like a piece of that, imagine the mind blowing scenario if all his companies actually achieve what they want and have synergy together. It’s basically the Singularity.</div>

I'd keep it if I still had my "[track-home away from home](https://i.imgur.com/27S3PdJ.jpg)" but I sold that in 2022 for a pretty good profit when the trailer market was insane.  
  
Can't decide on what I want. I had an Acura TL before the truck, but the height/[capability](https://i.imgur.com/aBYuRgP.jpg) spoiled me... my "wants" are all over the place; Ramcharger, Supra, TLX, Tahoe, Ioniq 5N, and a few others.   
  
But my truck is paid off and even with my 850 FICO, interest is 5-6% via credit union.  With prices going the way they are, it's just not a reasonable time for me to give up the comfort of no car payment.</div>

Lately I have been integrating AI services into my workflow and I agree with you. AI can be a good coder, but it can hardly have an overview of the system. Surely in the future that won't be a problem, but right now it is.

Out of curiosity, what stack do you use to build your games?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My initial letterlinks game with claude code was built in vanilla JS... Because the game sort of evolved organically and I was so new to the tool, I didn't really think to stop and ask it to refactor every so often, so I ended up with a couple of absolutely massive files that even Claude itself began to struggle with.

Gridagram uses react and typescript. I also made sure to learn from my previous mistake, and every time I hit a progress point that I was happy with, I asked Gemini to pause and consider opportunities for refactoring/streamlining the codebase.

I'm not a coder so I can't really say for sure how much cleaner the codebase is, but it seems a lot more modular. I also just asked Gemini for refactoring opportunities (it's been a while), and here's a tldr of what it came back with (the full post wouldn't fit in the comment):

Good:

* Code is split into components (LetterGrid, WordList, etc.).

* Complex logic is nicely separated into custom Hooks (useGameState, useLetterSelection).

* Using TypeScript and CSS Modules is good practice.

Needs Improvement / Refactoring Ideas:

* App.tsx is quite large and passes many props down to other components (prop drilling).

* State isn't truly centralized, making it harder to manage as the app grows.

* Tutorial logic is mixed directly into App.tsx, making it complex.

TLDR Suggestion:Consider using React Context (or a lightweight state library like Zustand) to manage the main game state. This would simplify App.tsx and make state easier to access everywhere without passing props down multiple levels.</div>

Allow thoughts in the background and put your breath and body in the foreground.

Trying to stop thoughts just gives your thoughts more power over you!

Find enjoyment in how you can soothe your nervous system by using your breath to soothe your heart.

Play around with longer exhales that’ll send waves of pleasure through your heart.

Get so engrossed in your breath and body that you stop having thought...</div>

Even if one isnt trying to stop thoughts, the usual instruction is to observe breath and if a thought happens and you notice yourself, gently bring focus back to breath. 

While this is good advice it sorta implies there’s no thought when observing breath when in fact thoughts can come n go but in the background while breath focus occupies the foreground.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yea.  I think the “bring attention back to the breath” is understood by intermediate and above meditators, but I think beginners think that having a thought means they aren’t doing it right and that they have to get away from thoughts.

Having thoughts in the background feels different to me as I don’t see having thoughts as meaning I’m not doing it right.  If I lose my focus on my breath, then I bring it back, but having thoughts in the background is fine.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I used to think the whole point of meditation was to stop thinking completely, and it honestly made me feel like I was failing at it. I’d sit down, close my eyes, and then five seconds later my mind would be spinning with to-do lists, old memories, random stuff. I’d get frustrated and just give up thinking maybe meditation just wasn’t for me. It wasn’t until someone told me it’s not about stopping thoughts, but just noticing them, that things actually started to shift for me.

Now I treat it more like watching cars pass on a street. I sit, I breathe, and when thoughts come up, I try not to chase them or push them away, just see them and let them move on. Some days it works better than others, but letting go of the idea that my mind had to be totally blank made it way more calming. I still have a long way to go with it but it finally feels like something I can actually stick with.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Mostly the other people are extremely motivating. However, the egoistic people stick together and do make a Newby feel uninvited and insecure. That's only my opinion from my experience. So my solution was to join the "seniors" workoutgroup (I was only 28 yrs old) knowing that I was making friends with the parents of the rude members. Also, when everyone learned I was owner of this gym w/ my husband, all of a sudden I was treated with ultimate kindness. I also felt great knowing their parents and details of their grown a** children.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I recently joined too. You need to be in the mindset of being willing to ask lots of questions and ask the coaches for help. At my gym, anytime the coach didn’t recognize me since I was new, they came to introduce themselves and ask about my fitness background so they’d know how much help I was going to need. Something else helpful that i discovered recently is that my gym posts the workouts on an app. If I look at the workouts ahead of time I can mentally prepare or watch videos of movements I’m not familiar with so I have it in my head in advance. You could ask the gym if they do something similar. Also, after I joined, other people joined too. So I’m not even usually the least experienced one in the room. And even when I am, it’s okay! Nobody cares, they are thinking about themselves and how tired they are, not judging me!</div>

Then think you are going to take that long again, plus more, to reach the end of your life.

I'm almost halfway through a 90-year lifespan. When I think about all I've done and experienced, and how long it took to get this far, then think that I get to do it all over again to reach the end, I think "Yeah, that seems fair."</div>

About 10 years ago, I made and printed this poster for myself. Each row stands for a year, with 52 boxes, and there are 77 rows in total (average life expectancy in Germany). It’s been a huge help in keeping me motivated. By now, it’s become a habit to fill in one box with a marker every Saturday.

Last week, I turned 39. The marked box next year represents a milestone: the end of my apprenticeship.</div>

Using this tech in work meetings, sales calls, interviews, etc is far more practical and less objectionable. But using it in the context of a date is controversial for obvious reasons -&gt; good engagement bait. Saw so many quote tweets blasting this and giving it more publicity

e: Somebody posted a tweet saying that dates arent actually a use case for the product so yep lol confirmed.</div>
