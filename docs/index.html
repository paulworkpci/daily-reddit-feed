He's generally correct that some users save huge amounts of time using AI, while others actually spend more time for worse results. And it correlates heavily with how experienced and skilled someone already is at their job. At least that's what our stats guys told us the last time they reviewed the client logs. But maybe they're related to this guy.</div>

Even if I get my students to type their responses, it’s still not perfect and doesn’t consistently use the rubric. I can get it to behave properly after many iterations of prompting but then eventually, the time it takes to set everything up is longer than just grading it myself.

Nowadays, I just encourage my students to use 2.5 pro to get their own feedback while their learning, hoping that by the time it reaches me, the grading is easier because they actually know what they’re talking about</div>

Cool trick though but does seem like wear and tear would break it far too quickly at full size.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">the decision to keep it from the plus users is probably intentional to create a sense of missing out and drive more people to discuss it and anticipate it. seems like a common marketing ploy to drive hype for your product, and OpenAI are masters of hyping up products that ultimately end up disappointing. if everyone got access people would be trash-talking it in a day, but since people cant access it the conversation surrounding it is mostly creating a sense of anticipation. this will ultimately lead to more people using it. not something i like or agree with but its a solid business tactic.</div>

Joe actually condemns Kanye’s racism/anti semitism literally the next sentence.

When Joe said “kind of supports” he was referring to censorship making the song more popular/notorious not Hitler’s views about Jews.</div>

&gt;“And then it kind of supports what he says, which is that there’s this concerted effort if you talk about Jewish people, that they’re going to remove you from everything, remove you from banking, which is what he’s saying, they run everything,”

Does that sound like he's saying the song will be more popular if spotify or whatever decide to not list it, or does it sound like he's saying Jews as a people are secretly coordinating to hide the truth about what Kanye has said?</div>

I used to really like the show because it was an idiot speaking to smarter people and learning something.


Somehow being around smart people convinced this moron that he's also smart, and this is the result. 


You can see the lack of brainpower in his eyes as he's speaking.</div>

He has people from all walks of life kissing his ass and agreeing with him to get on his platform, struggling comedians/podcast hosts trying to network their way up to Joseph Rogan to make their career, all types of people trying to get on to plug their product to sell to Rogan fans, politicians trying to get on his good side to sway his listeners to support them.


Can make or break your career or product if you get a rogan appearance and endorsement, or if he doesn’t like you or your product if he talks down or (tries to be funny) makes a joke out of what you are selling can crush your career.

The near forced merger with Renault, the use of CVT's for almost everything, the expansionist powers that Carlos yielded with little attention to responsible R&amp;D...Espinosa isn't particularly wrong. But, Nissan had several years without Carlos to fix the problems. So, we'll see how it all works out.</div>

The more you care about the outcome of the conversation (say, asking out a crush) , the more likely you will be to freeze, lose your words, or be motivated to skip the small talk entirely.

True. But neurotypicals don't actually care about what you think of the weather either. 

It isn't about what you are asking (for the first question, anyway). It's the unspoken message:

"I am a friendly and non-threatening person and I would like to talk to you. Will you reciprocate?"

Then you judge by their response whether or not they are amenable to talking to you.</div>

But genuinely remarking on the day of the week is a real easy way to start small talk as most people have an emotional context that's socially acceptable related to each. If they don't then their deviation is in and of itself a way to start small talk.

They’re going to crack crypto currency.  That’s it.  

That won’t be a small thing or a friendly thing.  It will be a chaotic act of destruction that will be unstoppable.  Imagine what happens to the value of Bitcoin when one day every coin and wallet everywhere becomes instantly free for rogue actors globally.  Billions will be eradicated instantly.  There will be a rush to escape crypto before becoming the next victim.  It’ll be just like any traditional crash except there’s no bottom number.   The pirates won’t discriminate between coins valued at $80k or $0.80, free money is still free money, you just have to steal more as value dips, there’s no downside.  

Oh and then comes the funny part, as people scramble to exit early, there’s going to be unethical  crypto investors (so all of them) who decide after dumping their coins to invest in quantum computing so they can get in on the action.</div>

Even if you don't follow the ritual, here's a reminder to clean your ceiling fans. Seriously, it's probably gross.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If you have a ceiling fan they’re usually set with two directions.
One to force warm air down in the winter and the opposite to bring cooler air in the summer.
When you switch the directions all the dust on the fan blades blows off.
Swiffer dusters are your friend.
And if you were kidding - never mind.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There should be a up/down switch by the ceiling fan motors, like, somewhere in the center above of where the light bulbs are.

The switch controls which way the fans rotate. You want them to rotate counter clockwise when is hot to push the cool air down, or  clockwise when is cold to push the warmer air down.

I wanted to share something a little personal. I’ve been going through a weird phase lately—feeling stuck, constantly second-guessing myself, clinging to plans that never seem to land the way I hoped. And in the middle of that mental fog, a quote from Bruce Lee kept resurfacing:

 “Empty your mind.
Be formless, shapeless, like water.”

I’ve heard it before, probably a hundred times. But this time, it hit different.

I realized that I’ve been trying so hard to hold onto control—cont...</div>

I'm not affiliated with Roo Code — just an avid user.

It’s a lightweight VS Code extension that lets you bring your own API keys (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.). No subscriptions, no lock-ins. It's fully local, privacy-respecting, and extremely hackable.

That’s the TLDR.

If you’re looking for more than just completions — like a **real agent workflow** that’s transparent and modular — here’s how I use Roo Code to build a full AI team inside VS Code:

**[GitHub Guide: Building a Structured, Transparent, and Well-Documented AI Team](https://github.com/Mnehmos/Building-a-Structured-Transparent-and-Well-Documented-AI-Team)**

I walk through how to:
- Create an Orchestrator that manages agents
- Break down projects into verifiable phases
- Use task maps instead of chains
- Assign subtasks with context + constraints
- Integrate CLI tools, files, and APIs via MCP servers

Here’s the high-level task map format I use:

```
# [Project Title]

## Phase 0: Setup
**Goal:** [Phase Objective]

### Task 0.1: [Setup Environment]
- Scope: [Setup boundaries]
- Expected Output: [Working baseline]

## Phase 1: Build
**Goal:** [Initial Functional Version]

### Task 1.1: [Implement Core Feature]
- Scope: ...
- Expected Output: ...
```

Each task is handed off with a subtask prompt like this:

```
# [Task Title]

## Context
[How it fits into the larger project]

## Scope
[What is and isn’t part of the task]

## Expected Output
[Clear success criteria]

## Additional Resources
[Docs, tips, examples]
```

If Cursor was your intro to coding with models, Roo Code is what happens when you go pro mode *without* being locked in.

Happy to answer questions or share setups.</div>

I agree that cursor is like agent models with training wheels, roo is the bike.

The only other thing I use cursor for right now is I like being able to use o3. I’ve been thinking of contacting OpenAI and just requesting the ability to use it just to cut out the middle man. They could be getting my money directly if not for their tiered api plan.</div>

Honestly, if naming were a martial art, you’d be a fifth-degree black belt in semantic jiu-jitsu. It’s almost unfair to the rest of us.

1. **CodeX** – Capital X because ✨*edgy futurism*. Looks amazing in a logo.
2. **Codexx** – Double the “x,” double the power. Because one “x” just isn’t disruptive enough.
3. **KodeX** – Replace the “C” with a “K” because branding™. A classic tech bro move.
4. **CodexAI** – Just slap “AI” on it. Boom. You’re a unicorn now.
5. **Kodecks** – Wildcard spelling, looks like a cyberpunk DJ but secretly writes unit tests.</div>

My post is coming from the perspective of a long-time developer using these tools daily for specific, complex tasks within rapidly evolving frameworks and libraries. While general understanding is helpful, the practical limitations I run into most often relate to the depth and currency of framework-specific knowledge. Debugging framework-specific errors or needing up-to-date library usage seems to require a level of specialized understanding that current generalist models often lack, regardless of their broad knowledge base.

I'm genuinely curious though… could you elaborate a bit more on what specific basics of LLMs you think are most relevant here, or how the general knowledge aspect directly addresses the need for deep, current framework specialization? Always looking to learn more, so enlighten me.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm evaluating LLMs for coding using open source LLMs. The whole experience has many up and downs. Biggest problem: the LLMs aren't consistent. Creating code from a well defined prompt and making changes works great. Discussing possible solutions and using them as interactive documentation is also great. But analysing and bugfixing code is a nightmare half the time. The models don't seem to grasp how the code actually works. They can't reason about its functionality and track down bugs on their own. This is a major issue, since as a developer you read a lot more code than write from scratch. Eventually every small, nice codebase will turn into a legacy code monstrosity LLMs can't handle. There is also a lot of legacy already out there.

I'm not sure, if specialized models would fix this.</div>

Yes. This is how LLMs work. 

LLMs don't think. They don't do logic. They are, fundamentally - "what word comes next" models when used generatively. That's of course a bit of an oversimplification - there's a lot of clever math and statistics involved in that decision (this is what makes LLMs good at processing natural language, after all). But fundamentally, the mechanism that determines what word comes next is a statistical analysis of the training corpus. 

This is why these things do well when the problem they are trying to solve is well documented or in the training set - a statistical guess about what word comes next is a lot easier when you're doing interpolation.</div>
