                        <div class="comment-body">nano banana is on another level for consistency. From my tests, SeedDream relies on a text description of the reference image by an llm, nano banana imports the image natively. If you ask nano banana to change the expression of a human, you will get that same exact human with the new expression. I have not seen this in SeedDream.</div>

For example, if they say "hey, I really feel like the decisions you're making are impacting the family in a negative way and we should work together to help you find a way to make better choices", you can paraphrase that back by saying something like "oh, so you're saying I'm just a giant idiot and everyone hates me?"

Really helps keep the argument on track.</div>

And the point should not just be to make them *feel* understood, but for you to *actually understand* their position.

So many times in an argument I've done this only to realize that I've actually misunderstood their position. It's a super useful technique to reach common ground when used properly.</div>

They will be understood when they KNOW that you actually understand. 

It really helps diffuse when you're engaged and actively trying to articulate their position.

I run into that issue often, when I use the term "feel" because it is implying that perception and reality are different.  
I don't want my partner to /Feel/ understood, I want them to /BE/ understood.</div>

If this took like a couple of decades due to some technolocial ceiling, that wouldn't have bothered anyone, but we kind of cracked reality code here and it evolves on a quarterly basis. I would really love to study Java but I can't feel but think that this is a cooked direction, in 5 years you will need only senior class developers and that's it. Nobody wirites the code manually nowadays day after day. I have no idea what to do.</div>

I was taking a required math course in a fashion college in a major city, some easy extra income i guess. So this man was very, very bored teaching uninterested folk about basic math, in a way that was designed to be unfailable basically. Point being when there was any opportunity to have any sort of stimulating conversation, he lept on it. Any slight interest in him or anything was a big deal to this man. One day he was describing the research he was doing at the other university he worked at. He was describing that he had a computer they were working on that was sensitive to brain wave outputs from a distance, and was essentially able to read minds. He said it wasn't like you were able to pick up images and words, and I dont recall what he described exactly anymore, it freaked me out at a point in my life when I was spiraling really bad. This was in 2011. The technology has existed for over a decade. Im sure its been honed by now.</div>

Asking them if they noticed that ads were something they only thought and never said, talked, searched, etc.

I used Codex to run local via the VS code extension and it was amazing. But then I quickly ran into limits and had to wait another 5 days.

Then I realized I could continue to use Codex cloud  and apply the changes into VS code. But it feels like it's a lot worse? It couldn't fix a lot of changes and was even breaking a html css js website.

And is there any difference between using Claude CLI vs the VS code extension?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I read the entire paper. First off, yes it's legit - biggest research org in the world publishing in a top tier journal. The findings suggest a major advance in anti-aging therapies in primates. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies have been tested in primates before, but this study introduced genetic (FOXO3) modification to the MSCs in order to make them resistant to cellular senescence. Long story short: they found plenty of evidence supporting systemic amelioration of aging (more than I care to summarize) with minimal side effects over 44 weeks of bi-weekly infusions. They also explicitly state in the discussion that they had the following objectives:  (1) developing a universal, shelf-ready human stem cell product with enhanced safety and anti-aging efficacy. (2) Establishing a quantitative comprehensive assessment tool for primate multi-organ aging and its interventions. (3) Charting a translational medicine roadmap for future human aging interventions.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is what's called "capitalist realism" (check the book by Mark Fisher). In present-day "western" culture, it's easier to imagine the end of the world than a different system. That's how ingrained ideology has become. Capitalism is a historic system. Just like all other forms of societal organization before, it had a beginning, and it will have an end (or a transition to something else). Now, when exactly? Towards what new system? We don't know.

But, yeah, capitalism without workers and consumers would not keep working as capitalism. It would have to transform into something else.</div>

Like... Let's say you are Elon Musk and nobody can afford to buy a tesla... So what? 

His 100,000 strong fleet of robots can simply farm for him, build him houses, be his bodyguards.

He doesn't need to 'make money' and won't lose sleep about tesla stock price crashing.... In that hypothetical future world.</div>

I read some posts here and other subreddits where people already have access to Codex via their Plus plan, I am guessing that is randomly selected users?

At this point I think it's either a different model. Or local is simply better because it actually sees your files? The cloud version seems to be ChatGPT agent mode where they use their virtual machine? I have no idea what I'm even talking about. Somebody please explain and educate me</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's not solved, it still generates things in one go and no iterative improvement, no feedback from a good critical vision and language model.


Modalities are not unified well enough into one and are not given freedom to interact with each other iteratively. Early steps in this direction are being made but it's constrained by computing power.


It's also what's holding back robots.
Need much more computing power, memory bandwidth and size for context.


Need 3D RAM and compute-in-memory/neuromorphic chips.
Good ones with a lot of 3D layered ram, finally unconstrained by memory bandwidth and simplifying the systems a lot by removing unnecessary levels/types of memory and communication, will come somewhere in 2030s I guess. With the funding AI is getting and the race that has began, I guess early to mid 2030s sound possible.


Imagine how much better things can get with, say, 1 ExaOps chips at ~current sizes/surface areas, with several terabytes of basically infinite bandwidth (not constraining the chip's (fl)ops) memory stacked below or on top of it?


And it would be just the beginning, then later come even more memory layers, tighter and tighter layered inter-weaving of memory and computational circuits operating on it, closer snd closer to how biological brains work but with many orders of magnitude higher energy efficiency and speed ceiling (once the memory wall, the bane of current hardware, is solved, at least for a massively parallel task that is AI).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It looks “too professional” though. Like the angle, lighting, and detail is way “too good”. Even if you take the same camera as the prompt and then take the picture on your own, I can guarantee you’ll likely “miss something”, can be lighting, exposure, or even simply setting up the scene.

Not necessarily a bad thing, but this is one way you can spot it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The camera settings you entered don’t make a lot of sense given the image produced. Like, at all. How would you get trails at that shutter speed? Why would you take this photo with that shutter speed? And at 2.8 on an R6 at 135mm, you’d have razor thin DOF yet everything in the image is in focus.</div>

My friend told me to try meditation. I thought it was stupid at first. But I was so sad, so I tried everything,like YouTube videos, sitting outside, even doing it in my car. and I also tried Faithtime too. My brain was all over the place at first, just racing with random stuff. But after a few weeks, I started feeling better.

This is the problem with America. Those guys are too obsessed with left and right and it goes both ways. I’m happy I live far away from it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Ive been a metal/rock/edm/concert head for a long time now. I HIGHLY recommend people go see an audiologist to get ear molds taken for attenuating ear plugs. 

I just got them made this year and for multi day festivals it’s life changing. You can still talk and have conversations, you can hear the highs/mids/lows. Way better than anything you can find online, including loop, etc. they can even change the inserts in them which change the attenuation factor (mine have 3 levels of reduction) and I use the middle one currently. 

I think they cost around $100-$150</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">yeah it could upend inequities that have existed for centuries, a world where a public defender can have ai find all the same relevant codes and case law as OJ's legal team with dozens of paralegals is a very different world. 

Just a world where the average person can get accurate and effective legal advice when sent a legal notice is a radically different world, big companies no longer able to push customers and sub-contractors around simply by threatening nonsense would make things a lot fairer. 

Knowing your legal rights and being able to access services you have a right to or highlight a valid case for compensation is another game changer for us poors, There's going to be a time when a lot of these companies that essentially just scam people by making it seem like you have no choice will find that a lot of their customers will suddenly be getting accurate advice and this will destroy their illegitimate business model - banks, real estate, travel agents, there are so many examples where a sizable portion of their income comes from people not knowing there's better options or not having the time / energy to battle their way through the hoops to get those better options. When you can get it sorted simply by asking your AI for your options, picking one and instructing it to take the necessary steps then a lot of people are going to save a lot of money they're currently being semi-scammed out of.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think this is just might be the straw that breaks the camels back. We were already divided/there were already enough problems… and as a society, we are hanging on by a thread. I don’t think this the “start” of anything. I do think this could be very, very bad and give certain people the ammunition they need to really, really divide us once and for all.

I recommend people think rationally, and don’t see this as a left vs right thing. These are the symptoms of a very sick society. We need compassion for each other, not more division, not more hate, not more blaming/pointing the finger. This is the result of all of that. We need to come together. Our society is very corrupt, from the top down. If you want to be mad, be mad at the people (both left and right) who are constantly trying to divide us.

I don’t think anger is the answer, though. I don’t think we should give in, and give anyone what they want out of this (which is to stir more discord). We need to come together, as a people, and say enough is enough. We need to learn to love each other, because as common men… we are not so different. 

We have much more in common with each other than the corrupt billionaires playing chess with our lives, all in the name of making more money than they could ever spend. To consolidate more power than any one person/group should ever have. All while the majority of us struggle to feed our families, and argue over their scraps. 

I don’t know exactly how to articulate what I want to say, so I hope my message is coming across the way I intend it. Peace.</div>
