                                <div class="reply-body">This is essential.  Sometimes a stay-cation is very needed too.  I get quite pissy if my holiday breaks etc involve traveling to family/in-laws, sleeping on crappy beds/pull outs just to turn around and be back at work a few days later even more tired and exhausted and anxiety ridden at the inevitable "planning the next trip up" as the current one ends.  I get along with my in-laws well too, I just need time to not do much of anything.  Last year I saved enough vacation to have nearly 3 weeks off at home when combined with my X-mas/new years breaks - I haven't felt so rested in years.

My kids are like this too, they love their pets and their stuff and their space.  My daughter heard we're doing a destination Thanksgiving trip for most of Thanksgiving week with some legit fun stuff and nearly threw a fit over not having any "chill" days because of it.</div>

So no, we will not stop calling you Nazi's and fascists because that's exactly what you are, and unless you're extremely strongly coming out against this shit IE firing and ending these people's political careers, then I don't even care if you've not personally been caught yet, if you align with this shit then you find this shit acceptable and the label fits.</div>

Ignore the fact that neo-nazis called trump their white savior. Ignore the uptick in violent neo-nazi hate crimes when he was president that he never condemned. Ignore the fact that Trump has erased every female and POC in leadership from the government website. Ignore the fact that trump got rid of all documentation of tuskagee airmen. Ignore the fact that he's trying to get rid of juneteenth. Ignore the fact that he is targeting DEIA. Ignore the fact that he plans to end the voting rights act. Ignore the fact that he said he would never trust a black guy to count his money. Ignore the fact that he has fired women and POC in leadership roles. Ignore everything you see and hear. Ignore the fact that Trump said he envied Hitler's military due to their loyalty to him. Ignore the fact that people of color have been warning white people about him for years. None of it has to do with prejudice.</div>

The only difference is that you get to hide behind the facade of plausible deniability. It's arguably a more nefarious position to take, being that you've the luxury to play the "difference of opinion" card when called out. Fucking scumbags.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Holy Jesus they’re giving away even more compute time?! 

Their API charges $0.1 per second (for the standard version). If their costs are half of that, they’re now spending $0.75 per video. 

That’s several dollars a day at least per user, and upwards of $22.50 per day per user (at 30 videos a day). 

Considering potentially millions of users already, this is one of the biggest giveaway of all time.  </div>

Humans are wired with mirror neurons, which cause us to subconsciously mimic the posture, gestures, and tone of people we feel a connection to. By consciously initiating this behavior, you can rapidly generate a feeling of safety and trust in the other person (a state often called limbic resonance).

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree. I noticed a friend of a friend doing this upon our first meeting (I took a drink, she took a drink, I crossed a leg, she crossed a leg, etc.) and it wasn’t subtle like unconscious mirroring. Every time I changed my posture, she would instantly do the same. It felt as if she were trying to gain my trust, however, it had the total opposite effect where I became more wary and kept a closer eye on her.

To be quite honest my read on her was that she was trying to make a good impression and it didn’t come from a place of malice; yet her doing this *still* had the knockoff effect of causing me to feel cautious rather than comfortable.

Overcompensating by mirroring can oftentimes lead to the outcome people are trying to avoid.</div>

For basically 10 years I suffer from a (yet) undiagnoseable/chronic inflammatory intestinal condition. My doctors agree that there is inflammation, I‘m losing safe foods (can barely eat 7 or 8 rn.) and that because of the vitamin deficiencies I have a lot of other conditions (eczema/joint pain and all that fun). Sadly all medications (like t...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Chronic pain sufferer here too.  I have MCAS.  It has a lot of overlapping symptoms you're describing, so you might want to check it out if you haven't already: /r/MCAS.  (I get inflamed muscles up and down my neck and back, migraines, and digestive issues.  Eczema and joint pain I believe is pretty common.)

One thing is if you're laying in bed too much for too many years muscles shrink and then that causes chronic pain too, so regardless what the chronic pain condition is, going to a physical therapist can help a lot.  It's paid for by health insurance thankfully making it easily accessible.

Good luck with everything.</div>

Doctors seriously have no idea when it comes to this illness, and the image online of "gluten free" is pretty bad and it's INCREDIBLY underdiagnosed at around 90% of people who have it have no idea. I highly HIGHLY recommend requesting a test for celiac or just giving up gluten for a week and see how you feel if you haven't already. If you think I'm bullshitting you just go and read up stories on the celiac sub for people who fixed (or at least improved) countless lifetime autoimmune and inflammation issues. good luck</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes ive found similar relief to all sorts of symptoms through meditation / addressing my mental health. I went through a total crisis for years over this mind body stuff. I now believe most chronic pains and symptoms are related to stress, the mind and fear. 

One thing i'd caution, is that you can start to put too much pressure on yourself for meditation to work. Remember that meditation is about being with what is, not becoming calm. You may eventually find that meditation doesn't 'work' like you want it to. I went through this yo-yo experience with many things that worked for awhile, but eventually faded. Remember there's nothing actually wrong with you, its just your brain is confused and has learned to fear symptoms, and foods that you've conditioned yourself to believe are unsafe. 

I highly recommend checking out the youtube channel 'pain free you.' His stress and mind body syndrome manifested as severe back pain, but it can be everything from rashes, GI issues, insomnia, joint pain, hair loss etc. The list is endless. He has interviews with people who've overcome issues just like yours. Find an interview with someone who had issues similar to yours, and I bet it will resonate with you. Good luck.</div>

My only other guess is that a halo brand trickles down and increases the brand reputation of Lexus, etc. but jeez it’s depressing to realize that there are enough ultra wealthy individual’s out there to justify a whole new brand.</div>

There are lots of task in a project that doesn't require an expensive model like a quick refactor, documentation etc. Most real world project uses a mixture of different models for different tasks with the most expensive ones reserved for planning and overall design. Even claude code used 3.5 Haiku for lot of cheap tasks which was a much much worse model and expensive. I switched to a cheap oss model for those tasks and actually saw better performance while saving me a lot of cost.</div>

And this model is 5x cheaper than Claude Sonnet. I don't do vibe coding at all. I have codebases of considerable size that need maintenance and improvements; which is what AI will be used for after the vibe coding gimmick proves unprofitable. AI does all development while I review results and make architectural adjustments.


My point is, in a stable future do you think most developers will still be better served by a $10k/month Sonnet 4.5 vs a $50/month Sonnet 3.7 equivalent? </div>

The most egregious ones:

* Y axis not starting at 0
* X axis?? What are you starting at, where are you going to, is there even a 0? Counterintuïtive direction (most expensive to least expensive?)? No scale, just a singular point.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hey Reddit,

I built a dashboard analyzing the sentiment between Claude Code and Codex on Reddit comments. The analysis searched for comments comparing Claude Code vs Code then used Claude Haiku to analyze the sentiment, and  which model was preferred. It also lets you filter by various categories such as speed, workflows, problem-solving, and code quality. You can also weight by upvotes to make the comparison by upvotes rather than raw comment numbers.

                                <div class="reply-body">Because the MAGA movement (and Tea Party before them) don’t actually care. I forget the name of it but their goal is essentially to overload people’s minds with slop at such a pace that we can’t possibly refute it in a timely way, and by the time we’ve made our rebuttals they’re onto the next thing. It doesn’t matter whether or not it’s true and it doesn’t matter whether or not it’s hypocritical.

The most recent Charlie Kirk stuff is a great example. They flooded the airwaves with it being a left wing attack before anyone could possibly know. And by the time the left wing influencers and politicians started forming clear counterarguments to this they’ve moved on to the next thing. Charlie was already about 5 right wing controversies ago, including Trump bitching about a Far-Left escalator.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The U.S. has positioned itself into becoming the next slum nation based on its reluctance to invest in its citizens. The opposite actually from what China is doing, the U.S. is doing everything it can to continually punish citizens and take away prospects for a future. 

This is not some wild conspiracy theory. We refuse to invest in education, and are removing all safe guards that have existed in the past to help people. The leaders are focused on relatively mundane aspects of our culture such as trans rights which affect less than 1% of the total population. We're going backwards in terms of energy goals. The list goes on and on and on.

People might not see it now, but the U.S. will quickly become a 3rd world nation compared to China if priorities don't switch.

It's unfortunate that the population elected leaders whose primary goals are short term profits over the long term care of the country.

I hope you all are happy with all this winning.</div>

We refuse to invest in education, and are removing all safe guards that have existed in the past to help people. The leaders are focused on relatively mundane aspects of our culture such as trans rights which affect less than 1% of the total population. We're going backwards in terms of energy goals. The list goes on and on and on.

We've basically got a bunch of rich scumbags in charge who are using culture war topics to try and convince people they're doing right by their constituents while robbing them blind.</div>

The one thing you should do is mess with the funding of basic science. Attack the research universities, remove grants for basic science. In the long run, that's a complete disaster. It's going to make America weak.
