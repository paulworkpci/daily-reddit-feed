                                <div class="reply-body">It has weird failure modes resulting from creating a detailed static research plan upfront. 

E.g. if you use an acronym and it puts the wrong meaning for that in the plan the results are doomed. Likewise where the model has a wrong idea about something (like Gemini 2.5 not existing) that gets baked into the search plan.

You can edit the plan, but who does that?

OpenAI DR does better in this respect, the system can revise its ideas based on the search results.

I'm sure Google will switch to a dynamic search plan at some point.</div>

There's clearly ET life out there but it's incredible not one single piece of evidence has ever been presented where you csn say, "holy fuck this is legit".

Can’t say much more than that but I hope to be of service to them and their efforts in the future. I appreciate all of you on Reddit and Twitter who assisted in connecting us…your collective enthusiasm no doubt had an influence!

For all the naysayers out there…they seem pretty forthright, professional and eager to uncover the truth.  Who knows what the future holds ...</div>

- The initial Twitter/X post where OP offered to help Skywatcher by lending his high-end imaging hardware in service to capturing UAP on film in much higher quality: [Link here](https://x.com/JayHHunter/status/1910007289492517169)

Edit - sorry, guess I meant to say if the nda prohibits sharing findings for very long time periods. But sure, thats totally fair that nda is used for other purposes.</div>

They’ve already begun detaining non-citizens who engage in anti-genocide protests. If you think they’re not coming after citizens next you’re a clown. 

This is one of the ways they launder attacks on citizens and their first amendment rights. If they can say it’s not real, it’s not organic, they’re paid by outside agitators, etc, it doesn’t read as contradictory to all the self-described free speech warriors on the right. Hell, look at how a lot of these freeze peach guys react to just the act of protest on social media. The Soros angle is just how they justify their contradictory views.

It’s building up to be read as just the government protecting our nation from an outside agitators (Soros) who want to destabilize our country and rig elections. It’s not much of a stretch using this narrative to start saying that protestors are terrorists. 

The “Hamas supporter” angle on a wide scale only really works for brown people and immigrants. This might be one of the ways they justify locking up or deporting US citizens.

This is all speculation. They might be even dumber and bolder than I’m giving them credit for.</div>

Both sides parrot this claim when they are unable to understand the other side. To these people, the left seems so out of touch with motives so inexplicable the only possible explanation is that someone must be paying them because, to him, no one could possibly be that stupid.</div>

Like even simple stuff like brushing my teeth is a choice I have to make every single time. I hope that makes sense. 


Could you describe what you mean when you say "My body clock is wired and accustomed to these actions." Like how does that feel? Maybe I am just expecting too much but I struggle so hard with forming any of these daily habits and it is more a matter of "I have already done this 30 days in a row; I will be sad if I don't do it today." That is as close to a habit as I can get, but if I don't keep track of it then I will still just straight up forget.


Sorry if this question is overly pessimistic but I always feel jealous when people talk about getting in a rhythm like you have. It's good work for sure!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’m saying! It’s been a bunch of bots lately. And they’re all arguing the same point for some reason. I’m hesitant to call it astroturfing (it’s more like the opposite, it’s really anti-marketing) because why would someone spend time or money on making a bunch of bot posts arguing *against* purchasing products? Not even specific brands. Just any productivity software or apps. Really, who would spend their time and effort on that? Would it be a bunch of different people? Someone training some LLM in are really unique way? Someone trying to prime a market for a new product or class of products? It doesn’t make sense, it’s odd. 

Doesn’t matter though, more than half of the content on the internet today is AI-generated. Dead internet is real, has been for a little while now, and it’s only going to get worse. Oh well</div>

It's that each generation is too computationally costly for the output - which can possibly be very random, like a slots machine. You can give it a really good prompt depicting exactly what you want to happen, but then you hit Generate and PRAY it generate precisely what you want to happen, or else your credit is completely wasted on something nonsensical. Especially when it involves multiple entities interacting like an epic sword fight or wrestling match on a mat. 100% characters go morphy and wibbly wobbly like a messy blob of mud.</div>

The rich are already taking all they can from the poorer and the only leverage poor had is that rich needed their work/money. But now, they don't even need a good chunk of their work - they just need them for manual labor. And with many people needing jobs, the salary of those jobs would go down, and the poor become even poorer. 

Really surprised to see this many people thinking that the government will take care of their needs, when most government in fact do not give a crap about you. Just look at the housing market crisis. They are collectively doing nothing because it benefits the people in government with real estates.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's a natural path.

I see it like large sovereign wealth funds. E.g. Norway has oil, an investment fund and the returns are distributed to citizens.

Replace oil with robots, and it's literally the same.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">In developed countries, absolutely! They’re very seriously reviewing and trialling it.
It of course is not as good if you’re less fortunate in your spawn point, places such as the USA are going downhill at the moment and they are giving up their global hegemony in favour for focusing on an internal economy, which would make UBI harder. If you’re in countries without minimum wages, you will be cheaper than AI for longer therefore less pressure to switch to AI and UBI.</div>

Core technology to generate passable AI videos too.  Instead of trying to one shot the whole scene, you use AI to make all the models and movements the traditional way, then render it in a real engine.  Takes care of the issues with physics, shadows, lighting, etc.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">We (me + one roommate) moved on our own once. On packing day my roommate hadn't finished packing and was essentially useless as she wrapped up, and me and a friend put everything into the POD.

On unpacking day it turned out that my roommate, who had been very confident she could help this time, had to bail about 30 minutes in because she was so out of shape that she was overheating and throwing up just from moving boxes. I had to unpack 95% of the POD for our two bedroom apartment by myself. It was on a corner several houses away and I also had to get everything up the front stairs. I seriously thought my furniture, which was in the back, was going to be lost because after unpacking the rest of the thing by myself I just couldn't figure out how to get the bigger pieces of furniture up the stairs alone. Luckily someone my roommate knew came by after work and helped me get my bed and dressers inside.

I will pay for movers every time. Just because someone believes they can help doesn't mean they can. And I don't fault anyone for not being able to move things, because that was one of the hardest days of my life, but I did tell my roommate she fucked up. I wasn't the one who wanted to try moving ourselves in the first place.</div>

The outlay is painful up front but the whole point is, nothing afterwards is. No digging in. No weird cup spills. No loosening throughout the day until it's pointless. No exposed wires after a week. No torn hooks after a couple of washes. 

Buy a good bra. You deserve it. Your girls deserve it. Your back deserves it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This right here. My husband would always go down to the local furniture store and pick a new mattress. They only carry regular coil spring pillow top mattresses. 

I'm disabled with bad joints and have spent years unable to get decent sleep because I would lay down and it would hurt and the pain would just build until I changed positions, then the cycle would start over. Any bit of pressure would just feel like a hot knife through my hips and knees. 


Last month I finally convinced him to spend a few grand on a tempur pedic adapt mattress. He was very apprehensive about it and thought it was just a gimmick. The first night I literally bawled because I was able to lay down without being in pain. I hadn't been able to do that in almost 20 years. My husband slept so hard he woke up at 11pm and thought it was already morning and was confused when he checked his clock. 

I admit it was pretty expensive but I will absolutely be doing it again when it's time to replace this mattress.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/merecuriousity:

---

Saw it yesterday 4/12 late afternoon. It seemed to move at a stable speed in a very determined/controlled way and wasn't swayed by the wind. It's hard to say if it was black or shiny but I lean black/gray. Not sure where it started or where it ended, just saw it from my deck. I see other videos of orbs and spheres but they all seem metal or shiny. Curious if this is in fact an identifiable flying object

It is moving with the wind so it could be a balloon. But the consistent speed and straight line does look odd. The wind is gusting based on the tree movement but that thing isn’t deviating its path or speed at all.</div>

If you want mint, plant it in a pot as it is super invasive. Don’t even get me started on lemon balm!</div>
