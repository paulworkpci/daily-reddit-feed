They have on billionaires and world leaders and let them pump out straight propaganda for 2-3 hours while they just nod along like morons, and then when you call them out for being spineless tools they take the exact same defense as Tucker Carlson and go "This is just entertainment what do you expect from me im not a journalist!"

Well then why the fuck are having these people on to have serious discussions about serious issues?</div>

"I'm just a stupid guy with a microphone"

This is the talking points of all podcast bros, and Youssef kills it here. At what point of talking to all these people who have political agendas do you stop being just a stupid guy with a microphone?

Joe's been doing his podcast for as long as someone would go to college, university, masters, phd, teach and research, at some point you have to at least say "I'm an accountable stupid guy with a microphone" or "I'm just asking questions based on what people have been telling me for the past years"</div>

They probably has a bot having 100s of convos for him and trying to arrange dates for him. So my guess is you’ll get a generic GPT response to yoir reply.  

My guess is the photos are probably AI enhanced, as well. 

Honestly this is probably a net good thing for society if this destroys dating apps and people have to meet in person and not treat people like disposable commodities. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly this. Remove every single in-between iteration between 4 &amp; 5 and you'd see a far more massive leap that the prior jumps. People are just desensitized because of the fast iteration, but it's worth noting that's exactly what Open AI wanted in the first place.

Of course, they want measurable improvements, but they are always more concerned with societal adaptation. If we jumped straight from basic GPT-4 in March to 5, assuming all other company models also stayed within this range, people would likely lose their collective shit. The reaction to Sora which they admitted was a kind of societal test also proves this, but now we're very used to it.</div>

Also a reminder that, whatever general model they have internally, is as good as a dedicated thinking maths model was only months ago.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A lot of this hits home, especially the “doesn’t sound as easy as people say” part. Too many guides skip over the stuff that actually slows you down once the honeymoon period’s over.

On the design side, the bit about planning UI up front is always where it goes wrong if you skip it. I’ve seen so many projects where people start “vibing” on feature prompts and end up with ten near-duplicate components because nobody had a token structure, or even wrote down what “primary” means.

For anyone using Tailwind or v0 in Figma, my only advice is: don’t skip the system structure before you start dragging things. Write out the spacing and color variables as text, even if you never touch Figma variables. Naming everything up front sounds boring but it kills so much rework later. If you do use Figma variables, tools like [Foundation](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1410375141330186418/foundation) let you skip the grunt work and start with real tokens, so you don’t end up chasing ghosts six screens in.

Solid writeup. This is much closer to how things actually play out in a real build.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Looking at the latest cloud numbers from MS, Google, and AWS, it's becoming obvious that AWS is losing market share to the others, due to AI offerings. 

Amazon has invested $8B into Anthropic. It's now a minority investor (and primary cloud provider) but it's not the same as the partnership between MS &amp; OAI, where MS has rights to all IPs and Models for free, and integrating it into their software stack. And arguably, Google owns the best overall model in Gemini.</div>

I think bezos is too distracted enjoying his money and jassy just isn’t capable enough. 

It’s not like this wasn’t obvious and Amazon was one of the three best companies positioned to pull this off. 

Right now, only Google is doing well. Microsoft is only doing okay.</div>

His strict RTO policies really screwed the company. I used to work there.

Worked in a highly specialized domain (healthcare). RTO starts, ZERO exceptions btw.

Bunch L7s and Principal engineers leave my department. These people were there since pre-acquisition by the way, with ALL of the domain knowledge. I mean these guys knew the business inside out to every intricate detail, both operationally and software side. 

Once these guys left, addressing Sev 2s got incredibly difficult in some situations...not addressing some things during sev 2s accumulated and eventually got hit with multiple sev 1s.

Following their departure, even more people left. Its a snowball effect. Once you don't have anyone to hand hold you during difficult times (Principals and SDE3), there is a lot more pressure and anxiety.

Last I heard, its still a shit storm. On call queue sizes in some teams are 100+ and I remember them being in mid 20s when I left.

Amazon didn't give a rat's ass if domain experts left in a highly specialized business. Think about that.</div>

For example, if you are asking for a raise, ask for 20%. If you're underpaid, the company will see that and adjust you appropriately. Maybe it's 20%, maybe it's 15%, but if you only ask for 10%, that's all you'll get.</div>

I will however play with equity vs salary to try and get to a more agreeable number if I think you’re right. 

Not to say you can’t give what you think is fair, but if you give a really high salary to use as a starting point, it can often be an ending point.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Depending on the project a watermark could be useless. It doesn't take a lot of effort to retype your work. The effort is the thought put behind the project, not its documentation. 

I've seen where companies want you to brief some topic of your choosing(like how to cook dinner, recapping a vacation, etc) so they can see how well you perform at public speaking.  But if anyone asks you to do some proprietary work as part of the interview process that should be a red flag on its own.</div>

I've done mock projects for interviews before and gotten the job. I did one comparing two popular brands that's not related to their industry.

If anyone suggests something that feels directly related to a real project, I'd suggest a mock one instead and if there's resistance, walk away.</div>

You can exfiltrate an entire model by just collecting its outputs.

"You would never steal a car" == "You would never copy and mass aggregate the responses of our LLM."

AI model piracy is about to become a big thing. DeepSeek was just the first.

And there's nothing these companies can do to stop it.

I love to see it. This is why the companies just need to adopt open models. They're going to be fighting an unwinnable war to protect their models.</div>

Anthropic has demonstrated through their actions, public statements, and interpretability research that they are serious about safety. It's a self selecting group of people who all think that AI is going to be very impactful and has the chance of going wrong if not done properly. 

Of all the companies working at the frontier they are by far the most responsible and committed to doing it right. That doesn't mean they're perfect but at its core anthropic is a company full of idealistic people who are trying to do the right thing.</div>

* First prompt: This is ACTUAL Magic. I am a god.
* Prompt 25: JUST FIX THE STUPID BUTTON. AND STOP TELLING ME YOU ALREADY FIXED IT!

I’ve become **obsessed** with this problem. The longer I go, the dumber the AI gets. The harder I try to fix a bug, the more erratic the results. Why does this keep happening?

So, I leveraged my connections (I’m an ex-YC startup founder), talked to veteran Lovable builders, and read a bunch of academic research.

Sometimes I forget myself and a couple of days ago this led me down an hour long adventure trying to get Claude to fix a bug. After about 20 rounds of unsuccessful modifications, it simply disabled the faulty module and everything that calls to it and said something like “this should clear all your debugging errors and allow the program to compile correctly.” - yeah, thanks</div>

Why this works: LLMs get trapped in 'solution tunnels' where each failed attempt actually reinforces the same broken mental pathway. By forcing it to argue AGAINST its own approach, you break the tunnel and force it into a completely different cognitive space.

The fascinating part? This 'tunnel breaking' pattern works for ANY task where AI gets progressively worse - debugging, writing, analysis, you name it. There's some deep cognitive mechanics happening that nobody talks about.

Try it next time you hit attempt #3 and report back - I'm collecting data on this</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yep, that matches what I've seen from the research.

In one paper I read, they had a second LLM guide the first by encouraging better meta-cognitive behaviors. One of their techniques was to ask a question like:

&gt;The expected output was a list of integers, but your code produced a TypeError. Is the output correct? Answer only 'yes' or 'no'.

Forcing the LLM to say, specifically, that its approach was wrong helped force it to get out of the current possibility branch and explore new ones.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The amazing thing is stuff like this works: "You realise you're in over your head and grab a more senior colleague to help. You quickly summarise the situation so far and then he takes over." With maybe some character backstory for the "senior" where you make him the opposite of the moron you're currently talking to ("He doesn't panic when he makes a mistake. His deep experience tells him even seniors write code that breaks sometimes and he has a quiet confidence that he can resolve the issues, methodically, without jumping to conclusions."). You'll, immediately, be talking to a different person, who does better in the next couple of prompts than the first "character" ever did.

It's not the model, it's just managed to get itself into a "story" where it's incapable and you have to give it a narrative reason to break that. Especially when it's got to the point where its entire context window is repetitive failure, it won't ever fix the problem. Competence at that point would break narrative continuity.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Ok. Lots here. First of all, meditation isn't something you get "good" at, or could be "bad at." This is a very western perspective. We tend to do that to things like yoga as well. This is something you practice, and as time goes on, you will find longer periods of time when you can control your mind, and you will have shorter periods of time that you can do this, it's irrelevant. You just do it, and do it regularly. That is your practice.

Second you really need to get some energy out. I really do recommend something physical. Could be a light jog, could be some yoga, but just do something because it sounds like you have a great deal of pent up energy. Get some of that out, then try for some meditation.

Third, you are talking about all these intrusive thoughts. A good exercise can be to just say to yourself "I wonder what my minds next thought will be?" And when that thought bubbles up, don't identify with the mind, be the observer, and just observe the thought. It may even become humorous to you, when you realize that you are NOT your mind, you are above it. Immediately just repeat the exercise, "I wonder what my next thought will be?" You will run through a bunch of stuff that is bothering you but don't dwell, observe the thought and just repeat the exercise. You will see the mind scrambling to have some sort of relevance, but it will get more and more ridiculous "I was embarrassed in front of everyone in third grade..." Just observe and take no need, you are NOT your mind. It's just a calculator, but by identifying with it you have given it power over your world. You are NOT your mind.

Once your intrusive thoughts are subdued then you can try to focus on stuff like embodiment, a touch, a smell, a sound, a taste, a sight, and ground yourself. You can also try thing like count to 7 over and over to occupy the mind and keep it quiet. The goal here is just to relax, and try to stay in this place as long as you can. If you leave that state, just start over and try again, but don't beat yourself up or speak negative words about yourself or the situation. Just take a breath, "I wonder what my next thought will be?"

Good luck on your journey</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think you should consider Qi Gong.

It requires you to sync your breath to a pattern of slow body movements that stretch and compress gently specific sections of your body's fascia that are named meridians and are supposed to circulate subtle energy (qi/prana) to your body.

Easy to learn.

Difficult to master.

Some routines will target specific emotions (fear, anger, grief, etc.) by doing the same squeeze/relax pattern on fascia regions that are connected to organs which store these emotions.

Think of a tube through which a water-like substance runs and has blockages in various sections of the tube. You don't want to flush out all of a sudden all those blockages at the same time because you can't control the process and might end up with a bigger blockage. So you're going to massage the tube where it feels stuck very gently over a long time to wear down those blockages into something finer.

So when you do a specific move for kidneys, you are engaging in that stretch/compress motion in a gentle manner and flush out fear (which is stored in kidneys). Same goes for liver (anger), lungs (grief), and so on.

Anyway, if all this fails, at least, you will end up with way stronger core muscles than you have right now, be able to walk straight and sit at the edge of a seat for long periods without being bothered, and be able to breathe better and easier.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Why you are doing great. You are experiencing the true force of meditation instead of suppressing it like many meditators mistakenly do. Feel it, enjoy it if you can, but if you can't enjoy it it's okay, you've meditated. 

I know this doesn't feel real but even pain can be enjoyed in meditation. It's life. Pain is part of life. So is anger. Don't resist, feel it and I guarantee you nothing will happen to you. What ends up happening is you will score 1 more meditation for today, and hooray.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I hear your good intentions, and, without wanting to be abrasive, I'd like to gently offer that I believe your response shows a lack of awareness of the harm that can come from meditation  - particularly if there is trauma in the background - of fragmentation, psychosis etc.

For those that experienced early trauma, coming into contact with the painful and "too big" feelings inside is not only re-traumatising, but risks flooding the person with overwhelming feelings not dissimilar to the original traumas. For some - to be able to sense in needs to be learnt gently, in a titrated manner so as not to overwhelm the person.

Many kids that were taught meditation were taught "sit still! Go inside!" And yet they have all this crazy energy inside that doesn't know what to do with itself. In a sense it might even replicate all those times they were left alone with unbareable feelings from mis-attuned caregivers. And if they do manage to sit still, it might look like they are doing a great job of meditating, but likely they are over-riding themselves and possibly sending their nervous system into a freeze response. 

So - perhaps for you it is easy to sit with what is painful inside and stay stable, but for many many people it is not. And consider - if it was that easy, everyone would be meditating! :)

I had to come at it sideways, as I was overriding myself by forcing myself to sit with inner agitation. Now - I could sit forever with curiosity and open awareness and when I touch into agitation it dissolves into peace or a sense of being able to be wholly with all that is, contradictions and all! But I had to take a windy route to get there, and I wholeheartedly believe that being trauma sensitive is super important in this space (again, Spirit Rock has highly trained trauma specialists on hand for this exact reason).

I hope this might make some sense to you, and also wish you well on your own journey inwards :)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt; The 19-year-old Naibel Benavides, who was a college student at the time, died on April 25, 2019, after being struck by a Tesla Model S sedan driven by George Brian McGee. McGee had dropped his phone while approaching a T-intersection with Tesla’s Autopilot software activated. The NYT report states that he drove through the intersection at more than 50 mph, crashing into the legally parked SUV of Benavides and her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, on the other side.

&gt; It was also reported that McGee's foot was on the accelerator pedal as he approached the intersection, thereby overriding a function of Autopilot that is capable of stopping for objects in the road. The lawyer representing Benavides' family said that data and video from the crash showed that the Autopilot system recognized the parked SUV and at least one pedestrian before the collision.

How in the world is tesla even partially responsible here, his foot was on the accelerator. The best L2 systems will override if you have your foot on the accelerator, the car recognized the obstacle. Should we really set precedent that the car should have priority over human inputs? Am I missing something?

The name is misleading, but autopilot in 2019 could not stop at stop signs, lights, etc.. Like, two seconds with the system or two seconds in the manual and you would know this.</div>

&gt;The best L2 systems will override if you have your foot on the accelerator,


This is not entirely true. It would defeat the whole point of the "Automatic Emergency Braking" feature that virtually all cars sold today have. Think of a situation where you are looking at your radio controls, and a child runs out across the street. You'd have your foot against the pedal to maintain speed. If any amount accel pedal was allowed to override, you'd hit the child.


Most OEMs calibrate the system to require a substantial amount of acceleration pedal depressed to override the system. In many cases, as much as 80%.</div>
