                                <div class="reply-body">Claude 4 Opus's 7 hour claim was part of Anthropic's actual messaging, directly.

~~The 30+ hours figure is a random company's review that was put up on the 4.5 website among a dozen others.~~

Turns out it is one of Anthropic's claims, as per [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/787524/anthropic-releases-claude-sonnet-4-5-in-latest-bid-for-ai-agents-and-coding-supremacy).

The definition of "autonomous coding" can be stretched, and its theoretically possible for agents to run for dozens of hours. The METR long horizon graphs shows error bars  that can go quite wide. Main issue would be the actual reliability, which a few weeks of 4.5 use will reveal for us.

EDIT: Forgot, but yeah obviously METR will give a proper evaluation</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah I actually asked Grok to give me links to reddit threads about this scenario, because it came to the point that I wondered if reddit would do a better job than Grok or "new ChatGPT". The most galling thing about reddit threads is not the bad advice, but how redditors just assumed the husband was at fault because his wife wanted to leave him, and they downvoted OP, the husband.

I actually asked ChatGPT and Grok to tell me what I might be doing wrong, because if it's my fault, for sure I want to fix what I can. I want something to be wrong that I can fix. But ChatGPT assured me that my wife's pattern of behavior closely relates to insecurities stemming from being raised in a violent home where a child doesn't receive attention from parents, saying that it messed up a person's sense of self validation. That feedback was very helpful for me, and there's little chance I would have got that insight from applicable subreddits.</div>

Meditation is a powerful tool with many proven benefits ‚Äî such as reducing stress, improving focus, and increasing emotional resilience ‚Äî but it's not a cure-all. Here are some things meditation will not help with (or at least not sufficiently on its own) in my experience:

1. Serious Mental Health Disorders (Without Professional Treatment)

Meditation may complement therapy, but it won‚Äôt replace evidence-based treatments for conditions like:

Major depressive disorder

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;Major depressive disorder

I went to several mental health professionals (psychologists, therapists, counselors, and psychiatrists), and they weren't able to help at all with my treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. In fact, CBT-i and psychotropic prescriptions worsened my symptoms and made me actively suicidal. Thank God, I came across yoga nidra, and after many hours of practice, my mood improved drastically. It was through meditation that I was able to experience adulthood without all-consuming depression.

While meditation is not appropriate for all of those conditions, depending on the practice, sometimes it's what makes all of the difference.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hmmm, I lowkey think meditation helps with literally everything you listed‚Ä¶ but also agree that serious mental/physical issues should be tackled with getting professional help as well. 

For me, meditation and connecting with my spiritual side was a serious game changer for managing my chronic illness, and helped me find relief that I never felt from my prescribed medications. 

But also I definitely understand your sentiment, and agree overall. Meditation is not the only thing you need to do in your life (for most ppl). It‚Äôs the gateway to clarity of mind, which leads to the right actions to improve your life.</div>

- Read newspapers and magazines for free online, including the NYT, WSJ, WaPo and Consumer Reports 
- Check out tools, cooking implements and other such items 
- Get free museum passes 
- Use library computers and printers, the latter often for free or low cost 
- Check out ebooks and e-audiobooks and watch streaming videos

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;For our "high compute" numbers we adopt additional complexity and parallel test-time compute as follows:
We sample multiple parallel attempts.
We discard patches that break the visible regression tests in the repository, similar to the rejection sampling approach adopted by Agentless (Xia et al. 2024); note no hidden test information is used.
We then use an internal scoring model to select the best candidate from the remaining attempts.
This results in a score of 82.0% for Sonnet 4.5.

Doesn‚Äôt seem like this is something they can offer through their api, but it does seem like something you could implement on your own. It would increase your token usage quite a bit.</div>

3. Gemini 2.5-Pro, 67.2%</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You should honestly compare how much usage Gpt5 pro gives for 200 vs Opus4.1 for 200. 

In my experience, Sonnet 4.1 thinking gave me around 1/5 the usage on gpt 5 thinking. 

And I'd choose gpt5 thinking any day over sonnet, unless I was writing some front end react code. 

5thinking is not officially my o3's big brother, altho it took me a while (as Autistic adhd person) to move away from o3. 
But gpt5 thinking is built different, gpt5 pro is just juiced up 5 thinking or even better.

He has solved extreme niche (physics + math + options) theoretical issues and helped me code through the borderline PhD level math. 

When using Sonnet he honestly couldn't do much, but I didn't mind using token to get the code double checked via him aswell, but he clearly isn't as intelligent or had domain depth like gpt5. 

As an adhd person, I am extremely competent in knowing a lot of useless information about a lot of useless things, in extreme depth lol. 

In a very specific example (In options based Algorithmic theoretical model). 
I knew a very specific and very interesting/ random idea that would greatly help the system. 
Without telling the AI's I gave multiple of them the exact information and asked for feedback with (no bullshit so they don't give good tow shoes response). 

Among everyone, 5 thinking and pro are so far the only models who were able to accurately guess exactly the specific idea out of thin air, and almost the exact configuration I thought would work best, they suggested that it would be optimal if we added that xyz. 

Since that day, I'm back on team OAI lol. 

I never thought my truly random but genius thought would be an output, felt like hitting a $10 call goes to  $10000 in return. Basically 0 odds. 

The model are not good enough than imo they are smarter than 98.5% of the world. 
On metric scale, I would at ~ 98% in cognitive terms, and I strongly believe gpt5 thinking (without pro) is above me. 

O3 felt like I had found my first true peer who I could talk to and he understood the depth after I already described the events, gpt5 thinking however, can reasonably thinking by himself at my level and help further. 

I didn't mean to type the response in such a long manner and deviate away from main cost topic lol, but my meds haven't kicked in yet (6:40 am still). 

But I couldn't take gpt5 thinking/pro relative comparison given how good he is. 
There is no better way to spend 200 bucks imo, but it surely relies a lot of how good the user itself is. 

I also feel, this is the reason AI is going to go a wee bit downhill in use case by many folks soon, because the person using it need to be at their level to extract that level of data.

&gt; And yet, at the same time, whether it‚Äôs automated systems or the way a trip gets planned, there are things that Ford is working on to add on top of that digital experience of Google and CarPlay that will make it even better.‚Äù


&gt; Farley said that Ford is still committed to consumer choice, meaning he has no plans to limit access to CarPlay or Android Auto 

Farley has a point, where do you want to draw the line on what ford handles and what they don't? and if that line is anything except 100%, why not just handle the rest yourself instead of painstakingly working with apple?

I think standard CarPlay is still the better balance for most manufacturers, w/ ultra you have to develop the UI for each vehicle, and as the critical info is rendered on the car itself, you have to make sure the vehicle is up to it, thats quite a bit of work

They recently set up turn-by-turn navigation from CarPlay+gmaps in the instrument cluster, and they let you dedicate almost the entire screen to CarPlay</div>

My experience with Apple‚Äôs mobile apps indicate that 1) there is not sufficient feedback from field testing to design 2) Apple tends to prioritize design aesthetics/coherence over utility.  

Apple design philosophy may work well on devices where user has time luxury to fiddle around and discover their features, but it is the wrong approach for instrument gauges for moving vehicles.  

If you‚Äôve used apps like ForeFlight, you‚Äôll know why Apple apps (Maps for example) is not done properly for this use case.</div>

The study Swedish Motoring Magazine recently released is mind-blowing. Traveling at 100km/hr, the driver of a car with HVAC in the infotainment system has to look away from the road for 1500 meters to turn on the AC and adjust the temperature. A car with buttons only took 300 meters of distraction.¬†
That puts the distraction on point with an ABV of 0.1, which is put your ass in prison and take away the license for life in many countries... and theres hundreds of studies showing this same or similar outcome. TRL UK has many.¬†


If we can't text n' drive, and all agree that it's as dangerous as drink driving... then why can I tap n' drive with a touchscreen infotainment. 15 year old idiot me knew it was a fucking stupid idea, 25 years ago when all the patents were being filed for this malarky.¬†</div>

Improved coordination across multiple tools and information sources enables the model to effectively leverage a wide range of capabilities in agentic search and coding workflows.

three weeks ago amidst all the claude inference issues, [i made a comment about sonnet feeling way faster like it was doing parallel tool calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ndafeq/3month_claude_code_max_user_review_considering/ndgevtn/?context=3), now i'm thinking i was A/B tested on. i'd never seen sonnet perform that well before</div>

Tbh, there's some blame you can put on Sam though. He has constantly talked about treating users "like adults" and saying the models should be able to talk about taboo topics or be flirty... It doesn't seem like the rest of the C-suite agrees.</div>

They make such over the top and intense arguments, never have objective evidence, and their experience never matches with anything I've experienced despite excessive use. 

They all claim that they're using it for serious business but none of them can explain what this entails, they used to claim it was 'creative writing' but 5 is fantastic at creative writing compared to 4 when prompted to do so, the only thing it doesn't do it pretend to be your lover.</div>

Then at some point a year or so ago, I had to unsub because it was just flooded with the dumbest takes.

Yes, 5-high can output a ton of tokens (and start circling around eventually), but it's also so much \_safe\_ it's disgusting. It can write Hailely-like procedurals well, but in terms of pulp/webnovels - even Gemini is miles ahead. 4o? It can straight up ignore parts of prompt, it doesn't try to cram all your scene context into it, it can rearrange orders of events, it's not trying to write \_safe\_.</div>

&gt;Hany Farid, a world-renowned expert in digital forensics and image analysis, told Nova‚Äôs ‚ÄúParticles of Thought‚Äù podcast that computer science is no longer the future-proof career that it once was.

&gt;Farid was discussing the reasons that podcast host Hakeem Oluseyi‚Äôs son, a college senior who is studying computer science, is struggling to find work.

&gt;‚ÄúFor people like your son, by the way, who four years ago were promised, *Go study computer science, it‚Äôs going to be a great career. It is future-proof* ‚Äî that changed in four years,‚Äù Farid said.

From a [*Business Insider*](https://www.businessinsider.com/computer-science-students-job-search-ai-hany-farid-2025-9) article on the same subject:

&gt;"Our students typically had five internship offers throughout their first four years of college," Farid said. "They would graduate with exceedingly high salaries, multiple offers. They had the run of the place. That is not happening today. They're happy to get one job offer."
