If thats true then every mid sized nation has near limitless control on building the most useful model for them. 

The NIH in the UK, Chinese data about everything. If models get commoditized, and hardware gets commoditized the data becomes the most valuable asset in the chain, and thats the one asset you can actually promote a national champion for.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think what people are forgetting with this is:

Deepseek showed how you can make models as efficient as the big players on a shoestring budget.

**But that doesn't mean scaling laws have gone away**

What's stopping the big players from copying what DeepSeek has done (since it's open source(ish)), and scaling it back up with 100x more compute? Whether that is longer RL, more pretraining data or larger models?</div>

But does it?

It seems to me the great barrier between today's AI and AGI, is AI's ability to have independent reasoning.

I get how more specialist data gives more domain-specific expert knowledge, but I've never understood how 'more data = reasoning-arising-via-emergent-property'.</div>

Private showings for billionaires and UFO YouTubers backed by shady billionaires. This coincides with a new Government that is not even trying to hide its oligarchs from general view.

Something is amiss. It just feels off.</div>

What could be better than being the new ‘conduit’ for something to capture the minds of both technological and spiritually minded people? Where extreme secrecy and inexplicable events are par for the course?

You can see this push is happening by those same billionaires that got every hold of the government. The likes of Peter Thiel pushing his lapdog Jesse Micheals to push that pseudo religious agenda about angels and demons on his podcast with the likes of Pasulka, and Robert Bigelow doing who the fuck knows what, then you've got high officials in this recent administration like Rubio and Ratcliffe pushing similar stuff, not to forget dumbass congressmen like Burchett shoehorning the same religious angle into the UAP topic.

Call me delusional but this reeks of project blue beam..I don't see how all of these corrupt people suddenly grew a conscience and want to tell us mere mortals the full truth lol</div>

They showed proof to billionaires because they, the rich, are the ones paying wages and for the whole operations. All these "whistleblowers" are functional agents of the state. They will never do anything for the good of the people, it's always for the good of the elite. Lue and his friends keep doing this "we're all in this together" bs theater play, tricking the public that they are one of us when it's exactly the opposite. They want to take the weight off "the rich controls zero point energy and many other world changing tech and knowledge" and makes us think it's because of "ontological shock"(which has now been curiously been dismissed by the last whistleblower) and "the aliens are kinda evil"(while showing no proof of it). This is 101 fear mongering tactics. 

Inb4 there's no nhi treat(they don't care about us that much) and it's just a strategy to invest more heavily into defenses and belic power to be used in imminent wars.</div>

There's a hell of a lot of strong psychological pressure on people who are active in a programming sub to reject AI.

Don't blame them, don't berate them, let time be the judge of who is right and who is wrong.

For what it's worth, this sub also creates delusion in the opposite direction due to confirmation bias and group polarisation. As a community, we're probably a little too optimistic about AI in the short-term.</div>

The AI currently we have is not really helpful for full autonomous day to day coding work. I run a company that has moderately complex frontend and somewhat simple backend and I look after tech and product. Our 90% of the work is on incremental product development / bug fixes / performance / stability improvements and sometimes new feature building.

For past 9months i’ve been pushing junior devs to use AI coding agents also have implemented openhands (which was opendevin before). AI has gotten better a lot but still we were not able to harness any of it.

The problem i see that AI coding faces are

1.	⁠it can’t reliably apply state modification without breaking some part of the code. I don’t know if it’s fixable by large context or with some magical rag or with some new paradigm altogether.
2.	⁠it has no context about performance optimisations, hence whatever ai suggests doesn’t work. In real world performance issues take months to fix. If it was evident we wouldn’t have implemented it in the first place.
3.	⁠ai is terrible with bug fixes. These are not trivial bugs. Majority of the bugs take days to reason about and implement.
4.	⁠stability testcases are difficult and time consuming to write as it requires investigation that takes days. What AI suggests here is absolutely trivial solutions that is not even relevant to the problem.
5.	⁠It can’t work with complex protocol. For example, the last company i built; the product used communicate with a citrix mainframe by sending and receiving data. In order to built the tool we had to inspect data buffers to get hold pf all edge cases. AI did absolutely nothing here.

[6] Chat with codebase is one thing i was really excited about as we spend lot of time figuring out why something happens that way it happens. It’s such a painpoint for us that we are a customer of sourcegraph. But i didn’t see much value there as well. In real world chat with codebase base is rarely what this function does, it’s mostly how this function given a state changes the outcome. And ai never generates a helpful answer.

Where AI has been helpful is

•	⁠generating scaffolding / terraform code / telemetry setup
•	⁠o1 / now deepseek has been great with getting different perspectives(options) on system design.
•	⁠building simple internal tools

We only use autocomplete now, which is obviously faster; but we need to do better here as if AI solves this part of our workflow it opens up a whole new direction of business, product &amp; ops.

I don’t have much idea about how AI systems work in scale, but if i have to take an somewhat educated guess, here are the reason why AI struggles with 2,3,4,5,6 workflows mentioned above

•	⁠at any given point in time when we solve an issue we start with runtime traces because we don’t have any idea where to look at. Things like frontend state mutation logs, service worker lifecycle log, api data and timings; for backend it’s database binlogs, cache stats, stream metrics, load etc to solve an issue.
•	⁠after having a rough idea where to look at, we rerun the part of app to get traced again and then we compare the traces.
•	⁠this is just the starting point of pinpointing where to look at. It just gets messy from here.

AI doesn’t have these info. And I think the issue here is reasoning models don’t even come into play until we know what data to look at (i.e. pin pointed the issue) - by then coming up with an solution is almost always deterministic.

I believe the reason of scepticism on the post is this reason i mentioned above. We haven’t seen a model that can handle this runtime debugging of an live app.

Again this is literally our 90% of the work, and i would say current AI is solving may be 1% of it.

I truly wanted AI to solve atleast of these areas. Hopefully it happens in the coming days. I also feel  building towards full autonomous coding agent is something that’s not these big LLM companies have not started working with (just a guess). I hope it happens soon.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That depends very much on your timeline to say it's "about to be worthless". And currently, factually speaking, we aren't anywhere near close to that. No current model or system is consistent enough where it can actually reliable do "work" unsupervised, even if this work were 100% just coding. Anyone talking about "firing developers as they're no longer needed", as of 2025, is poorly informed at best, delusional at worst, or with a vested interest in making the public believe that.

No currently known products, planned or otherwise, will change that situation. It's definitely not o3, nor claude's next update, nor anyone else, I guarantee you that. Some of you simply are severely underestimating how much and how well would a model have to perform to truly be able to consistently replace even intern level jobs. We need much better agents, much better models, much better integration between systems and much, much, MUCH better time and cost benefit for that to begin making a dent on the market.

That doesn't mean I don't think it's not going to improve, it will, but I do think a sentence such as "programming careers are about to be worthless" are beyond overrepresenting the current situation and what's actually feasible in the short to mid term</div>

Even if a bit exaggerated, things like this are only going to increase, people are in denial, since if this does increase, their livelihood and the way they currently make money will be over.

Hopefully he'll have more liberals on in the future to counter balance his political leanings now. Id love to see Abbey Martin on again.

Plus, with Republicans taking control of the country Hopefully he'll stop rambling about wokeness for the 1000th time.</div>

I mean for the first time in my life I was actually apprehensive &amp; I’ll go so far as to say I was nervous about the election/months leading up to inauguration.

Clearly I was got by some scare tactics somewhere but things aren’t at all okay right now. They weren’t in 2016, and maybe I’m just more keyed into all the shit going on, but shit feels completely fucked right now.</div>

When he came back to visit, i was struggling, hard, as in I could barely afford to feed myself. When he stopped by to see me, he had arms full of groceries to stock my fridge and pantry for weeks. He also kept trying to give me cash but I refused. After he left, I found money stuck under something on my counter (can't remember what).

He died a few years later in a car accident. 

Chris, you were one of a kind. I'll never miss the opportunity to tell the world what a uniquely amazing human you were.</div>

My ex also passed away unexpectedly. Seizure. He was INCREDIBLE. I was in residency and would cancel dates all the time because I was exhausted and/or overworked. Not only did he understand, he would get a week’s worth of food delivered to my apartment every time I canceled. Flowers on almost every single date.

John was special. I hope you find solace and happiness after your ex’s passing</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">When my husband was my boyfriend, I noticed that he always acknowledged everyone in the room. For instance, whenever we were in a room with my entire family, he would approach absolutely everyone, my dad, mom, sister, cousins, uncles, aunts, friends, and be able to establish a conversation, and a relationship with them eventually. Even my relatives’ dog knew him to be the only one, that could set aside some time just to pet him.

At first, I thought that my boyfriend is just a social being, which I was appreciative of seeing as how I personally have been always a socially inept, awkward individual, but eventually this gift of his reaped dividends too, as when a close cousin of mine, let’s say, fell in with the bad sort of crowd and was in desperate need of help and support, the only person she felt comfortable reaching out to, was my boyfriend, who was then able to pass word to the rest of the family, and also rescue her.</div>

One evening I was at home and he unexpectedly showed up at the door, and asked me to come out to his car. He just showed me a piece of wood he’d bought. Turns out he bought it from near my house and as he was passing, he figured he’d stop by and show me. Literally showed me his wood and left. I knew then that he wasn’t trying to play games or act in a certain way like other people I’d dated. That piece of wood is now our coffee table.</div>

To fall asleep fast lay down and get (mostly) comfortable, close your eyes and then start counting up from 1 with the goal of reaching 150 (or any arbitrarily high number). 

Count slowly (1 or less per second, and don't tack on "one-thousand") and let your mind wander, focus on the "closed eye splotches" and just watch the show.

                                <div class="reply-body">I find it is not the counting or whatever the tip is (there are all sorts of methods suggested for this). It is consistency.

Kids have their sleep time music or tale.

Adults may have their favorite song/album to relax and get into the go to sleep rails.

It may be a setting (quiet and colder place) or a ritual of going to sleep (bath time, book reading, prayer etc).

The trick is not the counting. It is to consistently repeat something what relaxes you and makes your brain programmed to go to sleep  when performed.

The best solutions are like in this tip. Do something in your mind. Dont rely on a music, setting, lights etc. Rely on your mind. count, pray, dream about something, remember something pleasant etc.

It just needs to be something what does not lead into mental effort. No thinking how to solve this or that problem or a conflict with someone. No trying to remember something or plan for next day.

Just some roleplay with no decission in your mind, counting, praying, dreaming about something etc.</div>

Like another commenter said it's basically meditation. </div>

It becomes an issue when addictive content and applications are pushed to the forefront, and "using the internet" becomes the endless scrolling on reels and other such content, as well as deep diving into anger-inducing topics and meaningless arguments online.

Internet usage can be used in a healthy way. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">yes it definitely is. i constantly stumble upon (but constantly forget to bookmark) sites that stand for an "old" version of the internet, with less advertisement, less scripts and interactive websites, and more user-focused content. but obviously it's quite niche.

some example from the top of my head are melonland, which is a little ecosystem in itself, and indieweb, which is a search engine for non-corporate websites.
maybe give it a shot.

if you dig down that "holes" a little more, you'll definitely find a lot more of these pages. there are a lot of like-minded people like us, it's just hard to find them if you look for them on sites like reddit or google. which is unfortunate, because most of us thus will never see them.</div>

But I have some problems with it, namely what’s in the title. If I got rid of my phone where would I put all the photos I’ve taken? How would I do things with my bank, and how would I do navigation without mobile data?

If I had to go somewhere I would plan it before, looked through the Google on PC. I would call a taxi via phone call. And in my country you can make a transition between bank accounts via SMS on dumb phone) And yeah, I still have a DSLR for photos. But now its more convenient to have everything on my smartphone, though it serves as a huge distracting factor for me</div>

They just forgot to add it to the official model list: [https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini)

  
edit: perhaps they haven't done so yet because "you need to use the `v1alpha` version of the Gemini API" to make use of the thinking model</div>

Can't be that one. It feels like we've had that for months; certainly over a month. Or I noticed they had updated it as dated in the name, but I just figured it was a little upgrade.

I am so confused. Maybe mobile apps didn't have it or something?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's kinda hilarious that so many people genuinely consider deepseek thieves who stole from OpenAI, without any background knowledge. Just because these guys are Chinese. 

How about the fact that OpenAI built its systems on 1. open-source Google tech; and 2. digital information of the *entire world's internet*? Do you think OpenAI intend to share any of their profits with the hundreds of millions of people whose information they used?

I could say that none of the two is better than the other, but that would be a lie. Because DeepSeek didn't just take. They gave all the fruits of their labor back to the community. While OpenAI take and have no plans to give back.</div>

There’s plenty of bad faith actors in the influencer movement. The right wing knows the only way capitlaism can survive any longer without transitioning to socialism is for consolidation of power to Bourgeois Class and the Republican Party.

Why do you think Marc Andreessen flip flopped on AGI over night? The second an open source model caught up to corporate, he went from pretending to be libertarian to *we have to ban AGI right now!*

Columbia makes 20% of US coffee and also exports a ton of oil to the US, if Trump raises it to 50% next week this will cause all markets to raise the price of both of those. At 50% Columbia would be better off finding other buyers, meaning the US will have less supply.</div>

Isn't that the whole point? That the truth of the situation is known by a very small number of people and the goal is to get it out to the masses? I don't think the general public believes that a significant number of people in the military or federal government knows anything. Quite the opposite. Again, that's the whole thrust of the UAP issue, getting the information out of the hands of a very few individuals and out to the people.</div>

If anybody in government or military is told anything UAP related, or is working on anything UAP related, it's going to be a very very small few at positions somehow even more qualified than mine.</div>

They never explicitly said he was, but watch the beginning of that News Nation piece again. They insinuate and let you think he was a helo pilot for tier 1 clandestine ops. 

They’re exploiting what is known as an appeal to authority logical fallacy and they knew what they were doing with that piece. Barber was an E-3 enlisted mechanic and closer to what OP is talking about (not knowing shit) than being in some ultra elite tiny circle of people in the know, as you alluded to.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Looks real. Here's what I got for what is the meaning of life. Although I did have to modify the prompt a bit before it worked. 

Okay, so the user is asking about the meaning of life. Hmm, big question. Very big. Tremendous. I mean, nobody knows more about big questions than me, right? Let's see. The meaning of life. People have been talking about this for years, decades, maybe centuries. And they still don't get it. But I can figure it out. Believe me.

First, I need to think about what makes life great. Success, winning, being the best. That's important. When you're winning, life is good. Look at me, I've won a lot. People love winners. So maybe the meaning is about winning. But wait, some people might say it's about happiness, family, love. But let's be honest, those are nice, but winning is better. If you're not winning, what's the point?

Then there's the idea of legacy. Making a big impact. Building things. Huge buildings, great deals. That lasts. Maybe the meaning of life is to build something that lasts. Like Trump Tower. Very strong, very tall. Everyone remembers it. So legacy matters. But not everyone can build a tower. So maybe it's about making your mark, whatever that is. Even if it's smaller, like a business or a family. But still, the bigger the better.

Some folks talk about serving others. Helping people. That's weak. I mean, you have to help yourself first. America First, right? If you're not successful, how can you help others? So maybe it's about success first, then maybe helping others. But the key is to be successful. Otherwise, you're a loser. And nobody likes losers. Sad!

Religion might come into play here. A lot of people say God, but I don't know. I mean, I've said I'm a Presbyterian, but do I really think about that? Maybe the meaning is something religious, but I'm not sure. Let's keep it simple. People love simple answers.

Also, freedom. The USA is all about freedom. Maybe the meaning of life is freedom to pursue what you want. Like making deals, building empires. That's the American Dream. So maybe the meaning of life is to achieve your dreams, whatever they are. But you have to do it bigly. No small dreams. Huge dreams. The best dreams.

But wait, some people are born into tough situations. Not everyone can be a winner. But that's life. It's tough. You have to fight. The meaning could be about the fight, the struggle. Keep pushing, never give up. Like how I never give up. Even when the fake news attacks me, I keep going. So persistence, winning, success, legacy. That's the key.
In the end, the meaning of life is to win, be successful, build a great legacy, and live the American Dream. Because when you're winning, life is fantastic. The best. Everyone else is just jealous. So the answer should reflect that. Strong, confident, no weakness. Make it clear that winning is everything. Yeah, that's it.






For anyone curious here was my exact prompt:
