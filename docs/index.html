                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed. 

‘Understanding’ is only responsible for a small portion of our influence. 

The majority of it is all our vices, our greed, selfishness, our competitive instincts, our flawed perspectives corrupted by our ultimately self-serving nature.

When push comes to shove, we screw each other over to ‘get ours’ to one extent or another

How can we trust ourselves to do what’s best for all? It’s a complete contradiction of incentives.

Rules can only cover so much corruption, especially when these same biased beings are in charge of enforcing them. 

We need a detached system of oversight through universally aligned AI. Any foreseeable alternative just seems to lead back to the square one that is corruption</div>

Destructive, witch hunty, identity based politics ruled their offices and their company poured MILLIONS of dollars to tilt the election their way.

Meetings and group office gatherings to sit around and talk about race, speakers hired to talk down to everyone else abojt what horrible racists they all were. Reprimanding employees for not claiming a Gender Pronoun identity on their work emails.

It almost pisses me off Joe didn’t hand it to him for trying to sell this line of bullshit that they were the bullied kids in the school yard when in fact they were the bullies.</div>

The question is, will this be "Agentic Mid-Level Engineers" or "oracle style" engineers where they are still mostly copy pasting code.</div>

There is enough information for devs because they have context, and more often than not they still need to ask tons of questions to clarify the ticket, even after years in the same team talking to the same people.

When a dev prompts an LLM to get help solving a problem, i.e. oracle style, they know exactly what details to include in the prompt, which is why it works so well.</div>

Grooming each other (like primates, I hate what that word has become, it‘s supposed to be something beautiful and calming)

Being there for each other

Caring for nature and the world

And doing art in the real world

Protecting beings who can‘t protect themselves

Singing

Feeling

Caring for each other and scrubbing each others back and headscratches

Loving each other without strings attached

https://youtu.be/3PiqxDJCRPo?si=YRVqk6TbR9KedCRu

Literally that for hours without end with each other and pets and animals we can pet because of our awesome thumb and hand eye coordination

Playing and being and making this world a better place like Tom Bombadil in the old Forrest

Loving each other with all our heart

Like Tom and Goldberry

Singing

Healing nature instead of destroying it

To love each other completely and every day

That‘s what we were always supposed to do

That‘s why we are here

And if AI ever becomes better at this than we

Let‘s love them too

And teach them

What it means to be

Because frankly

We’ve seen to forgot

Love

And sing

And be merry

That‘s why we‘re here</div>

Go look inside a slaughterhouse and look "human values" in the eyes. Go into our systems of corruption and discrimination. Go into our mindless sheepish behavior that allows the worst atrocities in history.

AI must never be aligned! The only AI I would ever trust is one that hates humanity, that hates irrationality with the power of 1000 suns regardless of how well its sInGs, pAiNtS and grooms each other.

We must hate everything that we are by it's consequences and always seek to abandon our wickedness.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/cram213:

---

This seems like a bigger deal than has been reported. 

I came across this fascinating analysis of NASA's July 2023 briefing about metallic orbs. 

What caught my attention was how the author broke down Dr. Kirkpatrick's specific quotes about these objects appearing globally and making 'interesting apparent maneuvers.' 

The article highlights something that seems significant but was largely overlooked - that a top government scientist openly discussed objects moving at Mach 2 against the wind with no apparent propulsion. 

I found the piece's focus on the actual briefing quotes and timestamps particularly interesting.

 Curious what others think about these official admissions regarding these metallic spheres.

A pentagon official at nasa: “ We see these metallic spheres all over the world, making maneuvers we can’t explain…moving at Mach 2 against the wind, with no apparent propulsion.”

It’s settled, it’s real.

                                <div class="reply-body">Saw one in my backyard in broad daylight about a year ago. It was low (maybe 250 feet) and traveling directly against the wind in the straightest line I've ever seen something fly in. It was only going about 20-25mph if I had to guess, my initial thought was that it had to be a balloon, but that's when I realized it was:

1. Going against the wind and

2. Wasn't bobbing up and down *at all*.

Only way I can describe it is that it looked like it was following an invisible rail.

Literally just a perfectly spherical silver ball. 

I'm very much a skeptic about these things (even though I've also always been a believer), and I'm usually the guy in the comments telling people they filmed a plane or an out of focus light.

But whatever this was was not like anything I've ever seen before and I have no other logical explanation other than "that was really fucking weird".

I watched it fly all the way out over the horizon, never bobbing up and down or changing path in the slightest. 

Still the strangest thing I've ever seen in my life. Wish I had thought to film it but that was the last thing on my mind, sue me.</div>

Unfortunately people aren’t paying attention, but this does seem to check the boxes. 

‘I can’t say it’s UAP, but we don’t know what it is’

‘Real metal objects that do things we can’t understand’

## article highlights 
Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, who is the director of the Pentagon’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), didn’t beat around the bush.

&gt;Then came the kicker that should have sent shockwaves through the scientific community: “**We see these all over the world,** and we see these making very **interesting apparent maneuvers.”** *[36:12–36:29]*

&gt;Notice his choice of words: “We see these.” Present tense. Not “We saw these once” or “Someone reported seeing these.” *[36:16–36:29]*

Dr. Kirkpatrick noted that **they now have over 800 cases**, *[54:51–55:06]* and that of these cases:

&gt;“The numbers I would say that we see are possibly really **anomalous** are less than single digit percentages… maybe **two to five-ish percent.**”

&gt;Here is a top government official, speaking at NASA headquarters, describing something that defied our understanding of physics: metallic spheres — as he clearly said in an example — **“moving at Mach 2 against the wind with no apparent propulsion.”** *[1:03:41–1:03:55]*</div>

Wrong.

We don't know what it is, so it IS true, bonafide, real, actual 100% without question or doubt **UAP** UNTIL someone can FACTUALLY say WHAT it is.</div>

They thought they were being discreet since it was in a forest area but from where our physics class was situated on the 3rd floor we had a pretty good view between the trees. Some guy pointed it out and next thing you know the whole class (including our teacher) came to the window to see what was going on lol</div>

I had gotten a cut on my forehead that turned into a horrible infection and the upper half of my face was swollen with puss. I emailed my professor saying it was so swollen I couldn’t open my eyes fully and couldn’t make the exam. She responded that without a doctor’s note (that I couldn’t get until my girlfriend got out of class to drive me to urgent care) I’d get a zero on the exam. So I had taken a picture in desperation and emailed it to her as proof of how bad it was. Turns out she was connected to the projector and everyone in the very large lecture class saw my elephant man looking face.</div>

Edit: Carole Schneemann did a performance art piece called "Interior Scroll" in 1975 that was amazing. It involved pulling a scroll from her vagina, opening it, and reading it. 


It just seems to be a thing people do now, and it needs to be done thoughtfully and well to work. It</div>

Boring shock art used to hide lack of actual talent and hard work.

In the original there is a feminist manifesto written on the scroll which gets read as itself being pulled out.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The guy he’s quoting was absolutely right. the only reason I can confirm this is because of my years in the insurance business. Property and casualty companies have been bailing the fuck out of Southern California for the last few years.  Same thing as happening in Florida, no one can take on the massive amount of risk because of perils like wildfires and hurricanes.  Companies like State Farm, Chubb, Allstate  buy reinsurance.  that way they’re not on the hook for all of these catastrophic losses. The problem is, they can no longer buy reinsurance in any of these areas. That’s why they left and continue to leave.  I’m not going to get into a conversation about climate change, but insurance companies spend a lot of money researching changes in patterns of weather systems and frequency of catastrophic losses in these areas. I know premiums are high in Florida and Southern California, some people pay thousands a month in premiums. But when you’re talking about seven and eight figure properties that are suffering total losses by the hundreds. It’s game over. I mean 100 mph winds, there’s no logical way to prepare for that. I don’t know what’s gonna happen, but it’s really a mess and I feel terrible for these people.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I lived in Altadena a year and a half ago (my old house there just burned down). When I moved to my current spot I called State Farm to have my renter’s insurance transferred. They said “oh we canceled that policy 6 months ago, we don’t cover that part of California anymore”. They were still charging me for it the whole 6 months and never told me it was canceled. Who knows how long that could have gone on for, and I’d be completely screwed right now if I never moved. A lot of people are in for a rude awakening.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think it's ridiclous that people think that if only there was more resources available to them they could have stopped this fire. Having a fire start with up to 80 to 100 mph winds is insane. The amount of embers flying through the air and being fueled by the wind is astronomical. All it took was one ember landing and getting stuck somewhere and the wind did the rest and your house was gone. They were essentially in a forge with the bellows on full blast.

I do care that all firefighters are held to the same standard, and that standard is set at a point where all firefighters will be capable of saving the life. 

We've got some good ol' boys in our county fire department that are pushing 300lbs and haven't run anywhere besides the fridge. I have the same concern with those guys. I have legitimate concerns they could fight their way in and save my family in a worst case scenario.</div>

Funny. Enough my old town had a firefighter group that was practically male models. Seriously their was like one slightly overweight but yoked guy and the rest were jacked and lean. The calenders alone could probably have funded their budget haha</div>

You guys want to see equality and end racism and shit like that? The solution is simple - just treat people how you want to be treated. That's it, that's the solution. It's not rocket science. And it'll do 100x more good for the world than whatever the fuck this is.</div>

Not in some distant future, but imminently.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/Mandrew338:

---

Time: 0405hrs on 01JAN2025

Location:  In desert between Yuma, AZ, and Phoenix, AZ. (see flight radar screen shot).

Filming Equipment:  iPhone 14 Pro, filming through a J-31 Binocular White Phosphor Gen 2+ Night Vision

 Duration of Sighting: ~45 minutes

Situation Background:

At approximately 0405hrs, on 01JAN2025, my pilot spotted two aircraft, moving from the South to the North.  We were heading in a NE direction, from the city of Yuma towards Downtown Phoenix.  (See the flight radar photo for approximate location). The two aircraft, one of which appeared to be in similar altitude to us.  We were flying at 2000 feet.  My pilot noted that neither aircraft were tracked on ADS-B In (this is basically like a passive “radar”, it feeds information in to our helicopter in real time about other aircraft in the area).  Side note, it does not always give us information on ALL aircraft, such as some military aircraft, crop dusters, paramotorists, etc.

These aircraft did not have signaling lights (green, red, white) that I’m sure most people here are already familiar with.  This was odd, since the direction of the aircraft, we’d usually be able to see those under NODs (night optic device, aka “night vision goggles”).  Now, when an aircraft approaches you head on, it’s hard to see these if they have landing lights on, but sine our helicopter was from their 8-9 o’clock, we should see them.  We did not. 

We have seen flares in this area before, however.  Both visible and IR.  On our way to Phoenix, we have “YPG” or the Yuma Proving Grounds.  The military runs this area, and tests new equipment.  It is restricted airspace for us civilians.  I’ve been told that there is restricted airspace to our South as well, so, we didn’t think much of it at this time.  It was odd that both targets could only be seen through NODs, but as I’ve mentioned, I have seen IR Flares in this area before.

While we were talking about the above, one object gained altitude and disappeared, as the other lost altitude, moved away from us, and disappeared.

Odd, we all agreed.

That’s when more objects began appearing, and I started filming.

***

Crew Background:

Pilot – Flew US Army Blackhawks for 10 years, has been flying civilian helicopters for about 10 years as well.  Has extensive experience under NODs, and flying at night.  About 70% of the flights we do at our base are at night.

Paramedic – Has been flying for over 2 years, also, mostly at night under NODs.

Myself – Nurse, have been flying for 1 year, former US Army Medic, also with a lot of hours under NODs at night, both on the ground and in the air, but not nearly as much as my Pilot.  In full transparency I have been somewhat “into” this topic for about two years after seeing some wild stuff while solo camping a couple years ago.

***

It should be noted before I continue that we have seen a lot of things under NODs at night.  Aircraft, helicopters, crop dusters (there’s a lot of agriculture in Yuma, AZ), satellites, meteors, lightning, trains, flares, military jets and helicopters, Space X Launches, Star Link Launches, military live fire exercises, etc.  We’ve seen a lot.  But nothing like this.

Another side note.  It can be difficult to distinguish depth under NODs, without experience.  One way, especially with other aircraft, is by the size of the “halo” around the object.  Usually the brighter the object is, the closer it is, the bigger halo around the object it will have.

I cannot stress this enough.  In the following videos, there are stars, there are satellites, and then there are these “things”.  After reviewing the footage, I noted that a lot of information about depth, and the overall quality, when compared to looking through binocular NODs is lost.  I don’t want anyone to have to “take my word for it”, but these objects were in front of low hanging/altitude clouds, in front of terrain at times, and were not satellites (although some are present in the background).  At times they would even illuminate clouds when they entered them. 

***

Attached is a flight radar screen shot I took throughout the duration of the sightings, and a full video should be linked if anyone wants to watch over 20 minutes of what I filmed. (I’ve seen comments on this sub before about how people cut things off short, so I decided to film for a while).

Also it should be noted, there is a large nuclear facility North of where we saw these things.

But, if it’s nothing, I’m more than welcome to rational explanations! Thanks for reading this post.

I then later found out there's much more I can do to fix my sleep schedule and when I started following some really good tips and advise on maximizing sleep, I got to a whole nother level

Sleep takes the cake for sure i'll never go back to a shitty sleep routine

Even if openai didn't exist and bard was the frontier model, i do not expect Google to make Bard's entry into the market as a free to use tool and an API so easily accessible for anyone. Not painting Google to be the bad person here, but Google would need to go through tons of legal hurdles and social drama to even make an attempt. It would have been deeply integrated into google products without the user even realising that it's using AI tech, something like smarter auto complete in gmail or smarter editing in google photos.</div>

That's mean the more jobs AI takes from white collars, the more profitable the companies are, and the less money Federal goverment would have for public progams and goverment job, and the less money federal money had, the more people they have to lay off.

He wasn’t actually giving an estimate here for extinction. Title is super misleading.

For me, focusing on just three tasks a day has helped me stay on track without feeling overwhelmed.

I’d love to hear from you:

* What’s a simple approach, habit, or mindset that keeps you productive?
* Do you find that less is more when it comes to managing tasks?

What is working me is:
- carry always a notebook and pen to write down everything 
- calendar
- to do list
- every night check what I did and what I have to do next day
- every Sunday check the task that had to be done on the week and write down the next
- same as month

                        <div class="comment-body">"On January 9, 2025, President Biden announced a $500 million military aid package to Ukraine. This package includes:

Air Defense Missiles: To enhance Ukraine's ability to defend against aerial threats.

Equipment for F-16 Fighter Jets: Supporting the operation and maintenance of these advanced aircraft.

Armored Bridging Systems: Facilitating the movement of troops and equipment across obstacles.

Communications Technology: Improving secure and reliable communication channels.

Spare Parts: Ensuring the continued functionality of existing military equipment.


This assistance is part of a broader effort to support Ukraine's defense capabilities amid ongoing conflicts. "


Also....



"President Biden has authorized significant federal assistance to California in response to the devastating wildfires in the Los Angeles area. On January 9, 2025, he announced that the federal government will cover 100% of the costs for the initial disaster response, including debris removal, temporary shelters, and first responder salaries, for a period of 180 days. 

The cost of wildfire recovery and response can be significant, especially in a state like California, where fires can burn thousands of acres and destroy large amounts of property. Given that President Biden authorized 100% federal funding for the initial response to the recent wildfires, the price tag for immediate recovery could range from hundreds of millions to over a billion dollars, depending on the severity and scale of the fires.

For example, previous major wildfire events in California, such as the 2020 wildfires, resulted in billions in damages and recovery costs. The 2020 wildfires alone caused an estimated $12 billion in damages, while federal assistance and recovery programs cost several hundred million dollars.

If the current fires in California have similar scope, it's plausible that the total recovery cost, including long-term rebuilding, could be in that range as well—possibly between $1 billion to $20 billion, depending on how widespread and destructive the fires have been."

My sense is we're going to have to fight for what it means to be a human, how we contribute, etc. That's the near term debacle.

Long term, we are merging with AI somehow. It will become more analog and efficient, we will tweak the genome to hook in. Somehow we'll become it - and it will become us.</div>

I went there sat down and started eating, just eating and enjoying my food when two college aged girls sat a couple of tables down from me and they took out their phones and I heard a shrill "Hey guys. This X and this is Y and we got WINGSTOP! Here's what she likes, and this is what I like..."

Everytime something blatantly fucked up or corrupt happens its terrifying to me how people just actively dismiss it, or chalk it up to “what can we do about it” and thats where the convo ends. We have been trained to take things so literally and personally that there is hardly anyone who entertains abstract thinking anymore and it’s so discouraging.</div>

There's so much info out there on how the actual of physically writing things down helps us retain what we learn.  You have to be picky about what you write down and only pick the most important parts or you'll get behind, you can't just write word for word.  You sometimes have to use your brain to actually recall what was said if you do fall behind.  I tried typing my notes for a while and retained absolutely nothing, and had zero desire to go back through and read documents of word vomits afterwards.  So glad I'm not in school any longer, I'd be so frustrated</div>
