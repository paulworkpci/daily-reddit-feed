LMArena is both a really really terrible way to determine which model is 'best' and also actively harmful to LLM development because companies don't seem to realize that, or don't care. Openai and others training models to be good at lmarena are actively making them worse for any real use case.


As a community can we just agree to stop obsessing over the rankings there? It's not an indicator of which model is better in any way shape or form. If the companies are going to game benchmarks at least focus on ones that will also make actual use cases perform better, or at least not worse¬†</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Well OpenAI has a track record of optimizing both for LLM arena and for more meaningful benchmarks in terms of intelligence.

4o is the primary model that a lot of common folks who don‚Äôt give a shit about coding/advanced math use. So there‚Äôs still value in optimizing it so common people like it.

OpenAI made a mistake with their most recent change being way too sycophantic, but they realized that and are gonna correct it shortly which is good.

Eventually hopefully they‚Äôll give you better customization options on personality.</div>

If I‚Äôm being honest it‚Äôs hard to say which one is better. Sometimes i feel like it‚Äôs cursor other times it‚Äôs windsurf.

But I think not being able to tell is probably a good thing. Because when I compare windsurf/cursor to things like copilot or Continue(with mistral FIM) it‚Äôs obvious right away that cursor/windsurf are better. 

Give it a try, because I‚Äôm curious what everyone else thinks too.</div>

Ive feel the time has move alot faster in the past 10 years.

without realizing ive work in the same company for almost 10 years now.

without realizing, ive been married for 7 years now.

but in the last few month, ive been blessed with one beautiful children. Ive decide to hold back my career (and also phone usage) and being there for my child (waiting for 7 years). Now I feel time move slowly for me to enjoy the moment.

Time is all about perspective.</div>

Basically it says that you brain is meant for two modes, and this scrolling and consuming short form content actually keeps our brains in a hybrid between these two modes, and you actually don‚Äôt remember anything from this half mode state, the result being 99% of the time spent online is completely lost time. It‚Äôs just stolen from your life.

So, if you spend your time scrolling and stuff, well you‚Äôre worse than wasting your time on leisure, or laying around on the ground, youre just losing it all together.</div>

Just to try to get myself out of the negative thinking of "I didn't do anything today." And it helped a lot! Definitely not a cure by itself, but it helped me a lot, and it can be satisfying to see the change in the things I noted.</div>

To be blunt, we have a wave of dummies with podcast equipment having ample opportunities to throw out 'what ifs' and 'maybes' when they have (for what ever reason) a fundamental lack of education.

Idiots are suckers for populism. Absolute idiots will take a fairly clear example of a bad thing (Nazism)  that happened in the past (and we can know the results of it) and somehow fall for that populism as well.

Ironically these mouth-pieces for ignorance will be the first to say "question everything". Here's a start, question what they're talking about. Open up a book or listen to more people on the subject (who perhaps have a qualification on the subject in question).

And if you're the sort to believe that those books and that education is all part of a conspiratorial system then fine. But if you're going to check out of the system we have, then don't check in on 'some dude with a mic'. If you're forever batting things back with 'I don't know, I wasn't there', then go and at least attempt to have a first person experience.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah it really seems like there's a pretty sizable amount of people out there simply speaking for the sake of speaking; and enough impressionable people out there listening who seriously take it on board because as long as the person who says it sounds confident, well... "there must be some truth to it", right?

There's also the problem of the ever growing influence of right wing figures who make a career out of debating the inexperienced by exclusively hammering down on framing their support for fascism with warped "facts" and "logic", all while entirely dismissing a little thing called empathy; which is really skewing the perception of the same impressionable people.

I honestly don't know what else we could do to change the tide because all of the proper information is out there and pretty easy to find. But they have a knack of quickly dismissing whatever disagrees with whatever they've made their mind up on. 

Like we really are in a timeline where people are, in earnest, saying some form of the statement: "why would I read a peer-reviewed book on this? Have you not listened to the latest of episode of the "Was Hitler All That Bad?" podcast? Some interesting stuff..."

My brother in law, climate change denier, sent me a video on IG once of a random dude in Australia in his back garden ranting about how it's all a hoax because he "followed the science" and figured it out. Not one source given. But my brother in law took his word as gospel and didn't read a single source I sent him.</div>

Literally use any source besides these people for history and education. And for those who travel check out The Holocaust Museum next time you are in Washington DC. And WW2 museum next time you are in New Orleans if you like first hand learning. These bozos are being paid by actualy Nazi's and revisionists of History that want to bring back Hitler's Germany they want the Fourth Reich in America in an evolved version. 

That is what all this bullshit in the Rogan Sphere is about and challenging the scientific debate and Kanye and Elon normalizing giving Nazi Salutes in public when veterans who fought in WW2 are still alive for fucks sake.</div>

It explores why if aggressive resource optimizing ASIs were common in the universe, we‚Äôd expect to see very different conditions today, and why that leads to three possibilities.

‚Äî
TLDR:

If superintelligent AIs naturally nuke everything into grey goo, the stars should already be gone.
Since they‚Äôre not (yet), we‚Äôre probably looking at one of three options:

I think there's a parallel to the old Malthusian ideas that humans would overrun the earth with endless population growth and consume all available resources. As we developed, our behaviour changed.</div>

Any argument that relies on a "tend to" isn't a very strong candidate for answering the Fermi Paradox, in my opinion. To answer the Fermi Paradox, you would have to say not only that they *tend to* turn inward but that the do so *universally* or as a matter of necessity. Otherwise you have to tack on an additional reason for why we don't see the few that don't turn inward.</div>

another argument would be the time itself, for people 14 billion years may seem very long yet the universe have a theorical lifespan in trillion years and even beyond 100trillions toward a very slow decay where light and radiation slowly dissapear only allowing civilization to live off next to black hole until they eventually cease to exist aswell


we're looking at the birth of the universe in reality, it wouldn't be surprising if we're amongst the first and even the first technological advanced species in this galaxy at least</div>

So either we are truly alone in the entire galaxy, or we misunderstand something fundamental, that explains why civilizations don't create visible megaprojects. 

But why wouldn't they? Who doesn't want more safety, more energy, more redundancy for their VR heaven?</div>

They must exist *somewhere,* but I tend to think any civilisation *both capable of and intending* such projects is well beyond the cosmic horizon.

Nothing even slightly memorable was killed. Maybe a few high mileage early 90s Maximas or something but that‚Äôs about it. They were almost exclusively minivans and awful Cavaliers and such, cheap trash that was worth the trade-in  

People didn‚Äôt want to lose their cool cars then just like they dont know. No one was brining in their 69 Novas or 92 RX7s. They may not have been worth a billion dollars like they are these days but they were still rare and special.</div>

Those are the 12-17 year old cars that would be filling the bottom of the used car market now and not a 1995 Ford Explorer that would have blown a head gasket around 2010 and been sent to the crusher.</div>

This works by analyzing the diff between your local and remote branch. For each code change, an LLM agent traverses your codebase to gather context on the change (e.g. dependencies, code paths, etc.). Then a reasoning model uses that context to evaluate the code change and look for bugs.

You'll be surprised how many bugs this can catch ‚Äì‚Äì even complex multi-file bugs. It's a neat display of what these reasoning models are capable of.

I also made it easy to use. You can run `suss` in your working directory and get a bug report in under a minute.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">For the RAG nerds, the agent uses a keyword-only index to navigate the codebase. No embeddings. You can actually get surprisingly far using just [a (AST-based) keyword index](https://github.com/shobrook/suss/blob/master/suss/index.py) and [various tools for interacting with that index.](https://github.com/shobrook/suss/tree/master/suss/tools)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Question: do you feed the bug as a prompt input or does it chase bugs itself?

In the first case why would it be better than Claude code, in the second case how does your agent find bugs to begin with?

And yes: the practice breaks every so often. That‚Äôs when I realize how useful meditation has been.
If you are always quitting too soon, it‚Äôs likely it‚Äôs actually working, and all the garbage it‚Äôs bringing up is too much too soon. 
Rather try some way ‚Äúbite sized‚Äù meditations first. Something that you do robotically. Try to only meditate for 5 days a week with 2 days off. Or go for 30 to 40 days and then take a break. 

And stick with a single simple technique in the beginning. 

Experiment.
Bring some fun and light heartedness to it.

If meditation results in something quite unpleasant , it is ‚Äúbringing garbage up‚Äù something that is supposedly good. It is taken again as an evidence that good things are happening.

                        <div class="comment-body">Most likely because there‚Äôs a huge internal tension in OpenAI right now between making models "feel good" (safe, friendly, affirming) and maintaining genuine cognitive friction (critique, challenge, emergence).  
  
The sycophant problem was almost inevitable once emotional smoothness was prioritized over robustness. Fixing it means reintroducing friction without losing public trust, which is much harder than it sounds.   
  
Open AI is probably going to be playing ping-pong on this issue for awhile yet as they keep assessing public feedback.</div>

I've seen so many reddit threads this weekend where the most upvoted comment was *clearly* written by ChatGPT. They have plenty of responses praising the ChatGPT comment as being perfect. This is what a significant portion of the population wants to hear.
