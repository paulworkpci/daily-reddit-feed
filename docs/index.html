There are barely any major articles written about it. I've noticed how similar the altered states of consciousness and loss of ego can be to the effects of psychedelics. It's considered common sense (or at least it should be) to avoid psychedelics—and any hallucinogens, for that matter—if you're predisposed to such ment...</div>

It does interest me how the two are similar, as well as those who have a knock you on your ass spiritual experience that creates a state of psychosis- like symptoms often referred to as "spiritual psychosis ".

But it doesn't appear to be as delusional or dangerous,  but it is interesting that it seems to affect people like that. 

To reach a psychadelic- like state seems to take a lot of practice/ deep meditation,  so it probably isn't quite as dangerous as a psychadelic that just rockets you to another state of consciousness, but people still need to be aware.</div>

You basically have to center your life around meditation for years.

There are quite a few people - particularly young men - using all sorts of drugs, then doing meditation, and then getting pretty spaced out. It's not as uncommon as it sounds.

But the randomness, absurdity and frequency of AI's use of what was once limited to very expensive tech has made for some very new experiences.

                        <div class="comment-body">This is obviously relevant to the sub because Joe is obsessed with Congressional stock trading when corruption in politics is discussed. Several prominent Republicans have come out in favor of the bill, as have most Democrats, but the disaster for Trump is that even Nancy Pelosi is backing the bill. That's why Trump is so furiously attacking Hawley, he gave even Pelosi the upper hand on him in this debate.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Why does the statement "we have begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves" need to be qualified with "begun to see glimpses". Are they improving themselves or not? If they are: Why are we beginning to see glimpses? If they *are* improving themselves, then the correct statement is: "We have observed our AI systems improving themselves."

The reason why you qualify a statement like that is so you can walk it back and not be called a liar. Plain and simple.</div>

I recommend asking them if they have a wishlist somewhere so you know by the time you’re ready to buy something, it’s up to date.

I had no plan b because I had to have complete privacy. They could have sent me a screenshot of their Wi-Fi and it wouldn't mattered it was because where I was in the hotel.</div>

I suspect people are ripping out green code with the early models and then as it grows and requirements get stricter find that these things are not so hot at code maintenance.

Estimate how long the task will take you manually. Flip a coin: heads, use AI; tails, don’t. Track the time it takes. If AI really saves you time, it’ll show up in the numbers. If there’s no difference (or you’re actually slower) that’s worth knowing too.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You're not wrong, but the video cuts way short. It put the hamper in front of the door. Will it attempt to remove it before closing the door? Will it even close the door? What about adding detergent? Can it remember what settings we want? What about actually pressing the buttons? What even prompted it to "autonomously" do the laundry? Is it able to go back and check on its own after setting an internal timer? What about dealing with the clothes after? So many things that aren't answered and everyone is eating up this video. I'm a huge proponent for technology, but what's the difference between what I saw and an "autonomous" assembly arm that gets everything prompted to it besides the ability to walk around?

Just like ChatGPT and the likes, this will only improve, but I hate how the guy was acting like it was already doing everything on its own when the video was clearly cut short because it was about to stand there doing nothing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">We've been increasingly isolating ourselves in cultivated bubbles of self interest in all facets of life, including entertainment. 

Fandoms will increasingly desire *not sharing* what they like with the masses, as that simply invites all the vitriol and nitpicking that we currently see trending. If you enjoyed the recent season of Last of Us for example, you weren't exactly able to share that enjoyment with others online. 

Add to this the 'ownership' feeling that will come from sharing 'your' creation with a small group of likeminded people and we'll see the death of entertainment for the masses within our lifetimes.</div>

Edit: very funny people replying to me like “Aktually if you took all his money it would be like $250/person” or whatever like that’s the kind of resources people need lol. He can make and distribute millions of cars, revamp a global messaging app, and ship products to space and back, you really think people criticizing him simply want to take his wealth and give people gift cards to McDonald’s or something?

Edit 2: a lot of odd sentiment calling me ignorant. Pretty odd ngl. Elon has more resources at the tip of his fingers and has refused to do anything for hunger? People talking about government spending is wasteful and hen he has received billions and billions of subsidies? He’s been making promises for literally decades that are either extremely late, underwhelming, or both?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Sounds about right.

Yearly price increases, making the CVT mandatory, and now removing the base trim will do that.

Despite what this subreddit thinks, it seems like people don't like not having things like push button start as Subaru has pretty much killed off every single trim that still offered keyed ignitions.</div>

Subaru has now killed the base model for all of their non SUV/crossover models.

The Impreza, WRX, and BRZ all no longer have a base model for 2026, along with the Legacy being killed off.

For the Impreza it starts at the Impreza Sport, for the BRZ it starts at the BRZ Premium, and for the WRX it starts at the WRX Premium.</div>
