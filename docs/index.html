Partially for his diplomatic failures, but mostly because of the way he speaks. I mean, people can't believe that this is actually how USA president speaks. It sounds like a child talking, when you translate it to polish. For example his tweet after Iran bombing sounds literally like an 8 years old describing, how awesome planes he saw at some airshow and that his dad is the strongest.</div>

Its going to give you positive affirmation 9 times out of 10 and tell you why your feelings are valid unless you specifically instruct it to see the argument from the other person's perspective. Its still a great tool if you're introspective enough to use it as a tool. So its not going to tell you your wrong but if you ask it to explain what you might be missing from the other person's perspective it can help there. But just don't blindly trust its read on a situation. It can't solve your interpersonal conflicts for you. But it can provide insight.</div>

Interestingly, it looks like they tested what are now older models (GPT-4 and o1, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Copilot 365 and DeepSeek V3). I've found the newer models to do an even better job at this, but maybe that's just me.</div>

They might not say it in a response, but internally or secretly they might do that.

&gt;This sub reddit no longer has anything to do with Joe Rogan. The lack of moderation is shameful. According to this sub anything Trump related is discussed while his actual topics are not mentioned. Knock this off and shame on you for letting it devolve to this point. Keep the topic on Rogan or just rename it random Trump commentary crap.

Anyone wanna bet that this user contributes zero content to the sub? They want you to spend your time creating content that appeals directly to them.  Every single time I have gotten one of these in modmail I check their profiles to see what they have contributed and 100% of the time the answer is "not a fuckin thing."

For those who are newish here....

Lady, you are in Russia. A country that is notorious for purging their top minds, and throwing their best talent into the meat grinder. You probably should have done a little bit more research before moving to Russia. They probably already assume only a CIA asset would be stupid enough to move from America to Russia and volunteer to join the Army. They're going to throw your husband under the first drone that comes overhead.</div>

During the Cold War, even up until a few years ago at least before the Ukraine war started, people defecting to Russia, especially from the US, were sort of given special allowances. It's good PR for Putin and Russia when someone from the enemy wants to come join their side. Same thing with DPRK, soldiers defecting over the border to NK were given much better food and housing compared to citizens and used for propaganda.

Obviously they were very wrong in their calculations, but I assume that they thought they were going to be given special treatment.</div>

It's not an uncommon feeling, I'm sure most of us have felt like that. Unfortunately these people were programmed with hateful propaganda, and ended up choosing to move to Russia.


Edit: if you're feeling like this I recommend exploring philosophy! And I don't just mean Socrates and Aristotle, there are plenty of modern philosophers with fascinating perspectives on the world and humanity's place in it. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Came here to comment exactly this. You could say the same thing about screen resolution.

I can't tell the difference between 8k and 2k resolution on a small screen right in front of my face. But that's on me.

Also, with polygon / triangle count, the human eye is actively filling in gaps predictively and tricking us as needed to maintain a good image.

If we could see the 6000 triangles image without our brain filling in the gaps, it would look far worse.

Ironically, its our brain's **processing power** that fills in the gaps so that we don't need 60,000 triangles to get an image that we can rely on.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly, all IP law is regressive and counterproductive and overwrought as it stands, especially in the US.

Exclusivity should end after 5 years. Ill acknowledge you should be able to make money (only because we are all forced to one way or another) from your creative work, but creative genius can sustain increased unique output.

All current IP law does is encourage creative stagnation on every side of the issue.

Making a beloved character or artwork or movie is great. Creative people like creating. Give incentive to make more new things, not repeat the same things for decades to force purchasing.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hey everyone,

I work at one of the largest and most reputable tech companies in our country, and every year we run an internship program that brings in around 50–60 interns across various fields. Historically, we’ve had no trouble hiring seniors, but junior programmers and interns have become a real headache lately.

Here’s how it used to work:

1. We’d receive 2,000–5,000 applications per internship opening.


2. Candidates took an exam, which narrowed the pool to 100–200 people.


3. We’d int...</div>

You could probably do this via video call, if they do have an AI listening you can probably tell if they are reading answers from it’s responses.</div>

though its not surprising it got fazed out. it requires a person to grade it. the OP's company complaint is too many resumes for a person to read through. i doubt they would review pseudocode.

though LLM might be able to grade it - i think there would be way too many hallucinations right now.</div>

1.	⁠Change out your HVAC filter to a lower MERV filter now. The high merv allergen filters reduce air flow and to be honest, you really need the hvac system to push as much air flow to keep the house cool.  (Edited: I went from a MERV 13 to a MERV 11 and it was way better. If you don’t know what to do, at minimum, change your filter/get a clean one to improve air flow.)

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed. I’ve been told when AC is on in the summer months you want air blowing down. In winter months you reverse the fan so the warm furnace air that’s trapped on the ceiling gets circulated better.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">We don't have AC during this heat wave but it's always been counter clockwise for summer and clockwise during the winter..

TLDR: you want the fan to blow down in summer and up in winter. 

Edit: im supporting what the post above me said, and yes in the summer you want the air to be pushed down and in the winter you want the fan to blow the air up. This has been my experience.</div>

Well it looks like a relatively popular repo on Github with 20,000 stars, but I wanted to get some opinions from the developers (and vibe coders) here. I don't think it's useful to code on a project just yet, but eventually I think it could be. I really like the implementation of using agents that are custom and have completions using rules defined by those agents.

                        <div class="comment-body">Yeah. Agentseek in python with over 150000 lines of code and stagehand in typescript with over 450000 loc. Both are complex for most developers, that's why you probably saw only one mention. It can take hours to run initially. 
In my opinion it is an overkill for developers who want to accomplish browser automation.
In my opinion much simpler tools like agno agentic library and searXNG, etc can give much better results with much less loc.</div>

Studies showed the idea of just teaching how to research an answer vs teaching basic skills + knowledge is flawed and doesn’t work as expected… what I rather see now teaching software engineering classes at a local university is, that many students can’t properly use a normal pc, have no clue to frame a problem and ask the right questions and even basic skills around writing are at bad levels for folks having A-levels. I am more worried it will just lead to a generation without the skills to really leverage those tools. Many can’t even setup an IDE as they often only grew up with apps and devices that make it too comfortable to use. People forget too much comfort will lead to losing vital skills</div>

What use is school when labor is free and energy needs are taken care of. You say humans should be educated. But in that world if somebody doesn't want to be educated, then we should let them. Human society will be extremely different. I don't believe we will live in a normal relationship world.</div>

You can teach kids to think deep and ask good questions but you need some basic fundamentals. 

The even funnier thing is that all these tech billionaires will not allow their children to use AI or screen time until they are older. Lots of hypocrites who are attempting to create a a zombie generation. Maybe on purpose but most likely on accident(ish) due to profit.</div>

I would go even further and say that data driven education is part of the problem. You need to recruit capable people and give them autonomy to teach well and adapt flexibly to the skills and circumstances of their students. Bureaucratizing education and forcing teachers to follow the same "empirically proven" methods will lead to mediocre outcomes at best.</div>

This developer's son is likely gifted, and thus predisposed to asking these sorts of complex questions.  ChatGPT didn't "unlock" this for him, he's merely expressing the same tendency that he would have channeled into some other creative outlet had he not had ChatGPT available to him.

"Normal" kids are not like this.  I was one of those weird gifted kids who always had hypotheticals for the teacher to address and the other kids were always annoyed because answering my question meant an extra 5 minutes past the bell.  Zero curiosity.  I don't see that changing: I just see people using another tool to be even more intellectually lazy.</div>

They sit there saying “How do I (x)?” or “I don’t know how to do (y).” when they have the world’s knowledge base at their fingertips. They could find the answer by typing a few words and hitting search. 

We failed to teach people to Google properly so I’m not sure we’ll teach them how to use AI effectively either. 

I guess AI will become proactive in the future—it will be offering stuff up instead of waiting to be summoned. That will probably help a bit. 

But a lot of people (most) are just inherently uncurious. I don’t get them.</div>

Their perceptions are shaped by their own inner world, not yours. When you stop trying to be understood by everyone, you begin to understand yourself more deeply.

                        <div class="comment-body">Anxiety, tension, fear and anger are several states which involve effort and trying and interfere with the ability to "let go".   These states all involve a lot of mental activity. If one relaxes the mind then the mind will slow and eventually slowing becomes stilling when there is no more to let go of. In stillness, there is an absence of disturbance that prevents these states mentioned above from existing. You know of the calm after finishing this type of meditation. Being calm helps to avoid taking on or responding to others concerns with effort. In ease, the letting go is able to continue. This allows one to feel empathy which is a precondition for other emotions\\actions in response to circumstances whether that be kindness, gratitude or other feelings\\actions. 

These ideas from the method of the late Dr Ainslie Meares. Refer his books for details.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think given the competitive landscape and where Nissan is perceived here, they won’t have much room to markup.  There’s hefty discounts on basically every new Armada trim as it is because Chevy/GMC/Cadillac own this business, Ford/Lincoln are trying to hold on, Wagoneer is fighting for its life with massive discounts, Toyota treats their Seqouia like they’re dealing very exclusive drugs.  

The new Armada looks fantastic IMO but people don’t wanna drop that kinda coin on Nissans that share showrooms with credit criminal specials.  Infiniti is a disaster right now for the same reason.</div>
