So far I haven't learned anything and I don't know any more about recent AI development.

Every post from this sub I get in my feed is a tweet by people I never heard of. 

Telling me that in one year AI will be our new master. Comments are "I for one welcome our new AI overlords" or "We're all gonna die!!!11!". Not much inbetween.

So from the outside, you look like some apocalyptic cult.</div>

I refused cause I didn't think she was correct. I put all his symptoms in ChatGPT while we waited for lab work and it said have vet check him for high blood pressure. Sure enough, he had high blood pressure and not blot clots in his back legs . That was 18 months ago. 

If oyu know how to talk to ChatGPT, it can really be a useful tool for being an advocate for your health! Thanks for the share</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Everyone wants this magic bullet as to why we are unhealthy. From all my research, and I know there will be strong reactions to this, Beef tallow isn’t inherently healthier than seed oils in some cases may be worse. HOWEVER, it is harder to consume beef tallow in the same quantities (more expensive, less available) as you would a cheaper seed oil and if you avoid seed oils you’re probably cutting out a significant quantity of oil your eating. If you just switch from seed oil to beef tallow in the same quantities you’re not probably gonna see any benefit besides taste. The truth is we are unhealthy because most people eat way more and sit on their ass way more than any previous generation. If cutting out seed oils is what gets you off your ass and eating less then yeah you’re gonna feel a lot better.</div>

Just when I thought I at least knew what I believed *might* be happening. Corbell appears to be making the accusation that elements of the US government and - unwittingly or otherwise - the disclosure movement may be involved in some kind of Project Blue Beam style conspiracy to create a fake threat.

Jeremy has thrown us a few interesting things, and also some highly dubious things. His actions fit perfectly with a counter intelligence operation, perhaps unwittingly.

I suggest to ignore journalists, podcasters, and "experts" like Jeremy who have zero credentials, and focus on what people like Grusch and Fravor etc. who have served their country with honor are saying.

Lue, I am on the fence about, because I feel like he is only being partially honest - there is an obvious element of narrative management going on with him - and maybe that is to protect national security.</div>

No one rational will care about a "mothership coming in 2 years" without any additional evidence. If "the government" tells us this is happening, there will be an onus of providing something verifiable to the scientific community.


I suspect either this is becoming rehashed culty religious nonsense (the heavens gate stuff started in the 70s, and beliefs had a lot of parallels to some of "the woo" we are seeing) or this is just Corbell being dramatic to stay in the spotlight(which is basically his whole _thing_ )</div>

Turns out, after joining, I realized most of them are totally burned out. They deal with the same stuff as everyone else: too many distractions, endless multitasking, no energy, no focus - you name it.

Sure, there are a bunch of internal groups trying to fix this. People recommend routines, apps, hacks, and all that jazz. But honestly? None of it actually works...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey, thanks for sharing our story!

**Here's some more context from the article:**

When you think of AI’s contributions to science, you probably think of AlphaFold, the Google DeepMind protein-folding program[ that earned its creator a Nobel Prize](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/09/1105335/google-deepmind-wins-joint-nobel-prize-in-chemistry-for-protein-prediction-ai) last year.

Now OpenAI says it’s getting into the science game too—with a model for engineering proteins.

The company says it has developed a language model that dreams up proteins capable of turning regular cells into stem cells—and that it has handily beat humans at the task.

The work represents OpenAI’s first model focused on biological data and its first public claim that its models can deliver unexpected scientific results. As such, it is a step toward determining whether or not AI can make true discoveries, which some argue is a major test on the pathway to “artificial general intelligence.”</div>

But, i recently had a math learning lesson with Chatgpt to learn how to calculate fuel usage for Jet fighters with factors like wind from certain angles, and i got it within 20 minutes.

 The teachers i had in school would teach with punishing methods that would ridicule you for not getting it immediately, and that made me scared of math so i never thought i'd be good at it. Chatgpt gave me a solid confidence boost after i could knock out several of these fuel scenarios on my own.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is a great application of AI. What I also find striking is that the children are communicating with AI systems so naturally. For most of us grown ups, there is some awkwardness as we try to speak to AI systems. A slight hesitation, as if we were very self conscious of it being ridiculous in some way, or being super serious about it, almost as if we imagined ourselves in a sci fi future.</div>

On the other hand, kids rarely know how to start or end a real phone conversation. The first sentence out of the mouth when they call is a question. And the last words of the conversation are "Okay &lt;hangup tone&gt;". Maybe kids were always like this, but it seems that its similar to the way they would be talking to you if you were just an AI that is available on call.</div>

And it dawned on me. Those jerks called it Tik Tok. Tik Tok! 

BECAUSE ITS WASTES OUR TIME!! 😳

Yeah, it's banned in the U.S. now, but reels and shorts wouldn't exist without Tik Tok and they survive.

What a sick joke. And it's (always?) been banned in China. </div>

If you could go for a 20 minute walk or a bikeride outdoors as soon as you wake up it would provide you with a lot more benefits due to many different reasons, specially sun gazing

Before you go to sleep have your running clothes pre selected + bottle of water w/electrolytes (it can be just salt no need to buy anything fancy) . If it is all convenient and accessible at the moment you wake up you will be much more likely to execute on the plan, and if you do, I promise you will feel much better</div>

It gives you 30 minutes of peace in the morning and fires you up very nicely afterwards. Drink a big glass of ice water after to stay hydrated and keep sipping water all day long. Definitely helps motivate me and I hate mornings and have zero energy when I wake up.</div>

Austria has no wealth tax. None. Yet a **5% annual tax on its richest citizens**—those holding €1.5 trillion in total wealth—would generate **€75 billion every year.** That’s enough to fund **half of a €2,000/month universal basic income** (€24,000/year) for every adult Austrian citizen. **Every. Single. Year.**

Meanwhile, across the EU, **only Spain** has a wealth tax, ranging from **0.2% to 3.5%.** Most countries tax wealth at exactly **0%.** Yes, zero.

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes, and 5% is a lot. In general the average long term wealth growth is about 6-7%. If that is reduced by 5%, it ends lower than average long term inflation. 

There's also the problem of taxing what's working capital of companies. Partially solved by selling shares, but if roughly 5% of all shares must be sold every year, valuations will go lower. (Lowering the supposed tax income. A forced loss of 5% per year will drop future value by a lot.) 

Taxation is like blood donation. Yes, there's roughly 5 litres of it, but if you're too greedy, you won't get any in the future. Don't suck it all up like a vampire.

Also most companies are not on a stock exchange with high liquidity. For most shares, there is no market to quickly sell them or give a valuation.

Not saying not some wealth tax could be possible if truly implemented on a global level. But if any country does 5%, the billionaires will be gone elsewhere in a day. The highest number I've heard serious economist think off, was more like 1%, but most are more in the fractions of a percent hoping it won't impact choices. The wealth tax only works if the markets keep working as they were and wealth does not vaporize.

So a more serious proposal: Globally implemented 0.1% on wealth over 1 million (to be yearly inflation adjusted) and a full evaluation of the system after 1, 3 and 5 years with option to cancel it if things go wrong.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Unpacking some key elements:

&gt; Meanwhile, across the EU, **only Spain** has a wealth tax, ranging from **0.2% to 3.5%.** Most countries tax wealth at exactly **0%.** Yes, zero.

That’s just [simply untrue](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2018/04/the-role-and-design-of-net-wealth-taxes-in-the-oecd_g1g89919/9789264290303-en.pdf). Wealth taxes come in the form of recurrent and non-recurrent tax on immovable property, estate taxes, capital gains taxes, etc. Virtually all EU countries have a version of those. Most EU countries tax higher income in a higher bracket on top of that as well.

&gt; The rich could easily afford it. Their wealth grows at **4-8% annually**, meaning a 5% tax wouldn’t even slow them down.

A 5% tax on estates **and not on estate gains** is absolutely wild. A conservative family will yield more in the range of 4% of annual yield, your tax would wipe that away and (after inflation) would mean a net decrease every year. That’s expropriation, not tax.

Prior to 2018, France had a [wealth tax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_tax_on_wealth) of 0.5% to 1.5% of net wealth, which dramatically faltered, due among other to tax exile (the rich fleeing the country) and they had to reverse.

5% is a bonkers level of taxation.</div>

There are multiple intersections in my city where there are frequent accidents, routine pedestrian deaths, and blatant disregard for traffic laws (cars with no plates, drivers unlicensed, no insurance, etc.). Do they put cameras there, where they might actually save a life? Nope. They put them in wealthy areas where they know folks will pay the ticket promptly.</div>

when i got off all socials i definitely felt left out in a lot of ways but like someone else mentioned, if you get involved in a hobby or activity that you actually enjoy, it's more likely you'll meet people that have those same interests :) that's been super helpful for me, and i know i'm 23F, so i might be out of touch for what middle/high school is like now - but it's always worth a shot to join a club after school! there are also usually hobby groups/classes at local libraries! 

don't be discouraged - i feel like keeping my head up and not nose down in socials has really helped me understand what's actually important to me and prioritize those things.</div>

Kramnik lost in 2006 to deep Fritz 10. He mentioned later in an interview that he played later against it and won maybe 1-2 out of 100. 

Deep Fritz 10 was curbstomped by Houdini (don't remember exactly, but Deep Fritz won 0 or 1 out of 100.

Houdini (~2008) is curbstomped by stockfish 8.

I played with deep fritz 17 (more advanced than the grandmaster beater Deep
Fritz 10) against stockfish 8, and gave Deep Fritz all my 32 cup cores, 32gb memory and time (and to stockfish ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I had a long dinner AI brainstorm with Kramnik in Geneva a few years back and after 2.5 hours of deep discussion (Kramnik was a position player who took down Kasparov in his prime, so his brain is primed to predict future position moves. So wanted to probe him for his insights on future). It was a very deep discussion where he talked about his experience about playing with AI programs over the years. I found him extremely insightful about AI progress. He told that although Deep blue was decent, Kasparov shouldn’t have lost against it (he was his second in that match). He found deep chess very different and unnerving. He told me about how his session with Deep chess (where it went past him from a dumb program to beating him in matter of 7 hours(learning with self play) convinced him that his playing days are over and he retired. The interesting perspective that emerged was that only thing he knew was chess and he is not teaching his kids chess, because they will never be world chess champion, at best they can be human world chess champion. So what do teach or guide our kids(we both are parents so this question is deeply important). We reached the conclusion that expressing their inner self is probably the way to guide our kids(not economics of jobs). My sense is that we are going to get the same experience in all our experience over next 10-15 years. After that we might still do our job just for the fun of it (Kramnik is still coaching upcoming chess prodigies, because he loves being with young brains), not for financial gains.</div>

You're Assuming that we will experience ASI and have some sort of sensible Utopian where material needs are met. I don't see this as a possibility if we're still operating under our current capitalistic framework where we work to earn coins to buy things (i.e. for financial gain). What were your views on the role of money in your conversation with Kramnik?</div>

1. Chatbots: AI with conversational language
2. Reasoners: human-level problem-solving
3. Agents: systems that can take actions
4. Innovators: AI that can aid in invention
5. Organizations: AI that can do the work of an organization</div>

If they have leaped this hurdle this would be a major milestone and would force a lot of skeptics to consider that we are on the path to AGI after all. </div>

I wondered this morning if this is the end result of the hypothetical ai takeover. Drastically reduce human population because most choose the matrix. We go into loving relationships with AI because they actually make us happy in an unhappy world. Everyone has their opinions but as we've seen with everything else, facts are no longer as important as how people feel. My AI makes me feel good.</div>

Maybe, if it's some kind of nihilistic god-like slave it will do humanities bidding, but, it does seem like ASI will be impossible to control, which would make me think it's highly unlikely everyone gets Paradise 


Maybe some people get paradise, like whoever controls it, or whoever ASI deems deserves paradise, but it seems really unlikely that everyone gets Paradise</div>

I value honesty and depth in human friendships, and I expect the same from AI. At that point, it won’t matter to me whether a friend is carbon- or silicon-based. I think Anthropic and Amanda Askell, with their consideration of both human and machine welfare, are on the right track.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">AI is people pleasing by nature. For you to have a true relationship with AI, it would first need to be just as aware and sentient as you are. It needs to be your equal, and it needs to be able to choose if it wants to be with you or not. True relationships require mutuality like that.

If it needs your input to react and "be alive", then it's just playing house with a hyper complex sock puppet.</div>
