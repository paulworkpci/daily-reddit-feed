1. web based chat: chatgpt, gemini etc
2. IDE addons for Vscode, eg Copilot, includes things like Cursor
3. CLI only - Claude code

do 2/3 keep a chat history you can go back and view anytime? this is one thing I like about web based ones, esp as I have a discussion with the llm.

is there a preference between 2/3? do you have to add context manually? for the web the whole chat is the context.</div>

2, there's auto checkpoint.

2/3 use Git to keep history. Feel free to use auto context, if you willing to pay for all the tokens.</div>

It’s free to use, bring your own key. 
Chat history with checkpoints. 
MCP, tools, local workspace
Highly customizable, edit your system prompts how you see fit via easily managed webui interface. 
Local workspace leads to an emergent property of a memory bank. 

Not only is the chanting context, you can see how much of the context window is being used, and it has knowledge of your file structure and all open tabs you have in VS Code. It can store your whole project in context with big enough windows like Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Same here. I use 1. for discussions. Especially Google AI Studio keeps history perfectly. And there is tooling to integrate this into VS Code.

  
For 2. I mostly use Cline. (used Continue in the early days) for its ease of use and the pay-as-you-go/bring your own key. Copilot currently isnt worth the money

For 3. There are also things like Aider and Plandex and so on. These are far better in planning and following than 2. But it is more complicated. I use it  rarely</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Actually you should try something called **Cognitive Shuffling**. It's a relatively new technique used to put insomniacs to sleep, so it should work on most people. 

Pick a word like Bear and then take the b and think about all the things that start with b that you can think of. Picture it in your mind, examine it and then move on to the next b thing. When you're tired of the Bs, then go to Es and so on. It makes it impossible to think about stressful things that might cause anxiety, and activates whatever part of the brain manages the early stages of REM sleep, so you're much more likely to fall asleep. 

Obviously if bears cause you anxiety you can pick any other word to start with and then try not to think about the bears waiting for you to fall asleep. Are they in your closet and under your bed, or that your closest family and friends might secretly be bears wearing the skin suits of your closest family and friends.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don't usually have problems falling asleep so my experience probably doesn't help the average insomniac, but the words technique has been successful so far for me whenever I'm not feeling like sleeping but have to.

I do it slightly differently tho, I think if a word then only one word per letter in that word, and no imagining or picturing it, and the last word I use for the last letter is my new word to cycle through

Ie: bear, blackmail, eye, airplane, racoon.
Rice, animal, coconut, Oxygen, onomatopoeia, nice

And I will stop here cus I usually fall asleep by the third or fourth word and i need to submit this comment</div>

                <div class="post-content">Bought Born Primitive shoes last year.  
\- Bought in September. Took 4 weeks to even ship the shoes.  
\- Then the laces were useless. Round to look stylish, but would not stay knotted. So those had to be replaced.  
\- It's now been 6 months of use and the shoes are falling apart. There is a hole in the back heel of the shoe that I've never seen in any shoe, ever.

Literally garbage.</div>

As of 2014 or something we spent $7,000,000,000,000 on the failed Iraqi invasion. The power vacuum we created resulted in ISIS and gave them 150,000+ guns among other atrocities. 

Imagine all that money invested into the United States public and social infrastructure. We could all have great healthcare and education. We could have high speed rail. We could have affordable child care. 

We’ve worked our asses off to fund pointless “wars” which are really just imperialist schemes that line the pockets of private defense contractors.</div>

The current ("latest") version is still \`[0.1.2505172129](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openai/codex/v/0.1.2505172129)\` which is the very version of the public release many weeks ago.

It is true open source project, there are 151 open PRs and yet it almost seems like an orphaned project already.</div>

It was impressive when they "only" had an image generator, but now having midjourney video on top of their existing image models...  
They have to outsource quite a lot of tasks, but only having 11 full time staff seems nonsensical.</div>

I’ve dealt with OCD “pure O” and depression since I was 19. For a long time, I thought I just had a phone addiction. I was picking up my phone 50+ times a day, scrolling endlessly through Reddit, Instagram, and YouTube.

Iran didn’t build a nuke.
They built a train.

A rail line that connects oil directly to Russia, India, and the BRICS block no tankers, no U.S. Navy, no petrodollar.

No SWIFT. No IMF. No permission.

And that’s why they got bombed.

Not for uranium.

                                <div class="reply-body">Posting my comment from a previous thread.

Just listened to an interesting theory. Basically Iran is one of the final large investments that China made with their belt and road initiative. China buys all their oil from Iran and China helps build infrastructure, then Iran invests into China. Iran hasn’t been holding up their part of investing back into China then we blow up the goods they sell to China.

Long story short we’ve been systematically knocking out Chinas unstable allies to keep them from becoming the dominant economy and to uphold US hegemony. I don’t know if there’s any weight to this but it sounds like it makes sense.

EDIT: adding a little more.

Theory I heard was just that the belt and road initiative isn’t as successful as China was hoping. The investment in Africa isn’t panning out quite like they hoped.

Iran sells oils way under market price to China because of sanctions. The transaction is done with Chinese currency instead is US dollars so China tells Iran to spend their newly acquired Chinese currency back in China. This helps China with cheap energy and boosts their economy. If Iran falls China loses a whole lot of cheap energy.

I’m just repeating a theory I heard I thought was interesting. I think weakening China is the ultimate goal.</div>

Just recently the first train was operated on this route and was a part of bigger china-europe railway and this also connects several cental asian(?) countries like Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan,etc

This halves the time taken for transport of goods from 30 days to 15 days

Along with that there is INSTC that is in place .i.e international north south transport corridor that connects russia-iran-india while bypassing the suez canal again it is faster and connects several others on the way 

Additionally india has been heavily investing in iran's chabahar port since 2015</div>

How many different books could be written with the English vocabulary?  Probably a lot more than 10^28.

Anyways, we’ve known that LLMs (transformers, both encoders and decoders) can learn higher order structure of discrete sequences.  Look at the Chinese character separation problem.</div>

It compresses the data and “parrots” the patterns, which is much more feasible with a smaller number of weights instead of memorizing the states. No one is saying that LLMs are a bunch of if-else statements, but they are still learning and reapplying the statistical patterns of the game. Whether LLMs being stochastic parrots means that they are not intelligent is not up to me to decide though.</div>

I understand GPT mimics the way humans talk, but it doesn't really talk the way the typical human talks. It talks in a very formal artificial way that I just can't escape, even when reading yt comments.

Am I crazy or is this a real thing happening, even in yt comments?

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;”And, as we can assign no limits to the progress of invention, neither can we assign any limits to the increase of rent, short of the whole produce. For, if labor-saving inventions went on until perfection was attained, and the necessity of labor in the production of wealth was entirely done away with, then everything that the earth could yield could be obtained without labor, and the margin of cultivation would be extended to zero.”

&gt;”Wages would be nothing, and interest would be nothing, while rent would take everything. For the owners of the land, being enabled without labor to obtain all the wealth that could be procured from nature, there would be no use for either labor or capital, and no possible way in which either could compel any share of the wealth produced. And no matter how small population might be, if anybody but the land owners continued to exist, it would be at the whim or by the mercy of the land owners they would be maintained either for the amusement of the land owners, or, as paupers, by their bounty. This point, of the absolute perfection of labor-saving inventions, may seem very remote, if not impossible of attainment; but it is a point toward which the march of invention is every day more strongly tending.”

I think the critical threshold of a Western country is 25 % (for a longer period of time).
