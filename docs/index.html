                                <div class="reply-body">At the beginning of Dan Carlins hardcore history on WWI, Blueprint for Armageddon, Carlin blamed the starting of WW1 at least partially on mediocre leadership in the UK, Germany and Russia. For example Germany couldn’t do the same geopolitical tactics post Bismarck. 

The level of leadership in countries around the world is honestly frightening to me. Mediocre would be a compliment to the political leadership in the USA, Canada and Europe over the last decade. I think this partially by design by the rich, the one thing that truly would frighten them would be a strong leader that actually wants to do what’s best for their country. But the level of leadership the world has right now is honestly at a hundred year low point.</div>

He was asked how much of the code was actually generated by claude code itself and provided a pretty surprising number. Granted, humans still did the directing and definitely reviewed the code, but that is pretty wild.

If we look ahead a couple of years, it seems very plausible that these agents will be writing close to 99% of their own code, with humans providin...</div>

Being able to direct these agents is a skill like any other at the moment. Some people can do it better than others.

I have neuropathy so I had to dump a ton of time into making the most out of these tools. Creating very comprehensive rules and documentation files, trading. Very clear instructions for testing and iterating based on tests, parallel agents for a given task to explore various solutions paths, etc. I think his percentage is fair considering that I actually fall into the same percentage roughly lol.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I feel like to those of us who are in this kind of space a lot (which I imagine is most of us in this sub) it seems pretty obvious how easy it is to use. But I've talked with people I know who aren't into this stuff *at all* in any way and can see that there is a bit of a learning curve, as well as just resistance to (being forced into) adopting new tech.

Normies are very conditioned into asking a brief question to google and looking at a few entries. It's a paradigm shift and kind of a mindfuck for them to be having a conversation with "the google". They seem to struggle with the concept of adding more details to what they're "googling" in order to get better results, and being able to ask follow up questions or being able to refine what they're getting.

Even working in tech, I've found many of my colleagues just shrugging and saying "I don't even know what I'd ask it." It's kinda mind-boggling to me. I do my best to stay in the loop and up to speed on as much as I can in order to boost my productivity and seem valuable. I often think about the "AI won't replace your job, a human using AI will" and I want to be on the right side of that.</div>

As in having enough product knowledge to know how to leverage existing products. Obviously, the bar for using AI at all is intentionally and by design very low (like you pointed out).</div>

AI has gone agentic my man. It does things by itself. You give it a goal and it works towards it. Today those goals can’t be more than 30 minute tasks. For instance ChatGPT operator could submit job applications autonomously for you. But the time horizon will continue to increase over the next years to where you could tell it something like “open up an e commerce store and start making profit” and it will be able to do all the legwork based on that one command.</div>

I’ll warn you that it won’t always feel as easy or deliver such instant results, but if you stay with it (I’d recommend 20 minutes a day - you can go more if you want, but don’t force it) it will change your baseline in a big way. Good luck!</div>

Just how going to the gym isn't exactly a cheat code to getting healthy/fit, or going to work isn't a cheat code for getting rich: you have to do the work. And it can be really hard, especially when the ADHD is running rampant. But it certainly is a useful and beneficial technique to help, that's for sure!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">All forms of meditation will help ADHD.

The trick is finding forms that aren't intensely boring and pointless-seeming to someone with ADHD. That can take awhile, and is connected with our individual personality, tastes, strengths, and weaknesses. So it isn't one size fits all. 

That said, for me to begin a meditation practice that did not feel boring and pointless, but rather brought instant results, I initially did breathwork of various kinds (such as Wim Hof/ Tummo, or various types of breathing where the exhale is twice as long as the inhale; eg, 4-7-8 breathing). What is very good about those with ADHD is that you can do those exercises while thinking a mile a minute and you will still feel results, and with a daily practice and enough time it will begin to noticeably calm your mind the rest of the day.

Eventually this practice calmed and focused my mind enough to try other forms of meditation. Since someone mentioned mantras, you can use a word or phrase. It can be meaningful, it can be nonsense, it can be from an existing spiritual tradition or not. Something that is very like a mantra you can try is counting. I silently think 1 2 3 4....1000 and then begin 1 2 3 4...1000 - a full cycle takes about 18-20 minutes. You can choose any number, 1000 might be hard to chew on at first, you could us another high number. The point is that you are controlling your thoughts and filling the space where normally you'd be thinking. Although counting is mental activity, since we are so familiar with the number sequence it isn't analytical thinking. You do that long enough and your mind settles down and, well, defrags.</div>

People hardly go faster in an 80 than many 65s. Except Houston, half the people want to go over 90. 

I started driving cross country where a lot of limits were 70 or 75 that are now 75 or 80. People drive about the same, but now cops are less of a concern.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I drove in Michigan for the first time about two weeks ago, and in my limited experience, 70 MPH speed limits there felt more like 90 MPH. I didn’t encounter any 75 MPH zones though. Drove from I-75 from the Ohio border to I-94 to the Ontario border.

However out of the 25 or so states I’ve driven in, Michigan was the first where I could set my cruise control to 90 MPH right after entering the highway and flow perfectly with traffic the entire time. Most drivers also followed proper lane discipline. Honestly, your state was one of my favorites to drive in.</div>

The issue however is if you have unlimited time, there is really no pressure to get things done and ultimately I think would take a lot of the meaning out of life. I think this except from Steve Jobs Stanford commencement speech sums it up perfectly “Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is how it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent.”</div>

Mind upload might increase the chances of "immortality", although not a true 100% escape from death still, and will you be you still in that case, in some sort of simplified non-cell-based brain?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You didnt even get the conspiracy right my man.... The prince is Mohammed Bin Salman (guy who murdered Khashoggi) and he was staying at the Four Seasons Hotel which occupies the top floors of Mandalay Bay.  Its not "King Solomon" its King Salman but its Prince Bin Salman who eventually became leader that was the likely target since he is Crown Prince.  You also forgot to mention that soon after this event, dozens of Saudi Princes were purged from the country. This included the arrests of many Al-Waheebs including MBS's own mother, wife of King Salman.

This theory was first spread by none other than Alex Jones.  [Salon Article about AJ's theory](https://www.salon.com/2017/11/28/alex-jones-las-vegas-shooting-is-as-phony-as-obamas-birth-certificate/)  It should be noted that MBS and Trump have long had a weird friendship. You may remember MBS giving 2 billion dollars to one of Trump's sons to start his investment firm. Something will come of that relationship and funding... we already saw how quickly Trump acted against Houthis in Yemen (who are fighting Saudi Arabian presence there) and will likely culminate in a war against Iran during Trump's term, both Trump and MBS want Iran removed (but for different reasons).</div>

Often times you will be able to check if you are getting a good deal or not, **but the biggest benefit is finding older photos of the vehicle on any "bid" auction sites that show it as being wrecked or totaled previously.**

You can sometimes even find the police reports or damage reports from City websites with regard to your used vehicle if it was involved in an incident prior.</div>

So we did when we found a really good car too good to be true, we called and he ran the check for us. Unfortunately it had been in a small accident that some group had actually seemingly fixed damage and got a salvage title. So we dodged that because he was actually a decent used car salesman.</div>

They can run all of those vin checks, ISO searches ect and get the entire history of that car from when it was first sold. If they're insuring it, they have a vested interest  in the car too. They'll do that the minute you put it on your policy anyway. I've worked at three auto ins companies in underwriting and claims since 2005.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A lifetime of reskilling sounds potentially awful, depending on the skills required to learn and who gets the profits and returns from all that effort and time.  I see a trend in people doing everything they can to become as detached from having to compete in this mad race as possible. Permaculture, homesteading, reducing consumption, doing for themselves and their communities as much as they can to minimize the need to compete in these hypermarkets. We will probably see more groups of people adopting the level of technology they are comfortable with and detaching as much as possible, in order to live a human life, 'solarpunk' communities. These smirking CEOs will eventually lose control of the situation, maybe even before actual AGI comes on the scene, with sufficiently advanced and indispensable AI. They will be like the CEO of Brawndo, thinking the are running things, when in fact they have little to no actual control.  Hell, we might be in that scenario right now in part. Hopefully the intelligences that arise from these efforts will treat this place like an ecosystem valued for generating unique and unpredictable and not strip mined for resources. We should use what leverage we have as workers and members of society to influence that end as much as we can.</div>

Looks like it currently has some versions of Gemma 3, Qwen3, Phi-4 Mini, and Llama 3.2.
