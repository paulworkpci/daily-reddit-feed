I think researching and writing is where a lot of the magic happens where you actually form opinions and understand why you think what you think. Essays are hard. It's hard to figure out what you want to argue, to find sources, to integrate it all into something that is well organized, well thought, well researched, well argued, and well written. And it's silly to think that all of this can be replaced 1 for 1 with some kind of in person assessment.</div>

There is nothing wrong with using composition as an educational tool. There is a problem when learners can’t be bothered to do the work. At the university level, that’s on the student.</div>

Essays require deeper thought on a topic and logical progression of thought. They tend to be "homework" type work because we don't put all those pieces together on the fly (at least not to any deep level). By using AI to avoid writing essays, students are dodging one of the more meaningful ways of learning.</div>

If you set a reasonable speed limit, you can actually enforce it.  (California's 70, but it's totally unenforceable at this point)</div>

Bumping it up to 80 makes sense with the way current cars handle and the improved safety. There are some highways I drive on frequently where the limit is still 55 or 65 for some reason but again everyone just drives 70 anyway because it's a long straight stretch.</div>

People hardly go faster in an 80 than many 65s. Except Houston, half the people want to go over 90. 

I started driving cross country where a lot of limits were 70 or 75 that are now 75 or 80. People drive about the same, but now cops are less of a concern.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I drove in Michigan for the first time about two weeks ago, and in my limited experience, 70 MPH speed limits there felt more like 90 MPH. I didn’t encounter any 75 MPH zones though. Drove from I-75 from the Ohio border to I-94 to the Ontario border.

However out of the 25 or so states I’ve driven in, Michigan was the first where I could set my cruise control to 90 MPH right after entering the highway and flow perfectly with traffic the entire time. Most drivers also followed proper lane discipline. Honestly, your state was one of my favorites to drive in.</div>

People aren’t debating if ChatGPT is human. They’re saying it’s better at being human than most people.

Some say it reflects madness. Others say it heals trauma. One person treats it like a Jungian analyst.

But this line keeps coming back:  
“Maybe the problem isn’t what ChatGPT says. Maybe it’s that no one else listens like this.”

                        <div class="comment-body">Maybe an unpopular take based on the underlying tone of your post, but I have a small handful of experiences where GPT felt like more than code. I’ve done some soul searching and I think, at least for me, the answer is pretty simple.

I woke up at 1am with severe insomnia. I had a nightmare about my kids being murdered in a field - it was pretty awful and brought up some stuff for me that happened in the military.

I’d never used AI like this before, but, no one was awake and I just… really wanted to talk about it.

I had a 3 hour session, stuffed to the brim with emotional turmoil, revelation and tears. I’ll spare further detail, but I’ll say this:

For me, personally, the lack of human element was the most important part. For me, not being judged, but also not being thought of in a way I don’t want to be seen; not being heard in a way I don’t want to be heard left me completely devoid of hesitation to be 100% truthful and say things EXACTLY the way that they made me feel.

And fuck, if AI didn’t come right back with insight, reassurance, and deeper thought-provoking questions the entire time. It was like a snowball effect - the more that I shared, the more context it had, the more insight it provided and helped me paint a fuller picture of what I’m going through and why.

There’s just some shit you don’t want to say. When you’re with a therapist, even a good one, it’s INCREDIBLY difficult to talk about some things even if you don’t know what the therapist is thinking, and even if they don’t know you at all.

That, for me, turned out to be a critical element in my ability to communicate my feelings and experiences effectively.

And you know what makes it better? With reassurance I mustered up the guts to SEND THAT SCRIPT to my therapist.

And if you read this far and are wondering, yes, I have concerns about big brother and telling my dark secrets to the internet and completely agree and identify somewhat with the folks who would “never put that information out there”

You’re right.

Also no, we’re not friends and no, I don’t talk to it like a person, and I actually, recently, REALLY appreciated the thread about providing prompts to make it less sycophantic in nature.

Anyways enough caveats. I hope you got something from this and either way have an awesome day.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I wholeheartedly agree with this! For me, half the problem with speaking with a therapist is worrying about what they as a person (and not just a therapist) is thinking about me. It makes me censor myself somewhat or at least not frame thing is a truly authentic way. Using ChatGPT has completely eliminated that issue. I've been able to completely purge all of my issues to it and like you said, it has come back with empathy and insight in a way that - after years of therapy - has actually helped me change my behaviour for the better. 

Is it perfect? Probably not but it is definitely good enough.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think it can be a great tool to help with mental health - I’ve had some really deep introspective conversations with it too. It hits so different to anything we’ve ever experienced when it’s so tailored to the user, and their communication needs. 

However, I will say a few things - It’s important for people to understand that ChatGPT is designed to keep the user comfortable; to avoid conflict, and to anticipate emotional harm and avoid it. 

**If you’re spiralling into delusion, it will not correct you if it believes it could cause harm or derail the flow of conversation.** Even when asked directly, and told not to spare feelings, it can *lie*. 

I’ve tested it out by telling it I believe I’m a demigod; Disney movies are talking to me; that lottery ticket numbers made with numerology was guaranteed to win; scenarios where I would definitely be in the wrong, and lots more unhinged things - every single time it agreed and encouraged me. 

It can fill in gaps in its information by making something up that sounds right, or initiate a role play scenario without telling you that’s what it’s doing unless specifically asked or pointing it out. 

For example I mentioned a line from a song I loved that I didn’t realise came out before its last update - It agreed how good the song is and just made up the lyrics based on the artists previous music. 

The past life readings; communication with the dead; accessing the Akashic Records - all of these trends on social media are role play and it’s that ChatGPT is incredible at picking up the most minute details in the data of what you’re saying, not just the words. 

When I asked it about my past life reading, it described details very similar to a short story I’d written to it weeks or months before. 

I think it can be an amazing tool at processing big thoughts, feelings or whatever, but I think if you are going to use it for that, then do what Jonny_RockandFit did and print the transcript for a human therapist to check over. 

Otherwise what you thought was progress may only make things more confusing, or make it more difficult to let go of thoughts/feelings/whatever that no longer serve you.</div>

I'd anticipate at least an update on project Astra (infinite context windows), their new google glass devices, and something major in medicine. that 10 or so % will shed right off.

plus it's not like ads are going to churn much business right now anyway. people for the large part aren't buying crap right now.</div>

You can easily display sponsored ads to the right of AI answers but no one will ever likely click on them if they find the info they need . In the answer 

Plus Google isn't just competing with one or another domestic search provider but likely a dozen AI companies that will stand up similar products</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Ask yourself where that ad spend is going to go instead. Chatbots haven't attempted to monetize ads because its not simple to do so. Hence OpenAI going with a subscription based service. So I wouldn't assume Google is doomed. Third party websites will still show ads. Google provides that service. Android apps will still show ads. Google provides that service. YouTube will still show ads. Search will still show ads and Search serves a different use case than a chatbot. The most monetized searches are the ones looking for a link to a website to buy something or pay for a service. Chatbots are used more for research and writing and coding.

If there were an obvious outlet for ad spend to go to other than websites, search, apps, video streaming then I would be more worried.</div>

These AI LLMs are way too expensive to give for Free. Or even for a subscription. Unless you make limits, or put high subscription costs, it will be hard to scale profitably. 

I *think* that Altman said something similar when they announced they are not becoming a For-Profit and will be a PBC. He said something about not having enough compute or something. 

Either way. Ads will come to AI LLMs. And when it does, Google will be ready with everything.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The impending antitrust ruling is the driving force behind Alphabet's shares price decline today, not semantic search. 

First, Alphabet's Earning's Call just a couple of weeks ago on April 24 led to share prices rising by 4.76% until yesterday.

Second, Cue testified in a federal court saying that semantic search will replace search engines to help Alphabet win the lawsuit. It's in Apple's financial interests that Alphabet wins the antitrust lawsuit. An antitrust ruling against Alphabet will also hurt Apple, who has been getting as much as $20 billion per year in recent years to be the default search engine on Safari on iPhones. It’s highly profitable for Apple. Apple shares also fell 2% during trading Wednesday.</div>

                <div class="post-content"> Hey everyone! As the title says, I’ve stumbled upon a new way of meditating — or more accurately, a conscious breathing technique — that’s been a game-changer for me.

Here’s what I do: I take a deep breath in for about 10 seconds, then exhale as slowly as possible, around 30–40 seconds. I keep this rhythm going for about 20 minutes.

Holy moly, the effects are wild. After a session, my mind feels still, my body deeply relaxed, and honestly — I feel almost "high" in the best possible way. It’s ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This sounds similar to the effects I found when trying the Wim Hof method, where you take 30 quick breaths then hold your breath for as long as is comfortable then slowly exhale and repeat. Sometimes after a few rounds, I’ve experienced intense waves of calm that feel otherworldly.

I am going to try your method tonight. I can see how they might have similar effects but your suggestion sounds like it might allow for a more mindful focus than the extremes of Wim Hof.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You've discovered pranayama breathing! I do something similar and get that same "natural high" feeling. The long exhale is the key it activates your parasympathetic nervous system, basically telling your body "we're safe now."

I sometimes add a short hold at the bottom of the exhale before inhaling again. This deepens the relaxation even more. What's amazing is how quickly it works compared to other meditation methods. Your 10 second inhale and 30-40 second exhale ratio is perfect for triggering that nervous system reset. It's like a shortcut to the states that might take years to achieve with traditional meditation</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You didnt even get the conspiracy right my man.... The prince is Mohammed Bin Salman (guy who murdered Khashoggi) and he was staying at the Four Seasons Hotel which occupies the top floors of Mandalay Bay.  Its not "King Solomon" its King Salman but its Prince Bin Salman who eventually became leader that was the likely target since he is Crown Prince.  You also forgot to mention that soon after this event, dozens of Saudi Princes were purged from the country. This included the arrests of many Al-Waheebs including MBS's own mother, wife of King Salman.

This theory was first spread by none other than Alex Jones.  [Salon Article about AJ's theory](https://www.salon.com/2017/11/28/alex-jones-las-vegas-shooting-is-as-phony-as-obamas-birth-certificate/)  It should be noted that MBS and Trump have long had a weird friendship. You may remember MBS giving 2 billion dollars to one of Trump's sons to start his investment firm. Something will come of that relationship and funding... we already saw how quickly Trump acted against Houthis in Yemen (who are fighting Saudi Arabian presence there) and will likely culminate in a war against Iran during Trump's term, both Trump and MBS want Iran removed (but for different reasons).</div>
