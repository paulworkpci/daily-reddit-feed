What a terrible look for OpenAI. Their models are failing in live demos, clearly the PowerPoint was created by AI and has major errors, and these engineers, as smart as they are, should NOT be on screen, they are so stiff and their “acting” seems so fake.

I appreciate the live demos, I get that shows some “trust” and a pre-recorded demo isn’t as “trustworthy”</div>

Also, as a programmer, being able to give the api a context free grammar and have a guaranteed response is huge. 

Again, I'm disappointed with gpt-5 but I'm still going to try it out in the api and make my own assessment.</div>

Gemini-2.5-Pro costs less than Sonnet on paper but ends up costing more in practical use because of reasoning.  
  
The reasoning model will also take much longer to respond. Delay is bad for developer productivity, you get distracted and start browsing reddit.</div>

GPT5 outperforms it on complex debugging and implementations that span multiple files in large codebases. It's slower, but more deliberate, improvises less and sticks to your instructions more, then asks for clarifications or offers choice when something is unclear instead of wandering off on its own. Fewer death spirals where it goes in circles correcting its own edits. 

For smaller edits in a single file it makes no sense to use it, just use Sonnet 4. But if you have a feature that will need 5-6+ files to be edited, this thing is wondrous. Kicks ass in lesser known frameworks, too.

However, Anthropic is likely to be coming out with something fresh in the next two months, so we'll see how that turns out.</div>

Granted, on some people a big expense triggers the "sunk cost fallacy" that pushes them to continue. (Example: I already bought a Peloton, might as well use it instead of renewing my gym membership).


But if you have a history of doing that and it not working...then yeah, the trigger wasn't good enough and it's best to find other ways to motivate yourself.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, on the surface level, I could see how money laundering could be easily done. You could basically take any girl set her up with an only fans that doesn’t even have to be explicit, it could be just a bunch of selfies, and then let’s say that girl has a boyfriend who is even a small time, drug dealer. He basically subscribed to her only fans and send her money through her only fans which she then would pocket. And she would basically have an income off those subscribers  and I’m sure they could even send her money through only fans as “tips” or “gifts” so long as she declares only fans as a source of income and pays taxes at the end of the year then the money that goes in dirty comes out clean (after paying necessary fees,taxes etc) if the person that was sending her, the money wanted to maintain some sort of level of an anonymity to eliminate as much of the paper trail as possible I’m sure that’s doable. It would just require a little bit more work on the senders side. Now I’m no expert in this sort of field, but this is kind of the way that it seems to be laid out to me. When you’re talking millions of dollars cash I’m sure there’s definitely a little bit more thought that needs to go into this whole process. I would think as far as my train of thought goes people would start running into issues when they were sending her amounts in excess of $10,000 and that simply based off of the stereotypical “belief” that all cash deposits/purchases in excess of $9,999 are supposed to be declared or paperwork has to be filled out at the bank once their involved.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Consider placing a tub of baking soda with a scoop in your kitchen somewhere that's easy to access. Under or beside the sink usually is good. 
  
  A good example would be one of those 32 or 64 oz yogurt containers, with one of those little protein powder dispenser scoops in it. You can leave the lid off too; it's  easier to use that way.

 Not only is it great for cleaning pots, pans, and your sink, but a couple scoops will quickly put out a grease fire.

Coincidentally the stove is just a step away from that cupboard so it’s useful for fires too, which is one of the reasons I always make sure to open the box as soon as I need a new one.</div>

When I buy baking soda I never can even use all of it before it expires so a 64 ounce container sounds like a lifetime. Just one box is enough to out out a grease fire and if you need more than that well you need a fire extinguisher.</div>

As soon as it turns out that their leader is almost certainly on the list, suddenly they don't care about it anymore.

Im absolutely flabbergasted, how are these people real. Do they not have a single critical thinking brain cell in their heads.</div>

But it’s pretty obvious that there is solid evidence that implicates Trump to Epstein abuse of underage girls. And that this collection of evidence (aka “the list”) is what he is hiding.</div>

Been testing GPT-5 in Cline for a few days (feels distinctly different from the Horizon stealth models), and it's really hit me that this is how a coding agent should feel -- not like Sonnet 4.

Don't get me wrong, Anthropic's models have gotten tons of love for their personality. They're great at coding, but they just run on and on. All that jovialness and verbosity might feel transparent and helpful, but it's actually kind of wasteful.

GPT-5 is the opposite. It's verbose and me...</div>

After the presentation of GPT-5 I tried OpenAI Codex with this model and it is really great. It created application, which works without any error and UI is really good. 

I believe, that today GPT-5 is the new leader for coding. I will definitely switch to it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think they trapped themselves with all the hype posts and podcasts about how amazing their progress is, while in reality progress was steady but relatively slow (compared to the gpt-3 gpt-4 jump for example).

They were releasing updates and new models weekly just to catch up with Google and because they need funding they pretended that they had much more in the pipelines than they actually did. Meanwhile their own hype was growing so big that they almost had no choice but to deliver the next model in the GPT-series.

It’s disappointing but not unexpected I guess. Let’s see how the public (consisting mostly of people that aren’t chronically online on Reddit) perceives this, maybe the twink will get away with it this time.</div>

 I guess I am not terribly surprised at where GPT-5 is at after seeing GPT4.5. (That being said, I really liked GPT4.5. it definitely understands nuanced prompts a lot better and seems to understand what you actually need from it even if it has to really read between the lines. And 4o hallucinates quite a lot, hopefully GPT-5 is way better on that front.)</div>

No mention of multimodality in the presentation as far as I could tell, no plans for it, I guess?

As of July 31st 2025, OpenAI collected 4x business revenue vs Anthropic according to the Information.

The Menlo article that says Anthropic surpassed Openai and Google in enterprise was a 150 person survey extrapolated out based on percentage of AI tool use and size of company respondents work at.  Oh unrelated, Menlo recently invested hundreds of millions in Anthropic before announcing these results: [https://menlovc.com/perspective/tripling-down-on-anthropic-why-were-excited-to-continue-investing-in-the-leader-in-the-future-of-ai/](https://menlovc.com/perspective/tripling-down-on-anthropic-why-were-excited-to-continue-investing-in-the-leader-in-the-future-of-ai/)</div>

I'm not a layer, but my understanding of the law is that if Carano's team had found any indication of impropriety or dishonesty on the part of Disney regarding this situation in any of those emails, then the judge could rule that the facts of the case be interpreted in a manner that favors Carano... and we all know Disney's been up to fuck shit since their inception. Certainly explains why she's "smiling."</div>

I'm an atheist, so I'm not interested in the spiritual or religious side of meditation — just the practical, secular aspects of the practice.  
Any recommendations for books that take this kind of pragmatic approach?

Thanks in advance.</div>
