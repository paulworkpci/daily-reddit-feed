Most importantly, you'll know where (most) of the stuff are related to a specific functionality, which will make you faster.

I'm saying this because I've read (and seen) people getting drown in AI cycles where a new feature breaks the whole app etc.

In comparison they say NVIDIA shipped about double that number of server GPUs in 2024 with the total of 3.8-4 million units.

When you consider between how many different large and small customers the Nvidia's number is split Google seems to be increasing compute way faster than anyone else.</div>

a) gather data to train future automated delivery drivers and to remove the costly humans from their bottom line

b) watch and monitor their drivers to ensure that no one is taking one second more on a break

Otherwise you're just trading one kind of mental static for another. Solid advice.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I just watched the Throttle House guys talk about some of the cars that came out in the last 5 years that they think will become classics in the future looking back 20 years from now. I thought that was a great conversation so wanted to ask what people here thought. 

I'd say anything with a B58 right now is kinda cheating given the legendary status that engine has been building over the last however many years, but what other cars do you guys think will become modern classics in the future?

Edit: I get it, I would not qualify for stamps.. it was more of a sarcastic joke because I'm barely living comfortably and I would have to give up much of my comforts to be able to afford a family... Hence why I said food stamps.</div>

Shane is an establishment Republican but never votes. Yes, they called Trump gay once in 2017 and Shane makes fun of both sides in his standup, but if you watch the podcast it's pretty clear where they stand. Even though it's gone downhill lately, they still have the funniest podcast by far.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I still give Shane a pass to this day because he's never promoting the actual stances of any politician. He shits on everyone and if you listen to every episode, you'll find he frequently dumps on Trumps decisions in passing. He's never happy about really anything Trump does like Rogan is. Rogan is all out supporting what Trump is doing, Shane is constantly asking... WTF are we doing, another war? I didn't sign up for this. 

Shane is a classic republican and a legit comedian calling out funny shit on the liberal side, which is funny. I'm mostly liberal and the culture war stuff specifically is what I enjoy being made fun of, like how can you not laugh at some of this stuff? He basically has the same opinion of many of us here about ICE / Immigration / War, like THE REAL issues that Trump is championing that are sending us into an apocalyptic hell hole</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Appreciate the words and I guess it was a rough day, figuring out what to do in life can definitely make you feel out of yourself. 

I love training and illustrating stories, today was one of those days where I guess I needed a jumpstart.

I was writing about preserving the passion to whatever it is you love to do and one topic was on how there’s going to be a lot of days when you feel completely out of it, but it’s coming back to anchor points and relighting the fire again and again.

Similar feelings with studying Mechanical Engineering, I enjoyed it a lot more when I would go out of my way to research things and explore just for myself not because someone set an assignment , that excited me and then university came a long and it just got so boring. I would literally go to the library at like 2AM pick up a book and read a story…university library was magical so whenever I felt uninspired I remembered I’m literally surrounded by 1million+ books.

One was about people that couldn’t read because they never learned or simply it just never came to them. Made me reflect on how when you don’t know your vowels you miss out on so much and just the very nature of reading interested me because it’s like a spiral and that journey is so different for people; some stop very early some continue go on, but that in itself is a thing of endurance.

The Feynman Lectures were eye opening to me. He would have these books and as if having an argument with the author he would write whether he agrees or doesn’t agree and go off to think about unexplored questions.

Reading plays a big part into my training sessions because it’s how I inspire myself to push beyond limits or when I’m doing some problem solving inspire myself to look for the solution.

Sometimes it’s the blending, bending and breaking of the things you know to give something new that really shows you the true beauty of just trying something new that you’ve never done before.

This session was definitely a wordless ode to that.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">"visual" analysis is tough for LLMs.  They are getting better, but it's still a lagging capability.  They are much better at creating complex images than they are at understanding complex images.

Our eyes, visual cortex, and interconnections to the rest of the brain are marvels of billions of years of evolution.  It's like if someone had a camera sensor that is built directly on top of a GPU's lvl3 cache while it is continuously running multiple models simultaneously.

Right now it is just so much more compute efficient to only do text input.  I think we'll get there but it might still be a data center generation away.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I did it’s giving me mixed answers 

For example GPT says each text can’t be more than 8192 tokens long and an array of texts can be max 300k tokens total all the texts summed up 

But then deepseek says the same but in addition to that it says an array of texts can’t be more than 2048 in length ! So an array can contain max 2048 pieces of text 

So I’m kind of confused</div>

Can't see the nature version cause of the paywall, but the techxplore summary shows similar claims to the original 2020 paper.

                                <div class="reply-body">The 2020 work was earlier and showed proof-of-concept: meta-learning update rules (LPG) trained on toy or limited environments and transferring to Atari games.  ￼The 2025 paper claims to scale this up significantly (“large-scale experiments”, “a population of agents”, “a large number of complex environments”) and to achieve state-of-the-art results. You are simply seeing that researchers have been working on this problem for at least the last five years.

 Some things gotta be expressed, then processed, in order to be understood, which will then be conducive for being let go.

It's not so much "stop thinking" but rather, not letting the chatter override and bind you, and being freed up to presently bear witness to this moment. Your mind will still be able to think, it just won't unconsciously feed into the unnecessary obsessive chatter</div>

It was addressed in a David Nichtern interview on the Duncan Trussel podcast. My sessions fluctuate wildly depending on how much stress I have in my life. But I try to sit daily even when it is only 5 minutes, and feel that it is a routine now that improves my resilience to the difficulties of life. Allowing yourself to just experience life is one of the most difficult things that meditation has taught me.</div>

A new “Markovian Thinking” approach helps AI models handle much longer reasoning by breaking their thinking into small, linked steps.

                                <div class="reply-body">As counterintuitive as this sounds, I think a lot of transformer specific concepts and ideas are a lot more intuitive (at least to me) than early 20th century physics and beyond. I tried for a physics minor, couldn’t cut it at junior level phys courses, so I “downgraded” to computational physics (basically numerical analysis).

But a lot of the modern LLM stuff is just built off of pure engineering and intuition driven abstractions. If you’re serious about understanding the field and have a reasonable background in compsci and some numerical analysis or linear algebra, it probably takes about less than a week to be comfortable reading SoTA papers and get comfortable with mapping out the field. The actual “core” of the transformer is really small and easy to internalize. The specializations these days tend to lean towards either engineering/incremental optimizations or theoretical ideas. Both are fairly accessible to new comers. My favorite anecdote here is that the (still) SoTA method for training-free context extension was first discovered by “random redditors” on this very sub before being rediscovered and formalized and published later by Meta and then Eleuther.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, the naming here is kinda misleading. Looks like  you’re coming from a traditional Markov chain or HMM background, so I get you.

They’re not saying reasoning itself is Markovian - they’re forcing a Markov-like structure onto how the model handles long reasoning chains.

From what I’ve read, they basically chop the whole reasoning process into chunks, and each chunk only gets to look at the one right before it - not the full chain. So they’re kinda faking a Markov property. It sounds like using a first-order Markov assumption in NLP - we know it’s not fully true, but it’s often good enough when the trade-off saves tons of compute.

So, they’re betting that most reasoning steps only need a short-term summary, not the entire conversation history.

P.S I’m wondering if it will tank reasoning quality the same way deepseek did. We will see</div>
