                        <div class="comment-body">Because at its core it's a terminal, and every prompt is stand-alone, so after you make a prompt you can still execute terminal commands to change directory or do whatever you want. 

So the whole conversation isn't a separate OS process which can be sandboxed. 

When you call codex, it's sandboxed unless you tell it that it shouldn't be. You call it from the terminal and the UI runs in the terminal, but it's still a separate process. 

If Warp wants to add a sandbox, they have to rethink their whole app or introduce another process per prompt that will then be sandboxed.</div>

If you have one of these, please take it out of the box, read the instructions, and make sure you know how to deploy it. Store it somewhere you can grab quickly.

                        <div class="comment-body">After watching some news article about a fire my mom was adamant about doing a fire drill. My room was in the basement, the scenario was that the stairs were inaccessible so I needed to escape via the window leading to the backyard. Well, said window let out into, I’m not sure what it’s called, but a little area that I could stand up halfway then needed to open a grate. That grate was locked shut. Fortunately we never had a fire but in retrospect it was nice to find out the escape plan was a dead end beforehand.</div>

You found a pretty big issue, so I'd say it was a successful drill.      

Also, drills should contain the 'afterwards' too.   

Where to meet up safely, who is in charge, maybe emergency supplies, too.    

People are less hesitant to flee in their underwear if they know there's a crate(with combination lock) that contains some clothes out in the back yard or something.</div>

“You think mold is just a biological nuisance? No! It’s ideological! It’s insidious! Mold creeps and spreads and colonizes, just like Marxist ideology! It doesn’t care about hierarchies, it doesn’t even have two straightforward sexes, it’s an amorphous organism that is the physical manifestation of chaos and disorder! And chaos and disorder is what Marxists worship. Worst of all, when you ignore it, it thrives…. just like the postmodernist nonsense infiltrating our institutions. Clean your room? Of course! But also, dehumidify your basement! Because if you don’t, you’re not just inviting spores, you’re inviting revolution!</div>

Any position of power requires anointment by other powerful people. The CEO needs the board of directors. The entrepreneur needs investors. Sports figures, movies stars, politicians of course, they all need to be first picked by someone more powerful in order to ascend. 

If you are in a position of power and want to stay that way you're going to want to pick someone you can control. The apprentice always wants to become the master and to prevent that the master makes sure they have some type of leverage. And then it just becomes a huge cycle of blackmail where everyone has dirt on everyone else. It's mutually assured destruction.</div>

So most of us would die. Those who could provide for themselves, could maybe survive for a bit, but it's much much harder than we can imagine without functioning society.

So _we do know_ that in a scenario where most jobs are lost, societies would collapse in an uncontrolled manner and the end result would be most of us dying.</div>

If AI were to take over 100% of humanity’s work, then perhaps we would become to it what chimpanzees are to us.  
We would still possess intelligence. We would still feel emotion. Yet we would no longer hold control over society.  
Civilization would be managed by AI; art and entertainment would be created by AI; and humans would simply watch the results, rejoicing or despairing as spectators.  
Just as chimpanzees live in cages and are fed bananas, we would live comfortably inside algorithmic cages.</div>

None of these are actually necessary or guaranteed. This is akin to a religious conviction. AI might reach general intelligence and be totally alien to us. It might be fundamentally unable to act independently due to intention or accident of training or a technical limitation of whatever technology (that has not yet been invented) allows agi to happen.


We have no idea if AI that can take the world over is possible. And we have no reason to guess at a shape or trajectory of a kind of mind alien to anything we have ever known.</div>

Grok code costs 1/20 of sonnet and does mostly the same for simple deterministic tasks for pennies instead of dollars. Also heard good things about GLM 4.6 which is dirt cheap but I've not tried it. To use modest amount of SOAT models on a budget, Windsurf might also be an option. It gives you 500 'premium' requests per month for 10$ which turns out to be cheaper than buying sonnet/gpt tokens as you go. Windsufr even offers grok-code for free, though I find it there not so smooth to work with.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Until you realize that it's magical because there's 170 mCP tools and it's calling out to 30 different artificial intelligence engines to make a single decision.... 

And that they over-provisioned everything during the release of codex CLI and they're slowly tuning back the power and turning it into suck. 

It's already about five times more limited than it was when they launched it. 

It's out of control and it's hammering data centers across the world and it's bleeding money. 

You're going to get hooked on a tool that's going to be taken away from you because of the reality of physics and resource allocation. 

And when you want it back it's going to cost $500 a month.

They set the bait now they're getting ready to reel it in.

Eventually the only way anybody is going to have full power codex or equivalent tools is if they're paying $1,000 a month for them. 

It will be priced out of the reach for a lot of people by necessity to keep resources down and manageable and profitable. 

There is no future where you're going to have a cheap and free artificial intelligence system with any kind of power it's going to cost a lot of money. 

And only people that can afford that are going to have it. 

If you're having a good experience with it right now it's because you're a new user and you haven't been throttled yet.

There's going to be a lot of people that come to depend on this and then have it taken away from them and then priced out of their reach. 

This reality is going to come soon.

Not even GPT pro is enough it too is heavily throttled even at $200 a month. 

The only ones that have full  power right now are on Enterprise plans and they're very expensive.</div>

People better learn to swim (code) or they're going to be fuuuuuuuucked. These tools could disappear tomorrow and nothing would change for me.

                                <div class="reply-body">But that's why the OP conditioned their speculation with "suppose that the lab leaders are correct about alignment being a trivial problem to solve." 

If alignment is solved, that means that some entity that's not the AI has very fine-grained control over both the AI, and the developments the AI carries out. In such a world, some humans maintain control over the AI, and OP is arguing that in such a world, his vision of the future follows from that.

If AI cannot be aligned -- I lean towards it being a massively difficult problem, especially when you account for the fact that if AI starts to make changes in the environment or changes to itself, then whatever built-in programming it has will probably be pulled in 'wild' directions that can't be anticipated beforehand -- then because the AI's reaction to changing developments in its environment and changes within itself cannot be predicted beforehand, then I'm not too optimistic that the future will be much better than what OP posits.</div>

The best the ChatGPT app can do:

“I can’t generate or simulate a video of a person (real or resembling a real individual like Will Smith) behaving in that manner. However, I can create an illustrated or animated-style depiction of a fictional character inspired by your idea — for example, a cartoon man energetically eating spaghetti.

Would you like me to make that animated-style version instead?”</div>

The moment things go quiet, my brain starts throwing thoughts at me from every direction. It’s like it doesn’t know what to do without noise.  
Before I started this, I’d always fill that silence with something scrolling, music, just anything to not sit in stillness. Meditation made me realize how much I avoided just being alone with my tho...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Silence shows you what's going on in your head. A lot of meditators find themselves crying during meditation. It's a great opportunity to connect with yourself.

Especially in this day and age in which everything is expected to create dopamine, there can be resistance to stillness. In my opinion, as long as you pair stillness with compassion, that's great. It's for sure a space you can grow into and work with. Silence can be very peaceful and enjoyable. It's for sure worth it to get to know the feeling better.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Great observation about sitting with discomfort! I completely agree.

In my experience it can also be helpful to have a loose connection with the body / breath, so you have something tangible to be aware of that is not connected to thought. 

I also find it helpful to view thoughts as natural patterns and not so much as “my thoughts”. They’re just a byproduct of having been born with a human brain. Just like clouds come into being and disperse through natural conditions, so thoughts come into being and disperse in a natural process. It’s when I attempt to resist that process that it gets more difficult.

I think you’re spot on to not follow them, that’s the ideal approach to bring in my opinion. Allow, but don’t follow. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">For me stillness is absolute Bliss! I'm saying that because at some stage you will have to make the same discovery even though stillness is uncomfortable for you right now. You can't substitute stillness with something else otherwise you will never get to experience silent awareness which is the goal of meditation. So I would say just take it gradually. Don't sit for long periods of time. Try doing many sessions but just for a few minutes at a time. You need to understand that you will have to overcome this barrier otherwise you will never find peace.</div>

The gains these other models have made like GPT-5 Pro despite hugely dropping cost is impressive, shows how far cost per intelligence level has come down. 

Also I’m not sure but o3-preview may have been more finetuned for ARC-AGI which I don’t believe any of GPT-5 is, which again makes its gains on the leaderboard impressive</div>
