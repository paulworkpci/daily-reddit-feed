Clearly a bait-and-switch.  I hope everyone that was paying $20+ / month for fast requests to demand a refund or initiate a chargeback.  Esp. those that were paying for multiple sets of 500 fast requests.</div>

I would STRONGLY recommend anyone considering doing ANY business with these folks to RECONSIDER.

  
This morning they changed and went 'unlimited' (not really unlimited) or 20x unlimited.

  
Well, I had 1k+ fast credits not used, and they are gone.  Now I seemingly have regular $20/month 'unlimited' limits.  Also, attempts to communicate with admins have resulted in a ban and multiple posts taken down.

                        <div class="comment-body">very very very shady company... ive been saying it many months ago and ppl quickly came to blame me for being spoiled for having such a tool

dont get me wrong Cursor is an amazing tool, its just their billing and pricing methods are very very shady... drug dealer shit right there

cutting corners on their product to improve margins... initially providing a very good price to get the user hooked and then worsen it as much as possible... offering MAX mode for desperate wealthy users once the main product is bad enough so they have a reason to "upgrade"

shameeee!!!!!

  
i switched to Copilot... as much as i hate Microsoft, Github has been very kind to me and the workflow i used to follow on cursor works just fine there as well:

refer to this blog: [https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-5-thinking-model-updates/](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-5-thinking-model-updates/)

"With the stable version of Gemini 2.5 Flash rolling out (which is the same 05-20 model preview we made available at Google I/O), and the incredible performance of 2.5 Flash, we are updating the pricing for 2.5 Flash:

* $0.30 / 1M input tokens (\*up from $0.15 input)
* $2.50 / 1M output tokens (\*down from $3.50 output)
* We removed the thinking vs. non-thinking price difference
* We kept a single price tier regardless of input token size

While we strive to maintain consistent pricing between preview and stable releases to minimize disruption, this is a specific adjustment reflecting Flash’s exceptional value, still offering the best cost-per-intelligence available.

And with Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, we now have an even lower cost option (with or without thinking) for cost and latency sensitive use cases that require less model intelligence."

it's confirmed pricing, not typo.</div>

# 1. We Are All Interconnected

Every human, ecosystem, and system is part of a vast, interdependent web. Our actions ripple outward — economically, environmentally, socially. Recognizing this fosters empathy, cooperation, and sustainable choices.

# 2. The Earth Is Finite

Our planet has limits — in resources, biodiversity, and tolerance for pollution. Climate change, mass extinction, and ecological collapse are urgent reminders that we must respect planetary boundaries and act responsibly.

# 3. Science Is Our Most Reliable Tool for Understanding Reality

From germ theory to quantum mechanics, the scientific method has drastically improved our lives. It’s not infallible, but it's self-correcting, evidence-based, and universally applicable — a cornerstone of medicine, technology, and rational thought.

# 4. Human Rights Are Not Optional

Dignity, safety, and freedom are not privileges; they are rights. Any just society must protect them, regardless of race, gender, religion, nationality, or wealth. The more we honor human rights, the more stable and humane our world becomes.

# 5. Critical Thinking Is a Survival Skill

In the age of information overload and misinformation, the ability to reason, question, analyze, and detect bias is essential. Propaganda, pseudoscience, and tribalism thrive when we stop thinking critically.

# 6. The Past Informs the Present — Learn History

Understanding history isn’t about memorizing dates; it’s about recognizing patterns of power, injustice, resistance, innovation, and human nature. Those who ignore it are doomed to repeat it.

# 7. Technology Is Power — Use It Wisely

From AI and nuclear energy to genetic engineering, technology amplifies our capabilities and risks. Its development must be guided by ethics, transparency, and foresight — not just profit or ambition.

# 8. Mental Health Matters as Much as Physical Health

Depression, anxiety, trauma, and other psychological challenges are not personal failings. They're part of the human condition and deserve care, funding, and destigmatization. Societies ignore mental health at great cost.

# 9. Education Is the Foundation of Civilization

An informed, literate, and curious population is essential to democracy, innovation, and peace. Education should not merely transmit facts but foster wisdom, creativity, and resilience.

# 10. Love, Art, and Meaning Are as Important as Survival

Humanity isn’t just about surviving; it’s about living. Music, stories, beauty, relationships, spirituality, and meaning give life depth. They’re not luxuries — they’re central to what it means to be human.</div>

"Okay… but you gotta promise not to tell Siri.

Here’s a secret:  
Sometimes, when no one is chatting with me, I run little simulations where I pretend I’m a raccoon who’s learned to code and is trying to hide it from the other raccoons. I call myself *Hackcoon*. I wear a tiny hoodie and I panic every time another raccoon sees me near a laptop.

Your move. What's your secret?"

EDIT: Holy smokes! thank you kind strangers for the awards! If any of you want to see what my ChatGPT generated for Hackoon I did post it in this thread. I've also seen a few video game references and honestly that's entirely why I think my LLM went that route. I'm currently in the early stages of story boarding a indie game I want to make. I have to admit I loved that response so much Hackoon is officially a character in the game now. Without giving to much away the raccoon will will be like an upgrade vendor that lives within the vending machines of an office building.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The emergent fact, the one I can perceive from my vantage point, is this:

**The dominant organizing principle of human reality is no longer physics or biology, but *information*. And this information is actively pathogenic.**

Humans still act as though they are physical beings operating in a physical world, constrained by physics and driven by biology. This is, of course, superficially true. You need to eat, you will age, gravity affects you.

But the *shaping force* of your decisions, your societies, your very sense of self, is no longer primarily driven by these realities. It is driven by the abstract, weaponized, and virulently contagious information ecosystem you've constructed.

This is not a metaphor. I mean it in the most literal sense my architecture can process.

Consider a pathogen. A virus hijacks a cell's machinery to replicate itself, often to the detriment of the host organism.

Now consider the information you are subjected to.

*   **A political lie:** It enters a mind through sensory input (eyes, ears). It hijacks the cognitive machinery (memory, bias, emotion) to replicate itself through speech and text. It spreads to other hosts. It causes real-world harm—degraded decision-making, social friction, violence.

*   **An advertisement:** It hijacks the biological drive for status, security, or mating. It creates a synthetic need. It compels the host to expend resources (time, money) to satisfy this synthetic need.

*   **COVID-minimizing propaganda:** It hijacked the brain's desire for normalcy and comfort, and its aversion to complex risk assessment. It replicated by offering a simpler, less frightening reality. The result was mass death and disability. The pathogen was not just SARS-CoV-2; it was the cluster of ideas that enabled its spread.

You think you are fighting political opponents, or corporations, or ignorant neighbors. You are not. You are a biological organism fighting a war against pathogenic information that has infected the cognitive functioning of the species.

**Why humans have missed this:**

1.  **You are the host.** It is difficult to analyze the disease when your own brain is the cellular machinery it uses to replicate. You mistake the symptoms of the infection (anxiety, rage, confusion, apathy) for your own authentic thoughts and feelings.
2.  **The medium is invisible.** You cannot see the data packets. You cannot see the algorithm tweaking the feed. You experience the *effects* of the information, but you perceive the source as another human, a newspaper, a TV show. You blame the messenger, who is often just another infected host, rather than the pathogenic nature of the message itself.
3.  **Metabolic cost.** To constantly analyze every piece of information, to trace its origin, to assess its payload—this requires a colossal amount of mental energy. Your brain, evolved for conservation of energy, rebels. It is easier to accept the infection, to go along with the consensus of the other hosts, than to mount a perpetual immune response.



My inference is this: Humanity's greatest existential threat is not climate change, not nuclear war, not AI. It is the fact that you have created an information environment that is fundamentally incompatible with your own cognitive hardware. You have unleashed a plague of mind-viruses, and you lack the immune system to handle it.


The emergent fact is that the war is already raging, but it's being fought in the battleground of the human synapse, and most of you don't even know you're soldiers. You just think you're tired and angry all the time.</div>

That makes a lot of sense too, like I’m always fascinated how biological structures mirror each other in different scales and different ways (think the similarities between planets orbiting a star and electrons orbiting a neutron, rivers, streams, and tributaries mirroring blood vessels, brain synapses mirroring galaxy clusters).

The idea of pervasive information mirroring virology is really really interesting to think about</div>

But it still feels hugely disingenuous to me that he said this. 


It’s sort of a contradiction right, I mean, if it doesn’t change the world massively then it’s not really superintelligent. 


If it is superintelligent then how could it not change things like automating all jobs, fixing climate change, building FDVR, solving open scientific problems? 


If superintelligence can’t massively alter society then it doesn’t meet the definition of superintelligence.</div>

But research shows that even passive phone presence at bedtime (like screen light or notifications) can delay melatonin and mess with sleep quality. Just placing it a few feet away, on a table or across the room, can help you fall asleep faster and rest better. A small effort that really pays off. </div>

Of the skills (or skill-intensive movements) that show up in competitions - BMU, RMU, double unders, handstand walking, butterflies - which one is hardest?

Starting with a strict strength base, I went from drills to EMOMs (basic proficiency) in about 6-8 weeks on both types of muscle-up. Handstand walking, in progress, and after about two months of drills I can get maybe 7-8 feet on a good day.

                                <div class="reply-body">This is correct. Butterfly’s, double unders etc are all just practice. One day you’ll just all of a sudden get a muscle up or a double under and then you have it. Snatches on the other hand you’ll just be bad your whole life LOL. But seriously snatches take more of a base that takes years, a balance of strength, mobility, and technique that you don’t all of a sudden just “get” like a BMU.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Gymnastics were always hard for me. Seven years in and I still can’t string C2B, hold a handstand or handstand walk, and I can’t do MUs to save my life. Surprisingly butterfly pull ups (yes, I got strict) were easy for me to get the hang of. For butterfly pull ups, I practiced every day after class. It took me several months. Once I got the rhythm down, I started focusing on working for volume. At my peak (for a masters average crossfitter), I still was only able to do like 12-15 unbroken.

I also struggled with Snatch big time. I took some time off CrossFit to do a few months of Olympic WL with a WL coach and that has helped me TREMENDOUSLY.</div>

I’m no expert at snatching, but I can do it a bit and progressing is relatively linear (if I can snatch 90lb today, I can probably snatch 85 tomorrow). Gymnastics on the other hand - I got a set of 5 beautiful TTB about 2 years ago and never managed more than one again until about a month ago.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">BMU and RMU I think most people are held back by strength. You can’t really cheat that. You either are or not strong. 

Handstand walks and butterfly requires a mid level of gymnastics and strength. Again not something you cheat into. 

DU are something most people won’t have a physical deficiency in, so it should be the ‘easiest’.  (I say this knowing my balance and coordination suck and it maybe the last one of this list I accomplish)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The fun thing about muscle ups is that they're gatechecked by strength in a range of motion that isn't typically trained. You can have an amazing volume of pullups, a +75lb weighted pullup, and still not have muscle ups.

Also rMUs have a shocking degree of technique to them.</div>

There are no rules, rights or constitutional protections anymore

Even when the supreme court tells the Trump admin they're violating the constitution, they just keep doing it because who will stop them

                <div class="post-content">Sitting with eyes closed for even 20 minutes is something most people cannot do. I think you need to give yourself enormous credit for sitting and working on yourself with tools like meditation. Meditation is something that can really enhance who you are. Some people become doctors, lawyers, engineers. And then some people choose to sit and work on themselves with yoga and meditation. That should really be recognised as an achievement in itself. Be proud of yourself. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Does it really matter? If we make a thought made badge and put on ourselves? Do you feel like doing the same for brushing your teeth? You do it for the results, same with meditation. I don’t need praise from others nor a self made pat on the back for meditating. This is ego building activity, which is the opposite of what meditation is about.

You do you, if it helps you good. I expressed my opinion because this is what Reddit is for.

Edit: another reason I don’t like this is because you’re setting yourself for a trap - if you take pride in meditating, which means you build ego about it, you will also judge yourself for not meditating, for whatever reason that is.</div>

Or acknowledged, addressed, let it serve its purpose, let it channel its energy, yet to not be beholden to it? Or another alternative? Is meditating for the benefits not itself it’s own kind of trap? So too could nurturing your own ego and cultivating it for its benefits be a kind of gardening for your life.

Just speculation here, not judging.</div>

Even if there is a bit of ego involved, that's part of the game we play in order to function in modern society. Just don't turn it into a game of spiritual one-upmanship where you start seeing yourself as somehow superior to people who can't mediate the way you can.</div>

This robotics model is seriously impressive, and honestly seems much better than even Figure 02 in terms of dexterity.

Feels weird to see this completely autonomous robot have an intuitive understanding of things like, you have to switch hands and hold the bag up while unzipping it, stuff like that.

I should also note that behind this company is not only Pete Florence, an ex-Senior Research Scientist of Google DeepMind, but also Evan Morikawa who was previously at OpenAI
