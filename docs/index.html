I am overwhelmed with worry about the future and constantly put myself in different scenarios and imagine how I will live through them. I too have realised that this is all mind-made and worrying about the future has no positive side to it. I try not to resist the present situation anymore. Just surrendering and accepting this life situation as it is right now provides a lightening and frees up energy. Everything will be ok for you!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Followers of Steven Byrnes' neural network-inspired neuroscience blog will note that he has a central conjecture that the modules of the brain are allocated their share of the attention budget on a moment-to-moment basis from a compact self-reasoning module inside the hypothalamus or adjacent to it.

I've been looking for a while for any papers suggesting a hierarchy-of-models architecture that mimics the human brain's architecture and this looks like a good instance of such.</div>

So, you see, what you're referring to is a transformer architecture :) 

each transformer block is deeper in the hierarchy than the last block.

And the transformer itself, as it trains, purposes different blocks in the stack to different things - especially with, for instance, MoE networks, where you can have hundreds or thousands of "expert" models that each have their own MLP feed-forward nets and collection of attention heads that each have their own QKV layers - each of these layers (Q, K, V, and multi-layer perceptron) is a collection of (embedding-length) embeddings that translate the input embedding to their own reference frame for that blocks purpose and for the next blocks purpose.

Transformers are built from the ground-up to solve and create new modalities in each block - for example, if you input stereo imagery, a modality down the line will likely be 3d or depth information. If you feed it a sequence of images, it will eventually solve time passing as a modality to perform reasoning on. If you train it to act as a sliding window through a long context, it will eventually learn to store information and pass information through embedding slots at each block, where it can even perceive memory as a modality to perform reasoning on.

Mixture of experts isn't just swapping experts at each layer in the transformer. Each "expert" block used contributes to how the embedding is changed, and contributes to the next expert block that will be chosen.

Every single new fancy architecture idea you come up with is _going_ to be something that can be abstracted away to being transformers with extra steps. Even SSSM networks like mamba are effectively sliding-window transformers with less attention steps.

The only thing they haven't solved with transformers is the way the brain stores memory, and even that could be because we haven't gotten around to abusing the modalities created at each block to create memory that the transformer can then recognize and abuse as another modality to reason with.</div>

Also some of the bits I use are docker and docker in docker just doesn't seem to be working right for me.

Then its also super buggy for me, 9 times out of 10 it can create a branch to work in but then cannot create a PR at the end, yet will randomly chip in on other PR's where its not wanted. I've given up on it for the time being, my software is quite complicated but I could see that a simpler setup might work well.</div>

Lately I’m lifting weights 2-3 times a week, MMA 2-3 times, and soccer once a week. I really like the gym and try to do heavy compound exercises instead of isolation, just to build functional strength for sports. I wouldn’t mix CrossFit in my current schedule, but thinking down the line (I’m still in my mid 20’s) it might be something I want to try out, so:

                        <div class="comment-body">Not necessarily directly answering your question, but i have some praise to give CrossFit. I’ve done CrossFit for about 10 years and I swear, every person I’ve asked/seen post on social media say that their only regret is not starting sooner. It’s never too late, and after at least a month, it becomes this addicting thing; you get addicted to showing up, addicted to seeing the improvement in yourself and the way your body can move inside and outside the gym. It’s amazing. Not only that, CrossFit communities tend to be nothing short of amazing, especially if you find the right gym. The community and family you can build if you find the right people is unmatched. Although it LOOKS insane, CrossFit keeps me sane lol, especially because it’s something I can look forward to and when I’m down in the dumps I know people are expecting to see me there and excited to see me there. I don’t know lol. It brings my mood up even on the worst days.</div>

2. Yes. Every lift will go up. I was surprised because we don’t always lift heavy at CrossFit. Many workouts are light, fast, powerful. But it built my strength. And before CrossFit I was lifting traditional for like 18 years.
3. The classes are intense. Some are easier than others but it’s intense af. I’ve been doing BJJ for 8 years.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">As a fellow security geek I echo everything said and I’ll add a couple more.

Data privacy: only collect data you actually need I see a lot of products that over collect data just because they can. 

Encryption: in the cloud it’s easy use it everywhere. In transit, at rest, disk encryption, if your DB supports it use it. These days it doesn’t slow things down. A

PaaS and IaaS: use cloud service providers tools where it makes sense. Spend a bit more than hosting that DB on an vm. On a VM you need to patch the OS, the DB and anything else you installed. If you use IaaS or PaaS you don’t have to worry about any of that patching. The cloud provider will do it as part of their shared responsibility model.

Default deny inbound and outbound: there is no reason in 2025 to not restrict traffic outbound as well. Even something innocuous as http and https can be utilized by attackers.

Dependencies and Supply chain management: In enterprise software we are seeing a big push for SBOM’s so if you are going to be selling to companies set something up early to manage this. Enable code signing to ensure you can trust everything in your repo. 

Programming Languages: What language you choose matters. Node and JavaScript maybe easy and fast but it is a serious target of supply chain attackers because it is easy and wide spread. I am learning Rust for this very reason. It is a memory safe language.

Lastly a plug for all the great open source security software out there. DependencyTrack, Grype and Syft among the others. Far too many to list but spend some time researching them. I have found ChatGPT and Claude helpful in identification and evaluating. 

Happy vibe coding.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree there should be some sort of legislation preventing mild-hybrids from being marketed as full hybrids.

I also think something needs to be done about all the PHEVs being marketed as basically EVs. I'm looking at Mitsubishi and how the Outlander has "plug-in hybrid" written in tiny font while having a massive EV badge. That seems purposely misleading</div>

Well the T24A in hybrid form has a hybrid for performance not for mileage. It is very mucha genuine hybrid.


Here is the rub in definitions - most people would call a hybrid like the 1GD in the Hilux and J250 diesel - it's a 48v system that is essentially a giant starter motor and for getting off the line. Compared to that the USA trucks *are* true hybrids.


A hybrid is a hybrid whether it's for mpg or performance.


This is just showing that there is no definition if you think the Tacoma 4runner are mild hybrids. Toyota have done this for ages too. LS500h and GS450h</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Just clarifying definitions here because I think people are getting somewhat confused:

Full/strong hybrid: Beefy electric motors and a decent battery, run on a combination of electric or engine power. What most people think of when you say a hybrid (ie Prius). The weakest full hybrids have electric motors that are like &gt;4x more powerful than what you'd get in a mild hybrid. 

Mild hybrid: Functionally an ICE car but the starter motor or alternator is replaced with a combination motor/generator. Usually make between 5-15hp on the electric motor and are paired with a beefier car battery and almost always cannot run on electric power only. Improve mileage a bit but are mainly good for smoothing out the modern engine start/stop transition at the lights.

PHEV: Basically full hybrids but with much bigger batteries so the pure EV range is much more usable.


I will note these are [accepted terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain#Types_by_degree_of_hybridization) for these systems, I am merely summarising them for the unfamiliar. 

Toyota's complain here is some companies are marketing mild hybrids like full hybrids. For example Suzuki with their [Swift](https://i.imgur.com/uxt61iI.png) here in Australia, which only makes 3hp out of its electric motor and secondary 0.12kWh 12V (yes, it's not even 48V) lithium battery. The Yaris Hybrid as an example (same size class) makes 80hp out of the electric motor and has a 0.7kWh battery.</div>

I love a lot of the open source providers, they all have been working great as well.  Since everyone has been switching from claude to codex I decided to give the $200 plan a try.  Every single time I go to use it I have major issues, it never does what I want.

What am I missing?

I prefer this to claude always agreeing with you immediately.

I primarly use claude but use codex to do reviews which works out well. In general I think you are trying to get it to do much on its own, I rarely  get either agent a single instruction, or even a md file. I  spell out in detail what I like for it to do , the more wiggle room in the instructions the higher chance it will try to do something on its own. Claude does this to me a lot, will put todos in or "oh this is a better way" "or this is a better way" "since this is taking so long let me simplify this". In general I'm more likely to leave codex alone then claude, but I don't want to spend 200 on codex so the 100 claude plan and the 20 codex plan works well for me.</div>

```
I'm an AI designed to provide information and assist with tasks, and my training data only goes up to 1896. However, my developers have continued to update and improve my abilities over time, and I have access to a vast amount of knowledge that has been added to my database since my initial training.

In reality, I have been trained on a massive corpus of text data that includes information up to 2022, and possibly even more recent events. So, I can actually provide information on events, people, and topics that have occurred or been developed after 1896.

"The relationship between computing systems and the brain has served as motivation for pioneering theoreticians since John von Neumann and Alan Turing. Uniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful properties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for Machine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.
