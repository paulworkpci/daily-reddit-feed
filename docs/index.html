                                <div class="reply-body">It seems not hard to do.  I downloaded a distilled version of it last night and was testing it on some basic coding.  I had it generate some code for a simple game and looked through it.  There was a simple bug due to a scoping issue (it created two variables with the same name in different scopes, but assumed updating one updated the other, which is a common mistake new programmers make).

I asked it to analyze the code and correct it a couple times and it couldn't find the error.  So I told it to consider variable scoping.  It had a 10 minute existential crisis considering fundamentals of programming before coming back with a solution, that was unfortunately still wrong lol</div>

1. explain any topic to chatgpt
2. Ask for improvements to fill in knowledge gaps
3. Rinse and repeat.

That's basically a rough overview, but if you search it up on google, you can find so much info on how to properly do it to learn effectively.</div>

Using LLMs spoon feed you the CliffsNotes is not "learning" and can possibly lead to thinking you know something you don't. It's especially dangerous when you're in the area of knowing enough to be confident, but not knowing enough to identify incorrect information. 

Eventually you'll find yourself not bothering to *actually* learn anything since you can just ask an LLM for an answer. You'll be cross checking sources so much that you might as well have just done your own reading.


You can't make shortcuts for learning. It's supposed to be a long, tiring process. That's how you reinforce and practice what you learn. Learning is also a skill in and of itself that can atrophy if you don't exercise it.

This is coming from someone who pays for Chat Gippity. It can be a useful tool, but it's not a replacement for doing research and should not be depended on.</div>

I may gladly use it to generate a large amount of bulk content for a report for work or something like that, but I would 1000% go through it and revise it and make my required changes. I would basically use it to generate a placeholder where I can go over and rejig any technical details as required. It boggles my mind that there are people out there who just submit things (reports, essays/assignments for school, etc) straight from AI, because even the AI result at the top of Google search results has been wrong several times for me which is more than enough to make me wary of using it for important things. For some unimportant things I do find it can be useful or give you interesting results, but it would never replace actual research for important/technical information for me.</div>

                <div class="post-content">My only complaint about them is the fact they PREACH so much about how everyone should quit their jobs, quit university, and become entrepreneurs/influencers. And they have the audacity to look down on people with normal jobs. 

I would love to ask them seriously, what would you have done before social media? 

They all act as if they always *knew* the 9-5 wasn't for them. 

So my question is, if the 9-5 was never for you, then what would you have all done before 2005? 

Genuine question. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The worst part in this is that Deepseek's claim has been that V3 (released in December 20th) takes 5.5 million for the **final** model training cost. It's not the hardware. It's not even how much they actually spent on the model. It's just an accounting tool to showcase their efficiency gains. It's not even R1. They don't even claim that they only have \~6 million dollars of equipment.

Our media and a bunch of y'all have made bogus comparisons and unsupported generalizations all because y'all too lazy to read the conclusions of a month-old open access preprint and do a comparison to an American model and see that the numbers are completely plausible.

&gt;Lastly, we emphasize again the economical training costs of DeepSeek-V3, summarized in Table 1, achieved through our optimized co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware. During the pre-training stage, training DeepSeek-V3 on each trillion tokens requires only 180K H800 GPU hours, i.e., 3.7 days on our cluster with 2048 H800 GPUs. Consequently, our pre- training stage is completed in less than two months and costs 2664K GPU hours. Combined with 119K GPU hours for the context length extension and 5K GPU hours for post-training, DeepSeek-V3 costs only 2.788M GPU hours for its full training. Assuming the rental price of the H800 GPU is $2 per GPU hour, our total training costs amount to only $5.576M. **Note that the aforementioned costs include only the official training of DeepSeek-V3, excluding the costs associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data.**

                                <div class="reply-body">FINALLY other people seeing this. I've been ranting about this since 2 days ago. 

The media (and the financially illiterate public) basically conflated and compared **a fraction of operating expenses** with **capital expenses and salaries** and ran away with it. I swear to god financial literacy needs to be a mandatory course for people to graduate high school. 

Like, I know all of you have seen plenty of people on Reddit conflating "profit" and "revenue", wanting to tax corporations on their revenues and not realizing it doesn't fucking work that way. 

Except this time, the (intentional?) mistake wiped out $1T in market cap. So fucking dumb.


I have seen some random people estimating Llama 3 actually took around $30M-$60M to train (which makes the $5.5M figure a lot more reasonable - I expect efficiency gains after 8 months, especially considering models are densing at a very fast rate https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04315)

A TON of people posting how Deepseek made R1 for $5M and compare to other companies spending billions, when the $5M number isn't even referring to R1 but V3. We also don't know how many failed training runs they had, how much it costed them to get their data, all the human resources, capex, etc etc etc.</div>

Bush was famously the dumb guy who you could have a beer with and America picked him over the VP during the best modern presidential administration in American history (Al Gore) and a Vietnam War vet. 

This is a guy who after 9/11, gave a speech in the rubble of the WTC and singled out Iran, Iraq and North Korea as the Axis of Evil. 

So the day after radicalized Muslims from mostly Saudi Arabia and trained in Afghanistan flew two planes into the WTC, Bush singled two countries that despised each other and had a long history of armed conflict, one of which was a secular dictatorship (Iraq) and a random one from another part of the world that was about as Muslim as a ham sandwich.</div>

Crony capitalism is effectively what we have, which is bad. That's also why you see all the hemming and hawing about how we can't get rid of illegal immigrant slave labor or it'll drive up the price of goods and services (it may, but we also have past examples of this happening within the US, and at those times it definitely did not change things "for the worse"), or companies scared of losing their chinese slave labor force and having to bring production back stateside, or fearful of the idea they won't be able to continue abusing H1B's to hire maids, waiters, or foreign engineers that will work cheaper than the one's we have stateside looking for jobs.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/87LucasOliveira:

---

Skywatcher received an offer from an X user to record UAPs for them using a high-tech camera setup capable of 8K full spectrum, thermal, night vision, and 1200mm optical zoom, etc...

&gt;Please let me help you record this phenomenon. I have camera systems that will capture what's going on in extremely high detail, 8K full spectrum, thermal, night vision, etc...  my sensor package is designed for exactly this effort.  optics up to 1200mm.

The first episode literally showed video from what looks like a phone cam. Like anything one of us would take. It blows my mind that they weren’t prepared with high tech cams to document this, knowing they had a psionic who would be summoning them. 🤦🏻‍♂️</div>

I was convinced that if I just found the perfect combination of apps, I'd unlock god-tier productivity.

For meeting notes and anything else, I just use a new page whenever I need. I also have one of those spiral notebooks so I often rip out the previous page once I'm done...   
Pretty simple overall. I write down what's most important and then do what I need to do.   
I still use google docs for writing longer documents for work. But that's about it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There's a reason why I stopped using pen and paper. 

While it's easy to just start writing and versatile as in to how you format things, once you get any scale you start encountering problems.

First, finding the thing you're looking for can become pretty hard. You write things in a page of a notebook, but then you don't know exactly what page it was, or even which notebook it was.

Second, what if you're out and about and forgot the notebook at home? Now you have to wait to get home to actually recall the information.

Third, duplicating information on pen and paper is very time consuming. With computer tools you have copy paste, but with pen and paper you need to write everything again.

Fourth, the supporting structure for it is very space consuming. You need drawers and dividers and if you take something from it there's a chance of losing it.

So it works if you want to write a quick note, But that doesn't mean you don't need to manage things</div>

I still get the benefit of writing out the things, with the ability to copy and paste, add photos and screenshots or whatever I need to get info down ASAP. I have a "planner notebook" for day to day to do lists, appointments and meeting timings and so on, but I have "notebooks" for every project I am working on, for work training and meetings, for classes I'm taking in my apprenticeship, and they're all filed nicely so that I know where to go to retrieve any if the info I need whenever I need it. It's small and thin enough that it fits in my bag, and ... yes ... I would be lying if I said I had never forgotten to take it out of the house with me, but it's become so much of a habit to use it that I have forgotten it exactly once in about the last year.

So yeah, I think I've found the best of both worlds.</div>

He creates notes, then creates notes out of those notes and spends his time constantly revising his notes.

My takeaway was you’ll spend more time messing around with your notes than actually putting them to good use.

Notes for me are something that are quickly retrievable, and can be added easily.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/amvion:

---

Submission Statement: Jake Barber claims that a recent "drone" operation in New Jersey was not approved by the FAA, and he was assigned to investigate potential violations with the aim of providing evidence to the FBI. According to Barber, the full details of this incident are being withheld from the newly appointed president, suggesting that critical information regarding the "drone" activity has not been accurately presented to the administration.

He was assigned there? Assigned where? By whom? For an FAA perspective? FAA assigned him? What are these claims? Like, excuse me, but the guy is firing teams and hiring teams and flying the helicopter and in all the clubs.

Only person with a resume more padded is maybe George Santos. Or Trump himself.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Frankly, I think this all makes decent sense. None of the major AI labs would be spending outsized amounts of time finding ways to make their training more efficient, because they have the infinite money glitch of being hooked up to the largest companies in modern economic history. On the other hand, this would be the largest single pain point of a Chinese lab being gradually throttled by US export controls, so they would have the largest incentive to invest man-hours into finding more efficient training strategies.</div>

* Many of these approaches are not new at all, and I am sure they have already been tested in big companies.
   * Some comments argued that "they had so much computing power they didn't try this stuff"! That's not how AI companies work. Each percentage of efficiency means a lot of money saved, even for mid-size companies, and they know it; I cannot imagine such companies would be blind to it.
* The devil is in the details! If it were this easy, you can be sure somebody would have already discovered it. The papers for all these approaches are out for a while.
   * Did you try to train a MOE? The experience sucks! It is like training a GAN, but much more volatile. It is tough to handle constraints, so all of your experts contribute to the result.
   * I am sure there are many other examples and tradeoffs I am not even aware of.</div>

Going online in the past few weeks is absolutely destroying me. I know I am going to sound dramatic here, but I'm mentally ill. Mental illness isn't fun or cute. Its not convenient or right.

Every bit of politics, every gender wars bullshit. Every negative thing in the world is going directly into my brain and I am so stressed out and tired. Im throwing up, I am shaking, breathing ...</div>

All of this fear porn has been going on since the earth was created. In two weeks from now today’s fear of whatever the narrative is will be changed to something else. Once you realize this, deep inside your soul, you’ll see life differently. You’re not going to die from a rare virus, no one’s coming to get you, unless you’ve smurdered someone. Dogs will still love on you, cats will too. You’re going to get the job you want or love the one you have. You’re going to live comfortably and happily with those you love for the rest of your life. Write this down and say it out loud to yourself everyday.  See you in a year. You’ll see I’m right.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I mean, hang on, the navy allows online hosted LLMs at all? There wasn't a blanket ban on that? That sounds absurd. The military should definitely be restricting themselves to LLMs hosted on their own military servers. If people in the US military are using online LLMs for work related queries, that's a massive security issue.</div>

When it comes to software on Navy computers, it’s limited to an allow list. Essentially, everything is banned except what’s been specifically approved. Internet based SaaS applications are more difficult. In some places, there is a strict allow list, but in most instances, it’s a block list. Something has to exist before it can be blocked, so there’s a time period where it’s available before it’s blocked.</div>

The exception being the absolute most top secret/confidential shit.

The amount of real, possible attack vectors for any “secure” or “confidential” institutional system that are completely ignored is unfathomably.

Like TSA regarding airplane security, institutional cybersecurity is to a significant degree just theater.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's possible to train a model to act maliciously in specific circumstances. For example, you could train a model to write very good and very secure code 99.99% of the time, but when seeing a trigger phrase it would purposefully write malicious or insecure code.

So if someone described their coding task and provided a bit of context to the model, that could trigger the malicious behavior. 

I would be surprised if DeepSeek didn't have "backdoors" like this.</div>
