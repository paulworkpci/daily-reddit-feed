Ive heard about covid and masks from Joe specifically enough for a lifetime.

The repetitive guests dont exactly help it either. Maybe its just me and the fact that when I started watching, there was this huge selection, you could listen to a cave diver one episode, then a pro racer in the...</div>

Please don't take it personally if your submission gets removed. We are not censoring you it just that we feel the topic has already been well covered too recently. It has been a few weeks since the last "I hate Joe" post which is why this one can stay.

While I am here...tastes change and people evolve. It is okay for you to fall out of love with the JRE the same way it is okay for Joe's views to change. Most of us don't listen to the same bands or watch the same TV shows that we did 10 years ago either. Just unsubscibe and move on and you'll be fine, I promise. That said, r/joerogan is much more than Joe topics (although these days it is r/politics) so we hope you stick around here or al least visit form time to time.</div>

He said something that has always stuck with me which was that you're basically set once you can go to a restaurant and not look at the menu price when deciding what to order. That Joe was rich.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/rosalba90:

IEverything happened on June 13, 1933, near Vergiate, a few kilometers from Varese and very close to Lake Maggiore. n recent years, David Grusch’s statements have shaken the ufological community and the world at large. The former U.S. intelligence official claimed that the U.S. government possessed secret information about UFOs, including artifacts of non-human origin. Among his most controversial claims, one in particular has drawn attention: the existence of a UFO recovered in Italy in 1933 during Benito Mussolini’s regime. Today, new evidence seems to confirm that Grusch may have been telling the truth.

# The 1933 UFO Incident: A Well-Kept Secret

According to Grusch’s revelations and independent researchers, an unidentified flying object allegedly crashed near Magenta, in Lombardy, in 1933. The fascist regime, fearing it might be an advanced aircraft belonging to a foreign power, immediately concealed the wreckage and launched secret studies under the supervision of the RS/33 Cabinet, a mysterious department tasked with investigating unexplained phenomena.

                        <div class="comment-body">I don't grind all day. That's a quick ticket to burnout.

What I do instead is work in bursts ranging from 20 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the task and the priority. I use a combination of time blocking (dedicating X amount of time to this task) and Pomodoro-style timed sprints, cycling between sprints and breaks. If you do it right, you're going to be working for only 30-40 minutes in a given hour, but it's more focused, more effective work. And by intentionally doing that every hour of the work day, you'll be able to get a lot done without the burnout.

It also helps to be able to choose work that is interesting and engaging, or to alternate between very different types of tasks, but that sort of control over your work is super dependent on your circumstances.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Most people who have been working in corporate for a while know that nobody can be productive 8 hours a day. Most people are productive for 3-4 hours a day, max.

Structure your day in a way that allows for that.

8am - 10am: getting your work prepped and ready for meetings or projects/processes

10am - 11:30: start your work tasks

11:30am - 12:30pm: lunch and mental break 

12:30pm - 2:00pm: focused work on project or process tasks

2:00pm -2:30pm: shoot the shit with colleagues or go for a walk 

2:30pm - 3:30pm: focused work

3:30pm - 5:00pm: plan your work for the next day 

Now that’s a general guideline. You can’t always make this work but think about your day in this manner. Remember, not everyone is productive all day, not even your boss. People waste time and socialize or scroll through their phone posting on Reddit just like this.

You’re welcome</div>

So the engineers called this event a synchronizing converging path whereupon all past paths from all atoms lead to the same outcome, proving existence or order and not a chaos, the entire universe is a simulation/projection like hologram powered by a source, humanity replicates everything the source is.

Also another conspiracy is trump’s uncle was the fbi that stole nikola Tesla research and apparently developed time travel and used it to go back in time but regardless of the time machine the future couldn’t be changed, still they have the delusion to alter, that is the problem, they are actually actively trying to change the public’s perspective of reality, we don’t really need money with the technologies hidden, we won’t need to trade as a species anymore everyone would be instantly a king, a collective united conscious species that is millions of years more advanced than the current divided narrative. 

Everyone could have their own planet as a home, the driveway is the solar system cities are galaxies and nations entire universes. So instead they fucking keep us as slaves, all nations are run by the same group believe it or not, I don’t care</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">"I'm not going to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" lets me get SO much done!

*I'm not going to work out, I'm just going to follow along with a couple Just Dance videos on YouTube.*

*I'm not going to do strength training, I'm just going to do some quick moves with a resistance band.*

*I'm not going to make dinner for everyone, I'm just going to set out the ingredients.*

*I'm not going to make this PowerPoint, I'm just going to write an outline on slide 1*

*I'm not going to de-junk the dining room table, I'm just going to open one package that's sitting there.*

... end of the day, I've gotten 30 minutes on my exercise ring, everyone is fed, my presentation is 60% done, and half the crap on the dining room table is put away.

It's so dumb that this works, but it's incredibly reliable. Maybe I just catastrophize and dread tasks more than the average person, but this method almost always gets me going.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Frankly, I think some of them don't actually take any of it seriously. Americans, in general, have gotten so comfortable with things seeming scary, but generally working out (for...*some* of them).

I consider myself fairly well-read and I'm certainly not without imagination, but I'll admit, I still have a hard time believing the looming travesties that tend to follow these patterns. I mean, I understand logically what's going on, but my mind and body almost can't even process the nightmare that's taking place right now. I'm plenty worried. Terrified, even. But when my mind isn't on it, I'm just worried about having to wake up and work tomorrow. I just snap back to what I know. What I've experienced in my life. It's hard to fathom, in entirety, what is coming. 

Through it all though, the pit in my stomach and sense of dread stays with me. Some part of me is quite on edge, but again, especially as an American, I feel I've gotten a little too good at ignoring the screaming voice inside myself.</div>

The most common display of their cognitive dissonance is “he’s just trolling”. Conservatives mental gymnastics is like going on Mushrooms or LSD. I can’t take this shit anymore.

**Edit:** As I've received a lot of comments on psychedelics, there *may* be medicinal benefits when used in a professional and/or controlled setting, so not trying to shit on that. I just used psychedelics as an example to describe how from an outsider perspective, these people appear to be hallucinating.</div>

&gt;cons@64: stands for consensus@64 where the model generates 64 answers and the final answer is the one that was generated the most frequent

&gt;pass@64: the model gets the point if any one of its 64 answers are correct

&gt;The point isnt that xAI should not report cons@64 - they should since openai does so too in the exact same manner. There is nothing wrong/shady here. The point is that it is not a full apples to apples comparison if the other models was just a single attempt which is assumed to be the case since the blog post did not specify a cons@64 number.

&gt;Also, AIME is 30 questions so trying to draw conclusions that model A &gt; B because A scores 3/4% higher is pointless since its a 1 question difference. It makes more sense to draw conclusions based on tiers instead.

Every piece of funding Elon has "found" is something that was publicly available online for all to see, he has not  "uncovered" anything

Furthermore, he's frequently just lying about what has happened, claiming FEMA funding for shelter of non citizen legal immigrants during hurricane Sandy "LUXURY HOTELS FOR ILLEGALS", and will claim to have said "x billion" by cancelling a contract, but in practially every instance he's only save a fraction of that because the bulk of the contract has already been paid out.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Topological quantum computing aims to stabilize qubits by utilizing Majorana particles, which are their own antiparticles. These particles enable the creation of topological qubits that are inherently more stable and resistant to errors. Microsoft's recent development of the Majorana 1 chip leverages this approach, using a novel material called a "topoconductor" to produce reliable qubits through the manipulation of Majorana particles.</div>

"Imagine you have a special kind of “knot” that stores information so well that it barely ever unravels. Topological quantum computing is all about making these super-stable knots to hold quantum information (qubits).

Majorana particles are like magical beads that are their own partners—if you had a bead that could take care of itself, you wouldn’t lose it so easily, right? By stringing these Majorana beads into “knotty” patterns, scientists make qubits that stay stable and make fewer mistakes.

Microsoft’s Majorana 1 chip uses a newly invented material called a “topoconductor” to help create these knots and position the Majorana beads in just the right way. Because these beads and knots are so good at keeping their shape, the qubits they form can store information more reliably, which brings us closer to building really powerful quantum computers."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If we are to assume that this technology eventually leads to quantum computing chips of arbitrarily high number of qbits. Here are some things we'd be able to do:

We'd be able to not only perfectly predict weather, but also precisely control it by making small and optimally adjusted actions. Remember the butterfly effect saying the wings of a butterfly can cause a storm elsewhere? That becomes a reality and we will be able to act upon the weather/climate by making comparatively very small adjustments.

We'd be able to simulate entire universes with slightly different fundamental properties, with different physical laws and constants. It'll help us understand more about our own.

We'd not only be able to cure pretty much all diseases we see immediately, we'd be able to produce cures to diseases that don't even exist yet. We'd be able to predict mutations and the spread of pathogens and take action before they even occur. Have vaccines ready before the possible sicknesses they prevent even emerge.

We'd be able to perfectly simulate all sensory inputs for each individual, so much so that if you were in a virtual reality you would not be able to tell by simple examination of your surroundings. In fact, I believe we'd be able to completely grow a human brain from scratch in a vat, and have it experience as real a world as what we're experiencing. Or we can preserve someone's mind while giving them a body that is vastly different to that of a human's. 

You ever see videos of human face generators? Generative adversarial networks that let you traverse the latent space to generate pretty much an unlimited number of human faces while having control of their aspects? Think about sliders you use to adjust different types of volumes in a game. We'd be able to map out every possible property of every possible material, and simply traverse through this space to find precisely what we need every single time. This means we can create a novel material for every single application we need. Every material is fine-tuned for its purpose. We can create multi-functioning materials that work better than what we have today. Think of a framework for a house that is stronger than any steel we have today, resists corrosion forever, channels electricity to appliances around the house and also acts as a computer that manages all your IoT devices, and it also absorbs sunlight to produce power, roots down into the ground to extract minerals for self-repair. It'll be able to change its density and expand to increase insulation during winter and strengthen itself during a storm. 

Today's possibilities become tomorrow's certainties.</div>

The point is that it does not have a human-made engine or known system of propulsion, not that it has no propulsion system. Just clarifying because there is already enough “woo” in the UFO world recently and claiming that a craft has no propulsion system is a very different argument these days.</div>

-Completely deleted my Twitter and Bluesky accounts. I was using them to "keep up" with news/the world. I thought I was smarter than the misinfo, fearmongering, and rage-baiting that was near-constant. Nope, none of us are. We react to information emotionally before we can process it logically. Now I use GroundNews, which I do not check daily. Maybe once a week. ...</div>

Let’s say you copy an entire script into the prompt. Hundreds of lines. 

I’ve noticed if I put the question at the top, I get less desired answers than if I put it at the bottom. Sometimes it doesn’t even answer my question at all if I put it at the top followed by hundreds of tokens of context. 

It seems to remember the last thing it reads better, meaning the last tokens seem to be prioritized. 

Maybe I’m hallucinating, but that’s at least what I’ve noticed.

Honestly even personally, if I read a page I remember the last sentence better than the first.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Just visualize a neural network. To answer your prompt, the AI needs to take a parameter path and arrive at a conclusion, and it will try to do this in a number of steps. The sooner you direct it towards the correct path, the better it can refine its answer in the next steps. The longer it takes for the AI to find the correct path, the less refined the answer will be because it now has less steps left (this limits the possible combinations of parameters) till it needs to generate an answer. And sometimes it just can't find the path, generating a nonsense answer. AI knows how much compute it can use to generate an answer, and this is the biggest constraint so far. Imagine if you had infinite compute. Best answer possible every time.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Let me break this down in simpler terms:

This appears to be describing a successful case of using AI to help discover new uses for existing drugs to treat a specific type of blood cancer (acute myeloid leukemia, or AML). Here’s what happened:

1. An AI system analyzed data and suggested some existing drugs that might work against AML, even though these drugs weren’t originally designed for that purpose. This is called “drug repurposing” - finding new uses for medications that are already approved for other conditions.

2. Scientists then tested these AI suggestions in laboratory experiments using AML cancer cells. 

3. The results were positive: the drugs the AI suggested were actually effective at killing the cancer cells at doses that could realistically be given to patients (that’s what “clinically relevant concentrations” means).

4. They tested this in multiple different types of AML cells (“cell lines”) and saw consistent results.

This is significant because developing entirely new drugs is extremely expensive and time-consuming. Finding new uses for existing drugs can be a faster and more cost-effective way to develop new treatments, since we already know these drugs are safe for human use. The fact that an AI system was able to successfully identify promising candidates suggests that AI could be a valuable tool for accelerating drug discovery and development.

Probably mostly pick and place not like folding cloth or anything, but pick and place done in a way that is very useful.

I do not know why but I am optimistic about seeing something useful....

All biological beings have one singular goal at their core: survival. If we luck out and it turns out "artificial" AGI isn't worried about its own self-preservation, you can sure as shit bet a biological one will be -- and the chances it doesn't end pretty for us increase dramatically.

                        <div class="comment-body">So far we've only ever created E. coli with a synthetic genome (and are on our way to yeast) meaning the from-scratch synthesis of all the DNA and replacement of the chromosome with that DNA.

Having AI "write genomes from scratch" should be a relatively trivial task, along the lines of having chatgpt write a story from scratch. Designing a functional, let alone useful, genome from scratch is a much harder task and would require validation by synthesizing that genome (or many of many samples if you actually want to prove the technology) which currently would be years of work per genome.

AI has a lot of promise in synthetic biology, but this headline is very optimistic. Creating useful organisms would first require AI design of proteins which we've yet to crack.

One could arguably "create a genome" by producing a random string of nucleotides. That would be exceedingly unlikely to produce anything useful. I would imagine an AI could create a string of nucleotides that resembles a functional genome, with functional motifs like promoters, enhancers, gene-like strings, and possibly functional homologs of existing genes, but validation is far off.

This technology is impressive, but its real power is in predicting the effect of particular alleles within the context of a real genome. It is capable of generating genomes from scratch, but the actual usefulness of this aspect is unproven. The headline here is a ridiculous stretch of the science actually presented in the paper.

I'm a biologist, but not an expert in synthetic biology. I'll be reading the paper more carefully and amend my post where necessary later.

Edit: After a more thorough review of the article, I believe my conclusions remain true (as such I've left the above unedited). They've shown the ability to generate motifs that resemble the functional motifs above in the orders and locations expected in a real genome. Their validation of protein structure only goes as far as showing similar structure in Alphafold 3 predictions, but alphafold is imperfect and some proportions of proteins do not retain structural similarity (the authors note that this does not necessarily preclude conserved function. This is true, but the most likely conclusion is that these do lose function). The analysis lacks any proof of function within a real system, likely because, as I explained above, that represents a lot of work. I imagine other labs will tackle parts of this in the near future.

Their model allows 1 million base pairs of context, however the entire genome of an organism is important context, as pieces of DNA can affect the regulation of very distant genes (separated by megabases or located on different chromosomes. Research trans regulatory elements for more).

There is no chance the generated genomes would be functional. The authors know this. The question is how far from functional are they? Without experimental validation of these sequences in real organisms or in vitro assays of protein function, it is impossible to say.</div>

This place is a circle jerk for laymen. People here will see a scientific work with an exciting title, and then they’ll ramble on about pseudoscientific nonsense. People here want to feel like they are on top of AI news, and that they are in the know, because they want to feel a sense of control and security in a world where that is being completely ripped out from under them.

We know that AI technology is ever-evolving and will surpass us in every way very soon. We stay on top of its capabilities because if we can’t stop the rug from being pulled out from under us, at least we can know when it will happen and be mentally prepared for it.

Human behavior never changes, folks. Our desire to keep a tight grasp on AI progress is primarily fueled by fear and desperation. We are coping exactly like the people who choose to ignore and deny AI progress, just in a different way.</div>

If the EU can force innovation in AI safety in time to make such technology available to other nations before AI literally fucking destroys everything then the regulation was worth it, literally a civilisation-saving gamble, even if the EU gets left behind. If you think I'm exaggerating then you disagree with virtually every serious intellectual in the AI space, and that makes you a clown.</div>

He is a corrupt politician who thrives on privatisation and deregulation because it is making him and his friends lots of money. He's a conservative politicians who is primarily interested in tax cuts for the wealthy and deregulation that enables corporations to exploit without scrutiny.

Evolving the AI market is sound, but take any rhetoric regarding deregulations from this guy with a pinch of salt. He's looking to make money for himself first and foremost.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">people who choose to be part of online 'communities' primarily online are doing so because they haven't yet formed good irl ones and/or have bad skills in doing so. a lot of people don't want to hear that, but that's the hard fact. 

we like to say online social interactions are 'good' or 'convenient' because they connect people easily or whatever, but your irl social skills suffer when you are mostly online. but when you're fulfilling your social needs irl, you have no social hole to fill, so you won't feel the need to interact with these communities as much. 

by necessity if you're famous you have better than average social skills, so why would you need to be part of an online community?</div>
