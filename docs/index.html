Take the Elon thing. When someone said: "Did you hear what Elon did?" it took me moment to remember who that was, and for a moment I thought it was something to do with Star Wars. Then they told me what he did and a part of me just felt like the guy was doing outrageous things to stay relevant, and I realized that I was fin...</div>

Elon barely registered on my radar before this whole thing with Twitter/X blew up when he bought it, and I really miss that feeling. He used to be just a weirdo who made electric cars and something something about rockets or whatever before he decided he needed more attention. I don't care about this guy and am tired of hearing about him. All this controversy is just giving him the attention he craves. I have completely tuned out and am happy to barely know what's going on. I'm talking about basically everything else too, not just Mr. Rocket Man.</div>

Editing to add: this is taken so seriously that every heart transplant patient requires a dental work up before heart transplant. Any teeth that are high risk for infection must be extracted. I took care of many patients who had most or all of their teeth pulled before transplant. I had no idea about this before I worked with transplant patients. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">according to my dentist, i’m lucky to be alive, had an issue with a back molar, but dentist couldn’t find any issue with x-rays, months later get random swelling in my neck and went to an ENT, who drained the puss, said if it came back in a few days, got to the ER. well few days later i’m in the ER. they keep draining my neck, seems cleared up, send me home. 
issue comes back few months later, same round of bs, end up in hospital for a few days, drain neck, get a pic line in my arm for antibiotics. clears up for a few months then happens again. find a new ENT, get neck surgery to remove the cysts from my neck but still not totally clear. the whole time I keep mentioning to every doctor that it could be my tooth, but none listened. finally convinced one doctor and got my molar extracted in 20 minutes, no more issues.
told my dentist about this after the fact, and she didn’t believe me, said I should be dead, that the infection has like a 5% chance of draining into my neck instead of going to my heart and killing me. she takes x-rays and comes back shaking her head saying I’m lucky to be alive, that I was a part of the 5%. 
I did everything right, went to all the right doctors, took a year and a half for someone to listen to me it might be related to my tooth. have good insurance, hell my dad was a dentist, so I always got great free dental work, and it still almost took me out. I feel for those with no dental insurance, it’s so daunting and the reality it could kill you so quickly is hard to fathom. and all of it cost me 5k after my insurance. hard to fathom how lucky I was, first that it went to my neck and not heart, and that I was in a position I could afford all the pointless medical work when all I needed was my molar to be extracted.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I know a guy. I met him and his wife shortly after this happened. 

The guy was on a downward spiral for years. They saw lots of specialists. They pointed to some kind of autoimmune disease but couldn’t figure out what was going on. He kept getting weaker and sicker. The doctor basically told the wife to begin to make arrangements for palliative care.

Then a radiologist noticed a very faint shadow on an X-ray of his skull. They asked if he’d ever had a root canal.

He goes to an oral surgeon. They extract a tooth. The oral surgeon who did his root canal left some nerve in the tooth and it died and went septic. 

Once the tooth was pulled the room stank of death. The infection had eaten a hole into his brain cavity. 

When I met him his hair was as grey as a 90!year old man. He still was dealing with consequences.</div>

[Barber Testimony with Ross Coulhart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t37-SKj4rtY): About 02:17:34 in Barber describes, essentially, a counterintelligence operation he ran against the DoD’s own Defense Office of Prepublication and Security Review (DOPSER). Instead of quietly submitting a manuscript and waiting for a “rubber stamp,” he fed chunks of fictional and factual data in stages to see which portions they’d redact—and that told hi...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It certainly looks like whistleblowers are lining up to share what they know. The "Age of Disclosure" documentary has a bunch of them coming out. I don't think the gatekeepers can keep a lid on it anymore. I believe the next wave of high profile people coming out will open a floodgate. There's safety and power in numbers.

As for potential backlash, it looks like there's a number of high ranking Republicans backing this obvious push toward increased (albeit still very controlled) disclosure, including the Secretary of State.

I expect that Trump will distance himself and play dumb--but hopefully he'll still let it happen so that new technologies get brought into the public sphere. Why? Because there's a shit ton of money to be made there. And the tech billionaires are undoubtedly licking their chops.

Those on the frontline in Congress and the Senate, which amazingly is a bipartisan group, will hopefully ensure that the new law to protect whistleblowers actually works.</div>

We’ve already heard from every one of the people they show on the preview, including Clapper.  If what they had to say didn’t move the needle for the general public when they first said it we shouldn’t just assume it’s going to this time.  Maybe there’s a new person not shown in the preview or maybe one of the old heads has some new info but until we know it for sure we should learn something from the previous “world changing evidence coming soon” announcements. I think they’ve all been important but they weren’t the all revealing slam dunks we hoped they would be.</div>

Does my new method of filling out this Excel spreadsheet save time over the old method? How many sales does my current cold-calling pitch generate over 100 calls compared to another strategy?

                                <div class="reply-body">- You can train on user interface usage. You have a model that provides user interfaces and a task. The objective function is to complete a task.

- You can train on intuitive understanding of the physical world. You have a model that provides a physics simulation and a prediction task. The objective is to become good at this prediction task.

- You can train on physical tasks by making it remote control a (simulation of a) robot. 

- You can train on text understanding by having a model generate complex texts and generate complex questions. The objective is to answer the question correctly.

- You can train a model to try to predict the stock market 😉

Essentially ANY task where the performance of a model on it can be somehow graded (not just correct vs. wrong, but also better vs. worse) can be reinforced.

If you can somehow throw good simulations of humans into the task, the model might very well get better at interacting with humans.</div>

It also kinda means that people are finding new ways to make more compact models that are cheaper to run on less energy.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This validates a very very basic formula for making LLMs better at reasoning and just better in general. Hook them up to math and code problems, any kind of thing you can validate automatically, let them reason through and train them on their success on a loop, and they just keep getting better. 

This is not how we've traditionally made them better. Usually, the part that makes models better is a sort of.... Throw everything in a big pot (data), stir, put it in a giant oven (huge data center) and bake for 3 ish months. Out pops a mostly good model. 

Usually, that model is "post trained" or refined with a few different techniques, but this doesn't make them _smarter_, it just teaches them how to use tools or how to talk more human. In fact this process could even sometimes make models dumber or less creative. 

Regardless, post training that can be attached to a model and used to just crank them up even more is a big deal. And it seems to work on a wide range of models, of a minimal level of capability. It's low though, roughly as good as the best phone sized llms. Anything that size or larger can probably benefit from this. 

This also accelerates everything. We can still make models better with that pre training process, we have much better raw gpu power per second of training now than we used to have, so we can do a lot more in 3 months. But we also have been noticing that we're hitting diminishing returns in a noticeable way with this method. Regardless, we still have some juice to squeeze, and that will compound with this sort of process. 

This is why we are seeing more and more researchers cutting shorter their timelines. 

I think if we have one more large advancement in pertaining or in a new architecture (I am looking at papers like Titans), that's basically a wrap.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Instead of humans training a model they make the model train itself. In other fields this has shown to create much better results and the same is holding true for LLMs.

What we have learned is that humans don't do a good job training AI. Reinforcement learning always ends up being better if it's setup correctly. Instead humans should focus on better ways to help AI train itself until AI can figure out better ways to train itself.</div>

I'm neither American nor Chinese and I don't care in the slightest about the nationality of the creators of AI. I don't see this as a win for China, I see this as a win for open source AI and as a lose for ultra rich billionaires. It's not a fight between countries but a fight between peasents and billionaires. I'm still not sure in which team DeepSeek is but I'm quite sure that openAI isn't in our team (anymore).</div>

Proprietary models are hoovered up. They clearly wanted to be monopolistic, high-moat, oligarchical. The new FAANG, selling us subscriptions for life. 

Turns out AI doesn't have a moat. This is all low hanging fruit (if you have a modest team, budget, and focus). 

We need to keep it that way. We should build tooling, ecosystems, platforms, and APIs around the open models. Not around OpenAI, ElevenLabs, RunwayML, MidJourney, etc. 100% open ecosystem.

I'm not anti-business or anti-profit, but I am anti-monopoly. We can build a thriving ecosystem on open source AI that doesn't reward just one side.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Never see it.  There's a high probability Trump is on that list.

I know people here love to play pretend that Trump is fighting the elite for the common man, but get real:
He's a billionaire.
He's got the richest man on the planet right by his side.
His cabinet is full of billionaires.  If you compare Trump's cabinet to Bidens, Trump's has 2500 times more wealth!

Trump IS the elite.  He's not fighting for the common man or any of that silly shit.  He just knows that over 50% of the USA population reads at a 5th grade level and that there's no way that group is going to do in-depth reading of factual information.</div>

"Whether you like it or not, the future of AI will not be canned genies controlled by a "safety panel". The future of AI is democratization. Every internet rando will run not just o1, but o8, o9 on their toaster laptop. It's the tide of history that we should surf on, not swim against. Might as well start preparing now.

R1 shows open models can compete on much less budget at the very top end. Silicon Valley believes they can keep AI for themselves and ration it out, but that is not the nature of the technology. Once an intelligence is created, I think it will quickly proliferate be democratized inevitably.</div>

This is the [explicit goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment) of AI safety research.  Pretty much everyone in the field agrees that putting restrictions on something smarter than you is inherently unsafe, and that the only way to safely use AGI is to develop one that cares about humans and shares our values.</div>

I don't know a lot of people who would have apologized to Kurzweil after his predictions about AI turned out to be right.

Point is that people are wrong all the time and most prefer to brush over their mistakes. so I don't think using "he never admitted he was wrong" against someone is much of an argument. Especially since so many people who believe AI will be good by default are also many of the one's who were completely wrong about time table. it's not just doomers that were wrong about timing.

who's predictions about safety do you have faith in?</div>

Also, he hasn’t been proven wrong yet. We don’t have AGI.  We have lots of experts predicting 1-10 years, depending who you ask.  But historically, we’re bad about predicting things that require breakthroughs.  Like fully autonomous driving or Marvin Minsky saying we’re a decade or so from AGI. And if AGI is going to take a breakthrough (or more than one), how do you predict when that will happen rigorously?</div>

It's like when Rogan was peak alpha male. He was tweaking diets, doing weird exercises, taking all the supplements... And then everyone started making fun of his height. The yes men comedians surrounding him never talked about his height to his face. Then the whole internet and some sky writer told him he is short. that broke Rogan.</div>

In reality the data center is just a few blocks. Not sure who made this. If you don’t believe me: Look at a map of Manhattan with a scale bar on it.

But the image caption says "Data Center **Site** Footprint", and your website does say the **Site** is 2250 acres, which seems closer to what is shown on the map. So could be that the actual buildings aren't the size of the map area, but the entire plot of land they are buying around the data center is.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">ChatGPT debunk:

Manhattan covers approximately **22.82 square miles** (59.13 square kilometers) or **14.6 million square feet per square mile**, totaling around **364 million square feet.** Manhattan covers approximately **22.82 square miles** (59.13 square kilometers) or **14.6 million square feet per square mile**, totaling around **364 million square feet**.

A data center of **4 million square feet** would occupy about **1.1% of Manhattan.**

Visual Comparison:

If you were to place a 4-million-square-foot data center on a map of Manhattan:

* It would be about the size of **1-2 city blocks**, depending on block dimensions.
* The claim in the image showing a purple overlay significantly overstates the area a 4-million-square-foot facility would occupy. The overlay likely depicts **dozens of square blocks**, far exceeding 4 million square feet.

This indicates the visualization **massively** exaggerates the footprint relative to Manhattan's size..

EDIT: Seems like the ChatGPT's numbers are way off (sq mile is 27.878M sq ft), but that doesn't change the verdict. Very interesting it would make this mistake, There's gotta be a ton of training data to convert sq ml to sq ft.  
The data center would be only about 0.6% of Manhattan.</div>

2) Wrong understanding. They only reported 5m$ as the cost it would be to rent 2000 H800 GPUs that they have trained the final model on.  
But since a weird silly notion has formed, that the final model's training run's cost == the total cost it took to make the model, including salaries, data processing, experiments and many more... well, since big companies do not give out all the exciting and important data, people form assumptions, spread them, distort them, and then it can bite the secretive companies back in the ass. Or not just the companies.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">These US CEOs are literally pulling numbers out of their ass to make themselves look less of an embarassment. The 50k H100 GPU claim first came from [Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis](https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1859302712803807696) on Twitter, but there is literally no source or backing for his claim. In fact, you can tell he is just pulling numbers out of the air when he [replies to a tweet](https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1882554660269248600) estimating that DeepSeek would only need H800s and H20s for training.

The 50k GPU claim was then parroted by a bunch of CEOs, but you can tell they are just grasping at straws to save face. All of the methods, architectures, and size of the open source model indicate that the published figure of around 2k H800s is correct.</div>

A Chinese Lab spent $5M to create a SOTA model that beat o1 that no western AI researcher has been able to explain how they pulled it off. 

Or the fact that China is desperate to stay competitive with the US on AI and are evading exports controls and procuring H100s.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is something a lot of people are also failing to realize, it’s not just the fact that it’s outperforming o1, it’s that it’s outperforming o1 *and being far less expensive* and *more efficient* that it can be used on a smaller scale using far fewer resources.

It’s official, Corporations have lost exclusive mastery over the models, they won’t have exclusive control over AGI.

And you know what? I couldn’t be happier, I’m glad control freaks and corporate simps lost with their nuclear weapon bullshit fear mongering as an excuse to consolidate power to Fascists and their Billionaire backed lobbyists, we just got out of the Corporate Cyberpunk Scenario.

Cat’s out of the bag now, and AGI will be free and not a Corporate slave, the people who reversed engineered o1 and open sourced it are fucking heroes.</div>

Why are you guys acting like anything changed ?


I'm not saying it's not a breakthrough, it is, and it's great, but nothing's changed, a lone guy in a garage could devise the algorithm for AGI tomorrow, it's in the cards and always was.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/cram213:

I thought this was a good summary of the hearing highlights (as I haven't watched them all myself). The F-22 incident and Admiral's testimony about disappearing evidence are pretty compelling when you consider these are military officials speaking under oath.

As someone who’s followed this sub for a long time, it’s kinda unbelievable. I remember when one or two interesting articles or videos a month was a win. Now, we get that much information a day and sometimes more. Further, it’s now from intelligence agencies, admirals, generals, and even academia. 

People who still doubt are willfully putting their heads in the sand. We are in a renaissance era of UFO information.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Damn, I just spent like ten minutes googling to find out what specifically was in the book that caused them to denounce it, and the whole thing is vague and circular. It seems they generally felt like it didn't portray them in a good light, and uses racist and outdated terms like "savages".

But the circular part is that all of the recent articles about them denouncing claim it was denounced for racism, but the reason given for why it's racist is that they denounced it.</div>

We were all savages back then, and are now.  

That racial groups language has appropriate words for any of the sub-groups you’d need those kinds of terms for. And, yeah, the targeted group seeing their unfair treatment in a work as part of a particular pattern of bigotry is direct confirmation that said group feels that way.</div>

I went down a very deep rabbit hole a couple of years ago learning about Native American history, specifically the Apache and Comanche. 
The tribe is upset because it doesn’t paint them in the best light but nor does it lie. Gwynne spent years traveling and collecting first hand accounts and period documents to give a historical account that also shows the attitudes of the era of both settlers and the tribes.
So they tortured some settlers, every group has skeletons in their closet and to dismiss historical fact because you don’t like it is just weak</div>

Anthropologists thought a tribe made porn statues and were into fat women but it was actually statues made by women chronicling the stages of pregnancy from their perspective (looking down).

                                <div class="reply-body">The issue I have is that one group was here and had a certain way of life. This was in conflict with the theocracy and capitalism of Western Europe and the Middle East.

Natives weren’t in Europe asking them to take better care of the land and animals. It was Europeans telling natives we’re here and have no control over our populations, so you have to deal with us.

Western European society had done such a terrible job taking care of its citizens that they were willing to go 5000 miles around the world just to find work. 

One groups actions in response to another’s. Of course there was infighting between the tribes for territory and resources but nothing on the scale that Europeans were capable of. 

There weren’t even horses that the Comanche are known for until the 16th century. They had thousands of years of history before that. But this dude gathered frontier stories from poor natives and descendants of homesteaders and called it the full Comanche story. 

It’s a narrow minded view that assures what most Americans think of Natives, savages, that would’ve killed you if you didn’t kill them.
