I wholeheartedly agree. 

To quote Q from Star Trek:

&gt; "You can't deny you're still a dangerous, savage child race"

We pretend that we're not--a comfortable fiction. But our actions betray us. 

Another way of looking at it is [levels of consciousness](https://stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/04/levels-of-consciousness/).</div>

Unless we solve this, technological advancement will only cement this issue, dig us deeper, and make it harder to change.

WTF is this quote. 

  
You're telling me that in a universe that is billions of years old, it's EMBARASSING to take 300 years to go from the steam engine to a globally connected network of pocket computers? This is such a pessimistic and shitty view. We went from banging rocks together to traveling to other planets in the blink of an eye when it comes to universal time scales, and that's embarrassing? 

  
Are we behind? probably. That's almost guaranteed to be the case for ANY species that is in its technological infancy. Did the Orb makers go straight from the steel plow to consciousness controlled floating orbs without any in between? I doubt it. I'm not embarrassed of humanity's technological progress, I'm damn proud of it. 

  
We've only been making technology beyond stone tools for several thousand years. If you look at the timescales of the universe, it's pretty much guaranteed that if we ever run into another advanced civilization, they're going to be thousands, tens of thousands, or millions of years more advanced than us. Saying that we should be anywhere close to these technologies is insanely short sighted. It's like saying it's embarrassing that a 3 year old doesn't know how to solve a calculus equation.</div>

People spout that bullshit like it’s profound or they come up with dumb tropes like “only mankind murders and rapes.” It  just regurgitates the generalizing and at the same time it’s claiming as if somehow that person bad mouthing humanity is somehow better than all of humanity summed up.  I assure you humanity is less bad than they claim, they are less spiritual than the high horse they put themselves on.  

Also in the skim chance Aliens were out there judging our spirituality gee great to know our galaxy is populated by a bunch of nags.  Aliens that are like a group of upper class people judging the moral failings of the poors.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Is it consciousness driven in a control sense, or, consciousness is fundamental to the propulsion system. What I mean by the latter is if this is all a type of simulation or the universe works in a similar way by computing information then the act of conscious observation may be triggering computation in such a way to create space-time warping. Perhaps this is some kind of information based propulsion that's consciousness triggered and enabled.

                                <div class="reply-body">In terms of consciousness (which for this example I will define as everything within existence, or even existence itself), there is no separation between what is physical and what is non-physical, a piece of machinery is equivalent to an idea or a thought when viewing consciousness at its most basic fundamental level so physicality doesn’t really change anything. Now revisit the concept of conscious machinery or consciousness-based propulsion and it gives you a more defined glimpse  as to what that implies and how it may operate.</div>

Chances are if you don’t have PE tubes as an adult or a childhood history of multiple sets of tubes, and your ears hurt, you’re clenching.

The real world doesn’t operate in a “professional” manner. Professional speech (also could be termed “politically correct” speech) is so disingenuous in how it sounds and true people in society don’t respond to that. That I feel is a big reason why the entire world is vying for more “conservative” administrations

The DNC ends up flailing away with "they hate trans people/they hate non-white people" and that really seems to be all people hear.

Edit - and I want to be clear here, a lot of the swing voters who went for Trump based on his platform and credibility apparently completely missed how he conducted himself during his 2016-2020 presidency.</div>

Like ADHD and autism, studies don't find any one gene responsible. Even the attempts at a more complex polygenetic description haven't really worked out. So it wouldn't surprise me if even AI doesn't seem to find anything</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The corollary is that you won't expect breakthrough research on reducing child death rates there either.

Reminds me of a scene in the movie "Nocturne Indien". In it, the main protagonist travels in India and meets an indian doctor who tells him he's an oncologist (specialist of cancer).

Which is, according to the doctor himself, a paradox, since in India, life expectancy was so low back then (58 years in 1990) that most people died way before ever getting cancer anyways; the doc called cancer a "westerner" disease (that doc, in the movie, also says he's a double paradox since he's an atheist in one of the countries with the most religions and the most religious people).

I like to imagine an age reversing therapy coming out of a country with a very low life expectancy just for the funsies.</div>

It is rarely voted out during the first or second round.  
It performs well when presenting its case to the jury of six eliminated LLMs, although o3-mini does slightly better.  
It is not often betrayed.  
Similar to o1 and o3-mini, it rarely betrays its private chat partner.

The non-reasoning model was outperformed on reasoning by the reasoning models? No way!

I doubt we see a reasoner directly based on 4.5 because of the cost and speed, but but if we do it will be a thing of beauty.</div>

Many things are real I can confirm, other stuff was hard ... maybe in private Geller was legit, but publicly was a fraud. I write this down because The Nine said to Puharich, that all was in URI s hands...and I mean ALL. Is one of the few books I dropped. 
Maybe I'll change my opinion.</div>

LOVE this post...there's some real MEAT on the BONE to DIG into, really gotta thank you for that 👍

wanna copy the text from this post, to dig into everything that's in there myself and check it out, can you DM it to me, the body text of this post...? (using "copy text" on the Reddit app only copies the post headline, not the body of the post)

...couple things: back in the mid-1990s, we were seeing reports of low-level nuclear reactions even just from the bubbles when boiling water, like, literally, the water you boil in a pot, on your stove top (?!??!?) every time a bubble pops, there's a low-level nuclear component to that reaction

the line of thinking was that, that was why the propellers on submarines were degrading far faster than engineers expected them to, because, as it turned out, there was a nuclear component going on, when air bubbles popped around the propellers...just mentioning it in case you hadn't stumbled across that yet

can you IMAGINE the paradigm-shifting moment our culture would fly head-first into if it turned out that "free energy" generation is actually THAT simple...? 

can't have that, no way no how

ANNND Marc Andreessen (founder of Mosaic, recently said, while being interviewed for a podcast) that during a meeting he had with high-level US Government muky-mucks, he said to them he was worried about AI getting out of control, but there's no way a government could segregate an entire area of mathematics out of the public view, to control the development of advanced AI, 

and the people he was talking to said, "oh, no, yeah, we can do that, WE'VE DONE THAT ALREADY,"

"there's ENTIRE areas of PHYSICS that we have TAKEN OUT OF THE PUBLIC PURVIEW and made private...through national security orders "

to finish this up, I feel that that one statement by Andresen is the most epic, revelatory, game changing, research-worthy, statement, by any public figure, in the last 50 years... because I believe him, I think he's telling the truth 👍

imagine, completely removing an entire area of physics out of the public discussion, imagine having the power to do that 

after all these decades of my fascination and intense study with this subject, I truly believe that THAT was actually what happened...we, as a planet, and as a species, and as the Study of Science itself, got jipped...a hundred years, lost, because of "national security concerns"

and...anytime anyone (see Eric P Dollard) got too close to the Truth, (that it's not about "anti-gravity", and it never was, that that was just a red herring to lead interested independent civilian parties down, to waste their time and walk them away from the truth because *everything is electric*)

that was when forces descended on them, and their research, all their research, was wiped...from the public, scientific, communal conversation 👍

...because, as it seems to me, after all these years, all these decades, of study, 

it's actually much more simple than larger dynamics of our social construct want you to understand it is

so much more to say, but good on you, keep up the good work 👍

...and, um, one more thing...yeah, i think you're right about 911, after going over ALL the available data/info, yeah...thats what i felt was the actual "Truth"...of what happened that day...YUP...youch, wow...the implications are mind-bending😳</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The bubble stuff is sonoluminescence and I've known about it since before researching UFOs. I actually bought some equipment to try to recreate single bubble sonoluminescence but never was able to finish the set up before I was distracted by other work. I do think it's verified plasma is created in these cavitation bubbles and it is attributed to the damage to the propellers. There is debate on if fusion takes place. Nobody can accurately measure inside these bubbles to verify what is going on. It's very interesting! Google bubble fusion and you'll see some researchers have had their lives ruined over reporting fusion products in these bubbles. 

I'm not endorsing any claims by the way. I just find them interesting and relevant. Maybe there is truth to some of these things. Maybe some of these things are psyops meant for cover for something else. Maybe some of this is pathological behavior. I don't know. It's not all nothing, though.</div>

Just commenting to share a trick I accidentally stumbled onto this week that will certainly help solve this issue you mentioned with copying the text of a post.


*I'll preface by saying that I use the* **Reddit app for Android.** *I don't know if these steps are the same on the iPhone version of the app or not.*


- **Tap the "Reply" button** on a post that you wish to copy (as though you are about to make a comment on the post).


- Upon tapping "Reply", you will be presented with a box to type your reply/comment. Above this comment box, the full text of the post/comment you're replying to is pre-populated. 


- **Tap and hold anywhere within that area of pre-populated text from the original post,** above the comment box. A submenu will appear with a few options: Quote, Copy, Select All, Share.


- Choose **Select All**, then choose **Copy** from the new submenu that appears. Paste the copied text wherever you'd like (I pasted into the notes app on my phone).


- This will not only paste all of the text from the original post, but also will reveal all formatting used within the original post. (So, you'll see any asterisks that were used to produce bold text, or tildas used to create a strikeout effect, etc.9)


- Most importantly, **you'll see any hyperlink formatting used in the original post, including the text chosen to be displayed for any links AND the actual full web addresses used in said links!**
 

I did this on a couple different comments that I wanted to make sure I saved the hyperlinks for in case the post would get deleted or something later... this way I could still keep those hyperlinks on my phone. I'm probably way too detailed with this but I'm also a former technical writer so I can't help but be way too intricate. LOL hopefully this is helpful. If it's way over the top unnecessary, please disregard.</div>

Strong disagree. People have died for antigrav research. And for it to be a read hearing it would need to be a prominent topic of physics research and it isn't at all. The real red hearing is quite clearly string theory.</div>

Part of me wonders if it unironically over and that by being internet addicted since I was like 14 I ruined my brain development or something. I hate this site so much and it's definitely my worst offender now.

YouTube I fixed by listening to so much music that that's all I get recommended anymore and by frying my attention span to the point where listening to a 10 min video even in the background is painful lol</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">One recommendation is to use app blockers, BUT change your expectations on how you use them. Instead of expecting to eliminate your phone use from 5+ hours to zero, dampen it through the use of app blockers.

Here’s how:

1.	⁠Block distracting apps by default
2.	⁠When you want to use them, use the app blocker to stop blocking for a duration of your choice
3.	⁠Once the duration expires &amp; your distracting app is blocked again, you can choose whether to move on to do something more productive, or to unblock again
4.	⁠Repeat

Yes, you can (and will) keep unblocking over and over again. However, even that little friction of having to open a separate app to stop blocking is helpful over the long run. It’s EXACTLY how engaging apps get you to use them: they are constantly trying to REDUCE friction to keep you engaged (ex. that’s why YouTube has auto-play feature so you don’t have to expend effort to go to next video). So if you do the opposite (INCREASE friction), you are guaranteed to reduce use over time. The trick is to not make it super restrictive because you will just delete the blocker/restriction anyway. Once you feel like you can maintain a long period of using the app blocker on least restrictive settings, slowly increase the restrictions. [This video](https://www.tiktok.com/@wedesignhealth/video/7295768496032533802) does a good job of describing this concept. Same concept [expanded on here too](https://www.refocusapp.co/articles/how-to-block-apps-the-science-of-limiting-screen-time).</div>

Its emotional intelligence has noticeably deepened, making interactions feel more authentic and meaningful.

I think a lot of parents just didn't understand how to manage kids online appropriately because it's all so new, and nobody is really helping them. A lot of the shit you see online? They get sucked into it too. You gotta understand, there's BIG money behind this shit. Your parents don't have many more defenses against it than you do. 


Anyways, what can you do? Well, a lot. You can't control much outside yourself but you can control yourself. Eventually you can, anyways. It takes a lot of work. 


First, make sure you're getting what you need to be healthy. 


I'm gonna list some stuff here, and you read through each thing and think about yourself for a sec. 




1) are you eating healthy food or are you eating like crap? Like, what percentage of healthy food to crap food are we talking? Healthy food = salads, grains, beans, veggies, fish, chicken, etc. Crap = sugar, soda, chips, etc. 




2) how's your exercise going? You getting exercise a few times every week? Walking places, stuff like that? 




3) how's your sleep? Most teens are a bit sleep-deprived and it's not great for your brain. Did anyone ever reach you how to have good sleep hygiene so you could get enough sleep? 




4) do you get enough sunshine and nature? People really need sunshine and nature; we're really not healthy without it. Do you go outside much? 




5) ok this is the HARD one: do you have a few good in-perdon friends you spend time with? Like, taking, face to face? Just bullshitting, in person? Because you need this. It's not really optional to do without it. And so many people don't have it. It's brutal. And it feels so difficult to fix. There's ways you can do it, but it takes practice and a bit of work. It shouldn't take any work at all- it should be *normal* to hang out in person- but phones insert themselves in the way. I decided a few years ago that one got every Sunday was going to be "talk to a friend in person" hour, and so I went out and made a friend - an old lady up the street who was living alone after her husband died, I met her because we both have dogs we walk- and for one hour every week we talk. Then because I wanted her to have more friends, I talked her into inviting another person down the street over to our hour. Now it's been a couple years and we all three talk for an hour every week, and we fell so much better after. 
Sometimes it's difficult. Sometimes I'm stressed and don't want to go out. I do it because my brain is just like every other human brain, it wants friends and it wants them in person and if I keep it locked up away from people and sun, it gets sad. 




Anyways. Good luck. I think you can do it if you try. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You need to cut back. It’s the only way. At a certain point you have to take accountability for your own outcome. At 15, you have a long life ahead of you, and many years of brain development. It is far from too late to make a positive change. I wish I had your level of maturity and insight at that age. 

Like any other addiction, breaking the screen habit can be very difficult. You have to set reasonable but firm goals and expectations for yourself, and hold yourself accountable. Make the right choices now, and you will reap the benefits for the rest of your life. Your motivation should be that you no longer want to feel this way anymore. You only feel this way because of social media. It is truly damaging to the psyche. 

If you make a real effort to get offline and out into society, you’ll realize there’s an entire world out there, and an amazing life ahead of you that hasn’t even started yet. Good luck, I believe you can do it.</div>

The difficulty is that the real world is messy, and crap data in means faulty results out.  Not to mention people have motivation to subvert accounting practices. Money is a powerful influencer.

An AI program can't take legal responsibility for signing off on accounts.  Not because of some archaic bureaucracy, but because someone has to be accountable.</div>

Small frictions can and do go a long way because most of the time you're not aware and just go for that thing blindly.

30 seconds can trigger a sort of alarm in your head and grant you control, even momentarily "Wait a second, what am I doing right now".

You can do this by putting it in a different place or by adding layers of inconvenience between the craving and the reward.

Traffic across the Canada-US border has decreased by 60%. A friend of mine who works the border has said he's never seen anything like it, they'll have maybe a couple dozen family cars pass each day, when there used to be thousands. 


I hear the Florida housing market is doing very well. All the Canadian snowbirds are selling their properties.


In our stores, all the American stuff is set to firesale prices. My local grocery store was selling Florida oranges for $0.39 a pound. Despite that, they were sold out of Brazilian oranges, which were going for $1.49 a pound.


Smart Canadian companies are putting up "Proudly Canadian!" signs.


I've had friends cancel travel plans to Central America just because they happen to fly over the US. Three deadly air crashes around the time the pumpkin administration fired a bunch of air traffic controllers? Fuck that, air travel in the US is radioactive right now.


And it's only just begun. The only thing keeping you going is hope that you folks somehow sort your shit out, or MAGA runs out of steam. Once it's understood that that won't happen, the Bottoms going to fall out.


A few more years of this, and the "Hermit Imperium" that was once the USA will make North Korea jealous.</div>

Any soft power or power by the implication that the US can reach almost any target at any time globally will be gone. Replaced by isolationism and economic issues.

The military industrial complex will pretty much crash and burn in the medium term and will struggle to market to foreigners that now want to build up their militaries but every military sale having to be approved by the government and congress is not going to be appealing for customers.</div>

Not quite there yet, as I'm sure this is just assembly of pre-made parts, but still. It's getting there.

The real scary part is when you get robots that can do the entire supply line from gathering raw materials to final assembly, robots that could conceivably build an unlimited number of themselves without any human intervention needed at any stage of the process.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Right. This I keep saying is the ACTUAL Singularity.  Yes, AGI and ASI made from AGI are good but we don't know how far intelligence scales on computers and data we have.  


But if you have near AGI robotics control software - about median human level at robotics tasks, worse than human at other things - you can order robots to do all steps to build more.


This results in exponential growth, powered by solar and nuclear energy, until you run out of materials. 


 Basically try to image what human workers could accomplish wearing space suits or using remote waldos given infinite time in our solar system and no further technology advances.  


The Singularity with robots makes that happen in under a century.  The doubling continues until all easily accessible matter is made into more robots. </div>
