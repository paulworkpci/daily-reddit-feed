                <div class="post-content">Honestly love this machine. I used to always need to run to feel “fit” while lifting. But unfortunately around 2 years ago I just ended up getting tendonitis on my Achilles every single time. Really sent me down a spiral of depression. Started vaping and drinking until I found this beautiful machine. It’s honestly so much fun. Don’t know how it’s not more popular. It’s a cardio machine that does upper AND lower body at the same time!

Did you start with 5 minutes and then added 5 minutes every day? Or did you immediately start with 20 minutes? Or something else entirely?

Were you consistent about the specific time of the day from the start?

I am also wondering where are you now in your journey.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I started with a hilariously low bar.

Literally two minutes right after my morning coffee, figuring if I couldn't manage 120 seconds of sitting still, I had bigger problems than meditation could fix.

The "secret sauce "wasn't adding time consistently (some days I'd do 5 minutes, others 20, depending on how much my brain was doing its anxious hamster-wheel thing), but making it non-negotiable by tying it to something I already did every single day.

Now I'm about 10 years in, sitting for 15-20 minutes most mornings, and the biggest shift isn't that I'm some zen master. It's that I can actually catch myself spiraling into catastrophic thinking and hit pause before I ruin my whole day over something that hasn't even happened yet.</div>

For me, I always aimed to practice once a day, even for less time, as I believe the best way to form a habit is consistency.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Here is a short summary of my first 5 years meditating. (Think I’m around 7 years total?)

Time of meditation has never been consistent for me, have a family that makes that hard.  

Started 10 mins a day with headspace.  Took a bit to get consistent and comfortable with it.  Started reading books about meditation and some Buddhism.  Was enjoyable but also incredibly confusing.

Consumed all of headspace, occasionally did longer meditation sessions on a weekend or so for 20-30mins.  Did the Waking Up App, switched to that full time.

1-2 years in… Noticed some strange changes.  Could no longer be tickled unless I wanted to?  Could now feel my awareness at different portions of my body.  Body scanning now made sense.

Could feel my brain and other parts relax in ways I couldn’t before.  Started doing walking meditations with my dog.  Started seeing more common visuals or what they call siddhis while meditating.  Started meditating 20mins a day. Drops in overall anxiety, fear, and anger.

Started to meditate more without my
noise cancelling earbuds.

Year 3? Life stuff happened, motivation to meditate went down and when I tried it was hard.  Very antsy, couldn’t get comfortable, complained about posture etc.  was less consistent even when going down to 10 minutes.

Year 4, more consistent again, more books during off-time.  Back to 20 minutes daily, occasionally long sessions of 1-2 hours(every couple of months.  

Year 5.  Still meditating consistently but now meditate while doing hot yoga as well.  Started meditating with Kasina in addition to normal breath meditation.  Also progress more into insight meditation while breath meditation.  Several changes in what and how I notice the breath.  Glimpses of jhanas 3-4.
More drops in fear, anxiety and anger.

Start looking into meditation retreats.  Lots of different books read, all that make me feel more at ease and more as though I’m on the right path.

Anyways hope this is helpful?</div>

Also I just checked the configurator, my one issue with this car is the stupid steering wheel with a fat spoke going right up top, however you can select another more classic design which looks great so problem solved</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There are actually a few different aftermarket steering wheel companies I’ve seen now that look pretty solid. Several guys in the group chat I’m in have purchased and installed them and are happy with them. They’re the shape of the LCI M wheel but with color matched leather to your interior. Carismo is one, I forget the others, but they’re pretty similar. 

Obligatory pic / link to their page (I have no affiliation and haven’t bought one…yet.)

The interior felt better quality than some other recent BMWs too (like the current 5 Series) although I don't like the capacitive touch buttons on the steering wheel.

Really looking forward to seeing what the Neue Klasse 3 Series looks like as I think the design language will work really well in a traditional saloon/sedan shape.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">they stole the election too, with vote switching/adding in votes during the counting process via Starlink.  Elon/Elon's son AND Trump slipped up and admitted it live on TV a few times.  Now, they've bought Dominion voting systems.  

Basically, without cheating/stealing or Russian interference the GOP hasn't won a real election in the presidency since the 1980's outside of Bush Jr.'s 2nd term (he stole the first with Jeb recount). 

Its actually insane how much the GOP is the deep state, hence why they use the term so much (always projection).</div>
