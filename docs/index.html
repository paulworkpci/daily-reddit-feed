My replies are things like "oh I like roller skating and reading!" I don't read very often and I only roller skate like once every three months. However, I also understand that they are kinda asking you "what things do you like, that the other people around probably don't?" I figure that a person would only ask you the original question in order to learn more about you, to distinguish you from others in the future.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I haven’t gotten super far almost a hour in. But I agree so far. First 20 minutes he’s right. And then he completely loses the plot for the next 25. He actually becomes a bit insufferable to listen to because he stops focusing on getting varying degrees of opinions on the show and just starts harping on you Need to be a historian to talk about history etc.. That’s patently false, I probably have done more ww2 research in the last 10 years out of just curiosity but I would never claim to be a historian, and if someone wanted to talk to me about it on a podcast I sure as hell am going to talk about it because I’m interested. 

Rogan has a responsibility to a degree, but not about platforming people. He can do whatever he wants. He just can’t present it as an equal representation. That would be lying. Douglas can call Rogan out on it to do better, but Rogan isn’t required to do anything about it. It’s a disregard for all of our individual agency. If you are too dumb that you consume Rogans show and spout it as fact, that’s on you.</div>

You put in credit after credit asking it to do something, it takes days of clicking accept and reading what it's trying, having to start over and over again, until the RNG gods strike and it finally finds the right approach. A lot of time you still have to tell it very directly what to do. 


Migrating from kickstart graphql to graphql for spring took me 3 days trying to prompt it. I learned nothing in the process (not a java dev). I still had to have someone very familiar with Java review the code. I could have spent the time learning the frameworks and understanding how to migrate it instead, and actually learned something.</div>

That being said, with every new release the level of difficulty of real world tasks that can be reliably completed grows a little bit. 

Firebase can create tiny games one shot, for example. It couldn't complete a TTRPG character creator though, without a significant amount of work and guidance.  By the end of summer though it might be able to one shot it. We'll see.</div>

Looks like they're just (very high quality) prosthetics controlled by the muscles that remain in the stump. They're Bluetooth enabled and the hands can still communicate with the forearm bases when disconnected.

My doctor refused to believe I had it. He said that disease “only affected post-menopausal women.” 

I insisted on the blood test. He had to eat crow when the results came back. Here we are 30 years later and I know several men with the same condition.

I’d really like to know wtf is going on myself</div>

The U.S.-China trade war was NEVER about “fair trade” or “protecting American jobs.” That’s the spoon-fed lie they want you to swallow. The truth? **This is economic decoupling at lightspeed**—a desperate scramble to sever ALL ties with China before the inevitable war erupts.

Think about it: why would the U.S. suddenly slap **145% tariffs** on Chinese goods**, knowing full well it’ll make your iPhone cost $2,500 or your electric vehicle u...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Paul Tudor Jones, who anticipated 1987 Black Monday and profited from it, has recently opened a sizeable position in Intel. It's at rock bottom prices, and if anything happens with Taiwan it will suddenly become the chip monopoly again by default, securing US dominance for Chip Manufacturing again. I follow this space as I'm heavily invested in it, so I think a lot of people are starting to wake up to the opportunity. Never let a good tragedy go to waste.

They selected trump to be the President because no one else can get away with irrational and chaotic decisions like he can.

They needed him to start this trade war and be the scapegoat for what's coming. 

This is a life or death situation for USA. They're trying to salvage the situation and crush China before it's too late.

I do think personally it's too late already and China can beat us in any war short of a nuclear war which is mutual destruction.</div>

New day on Capitol Hill? The Congressional UAP Caucus has been quiet — when not headline grabbing with their separate JFK and Epstein investigations — this entire 119th Congress. Now they say they have a game plan. 

Waiting. Watching. Pressing.

You have a recording of Burlison leaving a scif with burchett and saying, “we found a new form of propulsion,” burchett immediately changed the subject. I wish you could have pushed and asked a follow up. 

Do you know what I’m talking about?

Thanks for doing the work you do.</div>

Do you have a car? Are you open/free for a weekend city trip? Could you drive to Netcong and observe the *daily* UAP activity over there? Ideally, bring a proper thermal camera with you to rule out regular military activity. Netcong is about a 4h44m drive from Capitol Hill. The proper thermal camera gear for definitive evidence is sadly, quite expensive, easily a grand and above to be able to record a proper heat signature.

I was there last month, flew over from the EU to investigate this whole drone story thing, found personal confirmation of these "drones" over at Netcong. (they're nothing like those regular annoying buzzing drones)

But sadly without the proper expensive hardware needed to get definitive proof of their presence there ...

Also, can you ask them about the tridactyls being investigated in Peru? You know, the Nazca "mummies" or they still stuck in the "just a hoax" phase? What about their DICOM files then? How is that explained?

I'm hoping her definition of "fun" is "evidence", "data", "subpoenas" and "testimony".

That being said the fact that Grusch is there makes me hopeful that these politicians might stumble onto something useful.

The technology has improved but the games have not in terms of breadth, depth, and fun. just because a genre has been done, doesn't mean it has been perfected.

Every atrocity is justified because we’re fighting terrorism. It’s the world we live in now.

We’re the good guys. Civilian deaths are just an unfortunate side effect of winning the war on terror. If you kill 1000 of us, we’re justified killing 50,000 of you because our cause is righteous!

Once we’ve killed all the terrorists and defeated extremist ideology, we’ll simply apologize to those who lost their friends, family, neighbors, homes, businesses, hospitals &amp; schools. They’ll forgive us, because it was all justified. 

Then, we’ll all be friends!</div>

For a company like Rockstar it's basically financial suicide to wait another 10+ years to release a game. No doubt within 5 years or less you'll start to see large scale open world games being created with AI.</div>

I had people ask me the following:

When is it?
What day?
What is it for?
Who is it supporting?
Are we all invited?
How much is it? Like, is it a gold coin donation?
Do I need to bring food?
Do I need to pay?
What morning tea?

I swear there were only maybe 3 people who actually read the thing. I had bright yellow and purple posters above our sign in tablet, on the fridge and at eye level on the wall outside every doorway in the common areas and one person didn’t even *see* one of them.</div>

🔹 **Chatgpt** \- great for quick refactors, fixing logic errors, and even rewriting some messy documentation.

🔹 **Perplexity** \-used it for research-heavy tasks: summarizing articles, comparing sources, and checking facts without the rabbit hole.

🔹 **Blackbox AI** \- used it to search through codebases faster, copy code from Yt, and understand old snippets I forgot I wrote.

Mine were:

* ChatGPT for, well, everything to do with homelife or just my brain. And images. 

* Microsoft Copilot for summaries at work (data secure version they pay for) 

* Gemini when Copilot failed me (Copilot's crap) 

* Dola AI for keeping my personal calendar. 

* NotebookLM for a fake podcast, for fun

* Sora for videos, for fun

Fr though, I really get the feeling that years down the line, when AI Gen has likely already become a very normal thing, all the very loud people who had not-so nuanced views against AI will suddenly all be like, “No, I’ve always liked AI!”.

Various Reddit and Twitter spaces in particular are going to be museums for the vitriol we often see against AI right now.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Anti-AI is basically just a Twitter bubble.

Because of my wife, we're friends with a high-profile photographer I won’t name, don’t want the Luddites coming after her, but she says that in her circle, everyone is excited about AI and what it’ll bring to the table. I liked how she put it - paraphrased:

"A new tool always means there’s a new art waiting to be discovered. How can any artist be against that?"

"But what if this new tool can make photos that are way better than yours, on its own?"

"I don’t know any AI model that does anything on its own. They all need human input to create. And what most people probably miss is that it also needs human input for the output. The human decides what happens to this output so that it matches the artist’s vision as closely as possible.

And it doesn’t matter how good AI gets, this human vision is what makes it art. Even if you had a magical machine that could literally create what you have in mind 1:1, there would still be artists. The people who can create astonishing things in their mind’s eye will always stand above those who can’t.

I think the only ones afraid of this are people who know they don’t have any vision. Their technical skill is the only thing keeping them afloat.

Well yeah, for those people it’s going to suck. But I wouldn’t call them artists in the first place."</div>

On a related but very different note, this is why I'm confident machine consciousness is possible. I don't know if or when we'll figure out how to reach it. However, assuming most people and other higher animals are conscious as they appear to be and not just p-zombies, it must be a pretty wide target to hit. These meat computers come together in all sorts of configurations, with all sorts of wildly different training data, all building our own separate models on varying hardware, and yet consciousness still pops out of pretty much all of them. It can't be all that sensitive to specifics. Whenever we figure out the kinds of computations it entails, hardware should be able to run it just as well as wetware.</div>

What helped more was something much simpler:
Doing one focused task at a time.
No multitasking. No pressure to "optimize everything." Just one thing, done with full attention.

I also started asking myself daily:
“What would make today feel like a win?”
That one question brought clarity. And it removed the guilt of not doin...</div>

1.	⁠write everything out as normal
2.	⁠be ruthless in crossing out anything you can get away with not doing
3.	⁠you’re left with the real priorities very quickly, in a small achievable list that is mindful of the other things occupying space in your brain.

After a while you’ll realise that not much happens on the things you’ve dropped and you are just naturally drawn to the most impactful tasks.</div>

So instead of just mindlessly being on my phone as a break, I actively decide to read for a half hour.

It makes me more focused overall as I do things that better refresh me and I don’t have the same guilt.
