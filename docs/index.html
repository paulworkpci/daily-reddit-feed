                <div class="post-content">Hey all,

As a spur of the moment thing I booked and paid for a foundation course at my local CrossFit gym (£200 GBP). I’ve recently been through a tough breakup and my mental health has been pretty poor since, so I thought exercising in a community setting may help. 

Unfortunately I had a huge wave of social anxiety the hour before my booked session and I cancelled online and didn’t go. 

I’ve now lost the credit, so I’ve got 3 out of 4 sessions left meaning I won’t be able to complete the ful...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Honestly, there's no work out harder than getting out of your own head. I know how you feel, I was actually sick the morning I attended my first CF class because I was so nervous. You just need to battle through that anxiety and turn up. It will be one of the best things you'll ever do and in a few months you'll reflect on how far you've come and be so proud of yourself. 

I've been doing CF for 4 years (I'm injured at the moment though). I've met some of the nicest people. I joined a running club and ran a half marathon last year. The community in CF is very supportive and no one will ever look down on you for being unfit. 

You can do this!! I believe in you ❤️</div>

I’ve never been athletic. I have about 10kg to lose and I’m doing hard cardio a few times a week. I just want to exist more in the fitness space but I’m so terrified, I’m scared to even go for a run outdoors 🙄🙄</div>

Plus, you’re 6 feet and 84 kg???? How’s that overweight??? I’m 5.83 and was 130 kg at my heaviest, and nobody batted an eye at me when I joined my gym. If anything, they’ve been the most supportive bunch cause they’ve seen me going from barely jumping to now doing my first pull ups.

Just go, you’ll have fun!</div>

And regarding my weight, I started at 107kg so I sorta know how you feel! I’m still considered overweight by BMI (eye roll) and I guess I’m more worried about my general lack of fitness than my body weight.</div>

You still have to be able to assert  you're not going to tolerate this. 


You're going about it a different way by giving the person an out. 


But that is still what is happening. You  have to be firm and aggressive in your response.

I won’t lie, Dems suck, but not for the reasons Joe uses to justify himself and who he supports. 

And this won’t be an issue for the new sober Christian Joe Rogan. He’s going to say “maybe it’s not such a bad idea, maybe these things, drugs and alcohol aren’t conducive to a constructive society”.</div>

A ship is structurally more complex and must use most of its resources to keep the humans on board alive on a millennia-long journey. An uncrewed probe, on the other hand, doesn't need space or mass for air, water, food, recycling systems, temperature control, waste management, etc. This frees up an enormous amount of mass and volume for scientific instruments or computronium (or whatever computational substrate AIs might use).


Transporting the human genome is also much easier than transporting humans, so interstellar colonization via Von Neumann probes seems more feasible and cheaper to me than generational ships.</div>

A fleet of Starships with enough mining and refining equipment to bootstrap an economy from scratch is, technically speaking, self replicating.

                        <div class="comment-body">I've been saying this since RAG first became the term used to describe the method. And you are exactly right, the whole reason it became a thing was because, back when context windows were 4k or 8k max, it was out of necessity. Now, in the age where context windows are 1M or 10M tokens, it only makes sense in specific enterprise cases where you have vast datasets to query for specific, isolated information.

Using embeddings and vector DBs for coding with codebases that can fit into context is a huge mistake, and it's mainly done by companies to save money for greater profits (like Cursor) at the cost of performance. Roo or Cline don't do it because it hurts performance, and it's your own dime.

I cringe when I see projects come up that brag about turning small personal codebases into "1500 layer vectorized embeddings to intelligently access the code that matters." To the uninformed, it sounds sophisticated and "better".

No, you are just needlessly adding a layer of complexity that tremendously hurts performance, adds points of failure, and gives incredibly unreliable or inconsistent results.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">RAG isn’t just calling vector stores, it’s also prompt priming before generation using various sources. Dynamically priming the prompt with relevant information before the LLM generates a response.

A lot of the large context models drop off in accuracy after 100k tokens, anyway.

                                <div class="reply-body">AHH yeah you say that. But I've been messing around with different models for a while.

I used roo code with sonnet 4 today to do a large refactor on an app. 

Architect mode, to orchestrator, boomerang tasks etc. roo code blew 60 dollars and eventually I pulled the plug and started over. 

I did it again with built in cursor models swapping, I did improve the initial prompt to specifically address the issues we had on the first attempt. With a little more hand holding I got it done in cursors for less than 5 dollars of credits. 

One thing it does prove is that the quality of your prompt is still king. It's a tool to be guided nit does not replace engineers.</div>

Grandma and Grandpa that you need to help press the green button to answer a call? These are the people who are drafting thousands of pages of legislation covering telecommunications, compute, and AI.

They are so outrageously in over their heads they don't even know how to ask the questions they would need to understand the basic terminology, in order to have the conversations they would need, to begin to grasp the issues they are literally passing laws about.

The Control Problem? AI alignment? They don't even know what these words mean much less have an informed opinion about the issue or a solution for any problem in any context.

They just do what their corporate sponsors tell them to do and collect their bribes. That's it. "Vote yes." And they just do it without even understanding what they are voting on.</div>

These aren’t boomers, these are Gen Xers who grew up with computers. And of course, much of the policy work is done by 20 and 30 somethings who certainly aren’t old. 

Yes, maybe it’s possible that the entire US government is just too dumb to grasp what random Redditors have grasped, or maybe AI people don’t have arguments that are convincing enough. No one is obligated to agree with you.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">No. Thinktanks, lobbyists, legislative staff, and congressional staff (apolitical, literally to serve the congressional body) draft and write legislation.

Just as no single person could have insight over every facet of every discipline in 1950, they can't now.

The system is built to allow for representatives to perhaps habe domains of interest, but to be able to rely on industry experts and constituency groups to draft relevant and impactful legislation.

The problem right now is two-fold - one is that the party in control has absolutely no interest in regulating a technology owned by their donors, and the other is that even if there was motivation to do so, it isn't entirely xlear what the end game is or how anything could even be enforced.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The goalpost at Anthropic seems to have shifted from solving AGI to solving SWE. An AI model that is able to write the majority of software to build a new software product, including itself, is still nowhere close to AGI. You could even argue that they're already there. That's how near meaningless it is.

And it's important to note that his last remark

&gt;so we can go home and knit sweaters.

in the context of his prior statement is referring to owners of Anthropic stock that are able to go home and knit sweaters. Not anyone else. Not related to UBI. Not related to AGI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is false. Anthropic has as a target goal to close the recursive loop. As someone that actually works in the industry it's bizarre how big of a disconnect there is between what people outside of the industry seem to know and predict and what people outside of the industry seem to think.

To give you some indication, most colleagues of mine think we will have closed the loop and be replaced in just 2-3 years from now. You have no idea how far along we are and how much is already delegated to AI systems. Every couple of weeks we make a breakthrough and delegate yet another piece of the process. This not only makes us more productive and faster to iterate but it also is the clear endgoal.

Once the loop is closed we will beeline straight to ASI, potentially the phase where we are at AGI will only last a very short time, probably without public release.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">As someone trying to lower the anxiety of a lot of people around me just hopping on the train I've been riding for a while:

It's not going to be just your job. It's not going to be just any job. Artists, translators, copywriters...

Everyone is going to be impacted for two simple reasons: if only a significant enough portion of jobs are completely replaced, then high enough unemployment is sufficient to impact the economy to affect everyone.

The alternative is that most jobs are replaced, in which case everyone is also affected but even more so: if you can't pay your mortgage, you have a problem with the bank, but if nobody can pay their mortgages, then the it is the bank who has a problem with everyone.

The third "option", for those who choose to believe, is that it's not a major change at all and only some jobs are going to be affected minimally. In which case you get yourself together and move on. Why believe this ongoing shitshow slowly descending into hell is better than significant change, I can't really understand but that is what some people want...

If you are, or have been, smart enough to keep yourself afloat so far, you're likely to figure it out in a new world order as well. If you haven't, then what's another fart to someone who's already shit themselves? If you're doing very well though, you are the one with most to lose. Those people are mostly not worried either due to ignorance or hubris though.

The day where AI can do all or most of your jobs, it will also be capable of doing a ton of others jobs.</div>

If you dont know what a Supra is, and see it on the road, you're most likely asking questions about what it is. If you are an enthusiast, you've probably at some point mentioned the Supra in conversation. Either way, "Toyota" is being brought up. This kind of conversation would be great for both Nissan and Acura.</div>

Waiting for people just to see them come late to a place where it was them who needee help. No thank you gesture or being understandable that the said person has really come out of his comfort zone to help. 

I started saying No more often. People who aren't my real friends, moved away and I loved that.</div>

For starters, a bee flies way faster and jerky. Your head would spin trying to watch that.

In addition, only the hind legs dangle down during flight. The other legs are retracted.</div>

I view this as another grand theatrical performance by the uniparty.  Until they provide the list of companies that received the loans, and what the loans were intended for, along with the names of the people that approved the loans, this is just more rage bait.

                        <div class="comment-body">This is why I continually say "vibe coding will steal jobs" is wrong.  If a dev just vibes in a lot of features, they end up with exactly what you described; a pile of slop features of which they have no idea how any work under the hood, or even where to quickly start debugging.

Making a plan is ESSENTIAL and I spend most of my time planning - both creating and refactoring plans - until I feel that it's following the architecture I want &amp; understand, each phase of the plan ends with something testable, and each step of every phase is small enough for me to review all the code after the LLM writes it.  All that goes in markdown files in a /plan directory in the repo.  I then have the planning LLM write me the prompt to use for the coding LLM that includes everything the coding LLM needs to know to understand what the project is, what the major phases are, what tools to use, what the tech choices were, and where the planning docs are.  Finally, I put that prompt into the coding LLM and ask it to ask me any clarifying questions.

As an example, I did this last night with a React Native app I've wanted to make for a while - it was 30 minutes of back and forth with the planning LLM (Claude Desktop using 4.0), then 5 minutes with the coding LLM (Zed's Claude 4.0 credits) answering questions, then I unleashed the coding LLM on the first phase.  20 minutes and 4 phases later I had my fully functional app - and most importantly - I knew exactly how everything worked.</div>

I mean if I have to spend hours planning and refactoring plans, I’d honestly rather write the app myself.

It’s much easier for me to store the plan in my head and pump out code versus spending hours managing a complex knowledge system hoping the AI gets it, while simultaneously hoping to not oversaturate the context window. 

Like where’s the AI advantage here exactly?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Mental illness often happens when you try to push down your emotions. You beat yourself up when you feel social anxiety, so in the future you become more anxious about social anxiety, hence making your social anxiety worse. I was stuck in this feedback loop for over a decade.

Meditation helps me catch myself when I’m trying to avoid my anxiety.

Instead of thinking “ohhh no I’m anxious right now! This is the worst time to be anxious because this girl is so beautiful!” I now think “it’s okay that I’m anxious”

Instead of thinking “oh no I screwed it up because I was anxious” I think “it’s okay that I screwed it up”

When you’re feeling those emotions, meditate on them and experience them fully. You’ll notice that they’ll eventually pass, making the next time a little easier.</div>

Apply the awareness and mindfulness you develop thru meditation

The space you create from your awareness and thoughts is crucial to understand, feel and express your emotions and feelings in a healthier way

One thing I learned, its also the same for positive emotions. Be sure to apply the same awareness when your body and mind is trying to feel them as well especially in expressing love, gratitude, appreciation and peace.

                        <div class="comment-body">It has actually. Through meditation it becomes clearer that most of our anxiety is caused by being lost in the past or future, in planning and remembering. Meditation helps to clear our mind, so we can catch ourselves when we are off lost in a stressful thought. When we are more present in the moment, we aren't worrying about what we should say or do next, or what people will think about us, so we become a lot more confident in every situation.

For example, I used to be quite shy and awkward, and I would get anxious easily. After I started meditating, I just felt a lot more free, social situations felt easier and more spontaneous, and a natural sense of happiness and clarity started to grow.

The ability to slow down and be present naturally makes us happier because all those worries and regrets about past and future have started to quiet down. This happens naturally when we stop following our every thought.

So through the process of meditation, we become less anxious, more confident and happier. These are all benefits, however they are not the point of meditation. The point of meditation is to begin to know ourselves more, and in that silence comes a wisdom that will be a wonderful gift in our lives.</div>
