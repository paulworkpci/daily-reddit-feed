I don't think people are going to want to watch most of this. it drives the value of media production to near zero, but you have to think about how the demand side will be changed as well, or how it will not have changed, and will still not be entertained by slop. we like actors, for one thing.</div>

We've already had manufactured videos that look indistinguishable from reality on the internet for 10+ years now and we've done a decent job at using context to know the difference. 

It's the sheer number of these that can be made now, along with people purposefully misusing it for political reasons that we need to worry about - not how realistic it looks.</div>

Quick heads-up: This post was AI-translated, as I figured it would help get the tone right for an English-speaking audience.

Ever since Claude 4 was released, I've been seriously considering subscribing (thinking of the Max tier). I really want to dive deep into using Claude for coding and see if it can genuinely help with my personal projects.

A few months back, I used Cursor quite a bit. Honestly, it ended up wasting some of my time. For certain problems, it just couldn't get it...</div>

Also, with things changing on what feels like a daily basis, the best one can do is to try out new things all the time.

For me the sweet spot is using cursor, where I have access to all models for a low flat fee, plus kilocode within cursor for more flexibility and, even more importantly, more reliability for larger context prompts.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I don't think Claude Code is *significantly* better than Cursor or Windsurf. If you tried Cursor before and it wasn't up to the task, I would say don't bother spending 100s of dollars on Claude Code; all of this is based on the same tech at the end of the day, so the differences are never going to be dramatic.

From my experience, AI in general is still a bit immature when it comes to dealing with large established codebases; we are not quite there yet when it comes to tasks like refactoring or accurately documenting large codebases yet, so your prior experience is not surprising.

My recommendation: keep experimenting with Cursor or Windsurf and rather than expecting magic out of them or nothing, figure out by trial and error the kinds of tasks where they are good at in the context of your project and take it from there.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think this is because for someone like Joe, a very wealthy individual who really gets to do everything he's ever wanted and life is basically something we can't even imagine really, I think for Joe and those types of people, they really... really wouldn't mind if the party kept going. They don't want it to end. I think Joe is just reaching an age where he's realizing this won't go on forever... but if it did, that'd be amazing. A lot of people become a little more religious or at least open to the possibility later in life and this doesn't surprise me really.

One thing's for sure though, dude has almost done a complete 180 from who he was just 5 years ago. Kinda wild to watch in real time because I've heard him talk more than any family member in my life lol, multiple times a week</div>

The issue is for anyone looking to buy a cheap used car in the next few years is the two of the biggest supply disruptions in the last 40 years happened \~11 years apart reducing a lot of car supply.  The last time car sales fell as low as the Great Recession/Covid was 1981.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1Jivr](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1Jivr)

The US was buying \~17M/cars a year at the end of 2006.  From 2007- 2014, something like 30M new cars were not sold b/c of the Great Recession. Then Covid caused a 2nd gigantic dip of 2021-2024 cars not being produced.  There are also now \~40M more people in the US than in 2007.</div>

"Aftermarket Positioned for Growth

For the aftermarket sector, the aging US vehicle fleet represents a substantial opportunity. As vehicles reach the six- to 14-year window, they require more frequent maintenance, repairs and parts replacements. With the 2015-2019 model years now entering this prime age range, a wave of service demand is expected to hit repair shops, part suppliers and service providers across the country.

New and used vehicle prices remain high, further encouraging vehicle owners to keep their cars longer and invest in upkeep rather than replacement. This will lead to significant opportunities for maintenance and repair as vehicles roll of warranty. "

Well, yeah. Guessing they are priming auto shops, repair shops, warranty specialist, etc, for the influx of used cars needing...well, repairs.</div>

People are definitely holding on to their cars longer and fixin 'em up. 

I \*think\* they get bored with their cars, go check out cars at dealerships, realize cars are ridiculously expensive and decide to keep their existing vehicle. So they start to pay attention to the stuff that's broken or is in rough shape. 

Additionally, since they're going to keep a car they're bored of, they do things to fall in love with it again. Window tint. New stereo. Fresh detail. Etc.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The problem with some (probably most) AI skeptics is that they're incredibly short-sighted. They tend to make predictions and draw conclusions based solely on the current state of technology, completely ignoring how quickly paradigms are shifting, which is often faster than anyone expects. It's almost comical: a skeptic will confidently declare that a particular breakthrough is "decades away" or that a certain benchmark will take forever to be beaten, and then, just months later, that very benchmark is shattered by a new breakthrough. Some also assume that LLMs are pretty much all there ever will be in the AI industry, which is nonsensical and abrsurd. The more advanced technology gets, the harder it is to be so certain about its future. That's why I dislike both pure optimists and pessimists alike - too much certainty.</div>

Realistically, we only shortened it by about 80~ thousand PHD years in discovering 200 million protein structures. Since, it took 6 decades for us to initially discover 150 thousand protein structures. But that assumes technology doesn’t evolve during that 80 thousand years.</div>

And then there are these two papers, which are quite easy to reproduce yourself, or turn into experiments with students or clients. Especially if you have people in the group who have a wrong idea of what LLMs actually are.
I always start with: "So if I train an LLM on chess games, what will happen?"
Most say: "It'll suck at chess, because predicting moves like text tokens produces broken chess" or "It'll never be able to finish a complete game since you can't train it on every possible position" or something along those lines.
But so far, nobody has gotten it right.

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11741v1

When trained on chess games, an LLM starts playing better chess than the games it was trained on.
That an LLM can play chess at all is a very underappreciated ability, because it's the simplest counter-argument against people who say "IT CaN oNly ReProDUCe TraingData! JusT adVancEd AutoCoMPLetE".
Every chess game reaches a novel position quite fast, and even in those novel positions, the LLM still plays chess pretty damn well. So autocomplete my ass.

Further with chess you can actually prove that a LLM builds indeed internal world models instead of just relying on statistics

An LLM is aware of its own capabilities. If you fine-tune it with bad code full of errors and security holes, the LLM will realize something is wrong with it.</div>

They lost Ukraine two decades ago through influence. If we push them out of a sovereign nation all they're going to do is string their leader up and sulk. 

The world will never allow Russia to push that button. And their own people would probably stop it too.</div>

He has never wavered from that and most in this sub understand that the establishment, like in WW1 and WW2, will deliberately cull mankind. Putin is as much a part of the establishment as Trump, Starmer &amp; Macron et al. 

It's been their globalist plan all along, a very controlled nuclear strike on every major city in the world, bit by bit, and those who dodge the nukes will be sent to the Middle East for the finale.

The basic principles that a lot of our human life/"world" is built upon, are simple, but obscured in a ton of noise that we have troubles/no real incentive/no time/learning bandwidth to try to sort through.


They started from force-feeding models large part of internet, to repeat without thinking at all. Then began to give them a little bit of time to think in math/programming/some of the physics and slight tiny experiments in other "domains". Just a tiny bit, with very limited freedom and ability to go outside of current task at hand.
The developers have no "trust" in those models yet, and didn't prepare better and more, varied, training environments and goals.


When less fear, more trust and preparation, will be there, the models will begin to learn about our life and "world" better than all of us.


Of course, enough computing power and good enough architectures with lots of flexible/parallel/less constrained by just language thinking, must be there too.</div>

Edit- I see you said copilot is out of the question, but mentioning it because you didn’t specifically say agent mode. The ask mode isn’t all that helpful but agent mode is a game changer comparatively.</div>

I went to the ER because the veins in my hands were bulging, I was having palpitations, and my blood pressure was 180. 

ER dr asked me if I ever had dreams. I said yes. He then stated my dreams were causing this.

And yes, I am a woman.</div>

‘ICE’ = the patient’s ideas, concerns &amp; expectations

What do you think is going on here?
What’s your biggest concern?
What were you hoping for from this consultation today?

People’s answers will vary wildly. Sometimes they think you’re stupid… “I don’t know doc, that’s what I’m here to see you for?!” … but particularly in the age of the internet, most people have at least one of ‘ICE’ to share.</div>

Not entirely the same as your comment, but it reminded me that sometimes her job "getting people back up and running" is helping them deal with the mental roadblocks keeping them down. (My wife is a wonderful human being)</div>

These image generators are already pretty good in the sense of being capable of generating high-quality images, sometimes on par with good human artists if you're willing to be patient with them.

                        <div class="comment-body">It’s good but there are still some odd things going on and we’ve had some good options for a while. My attempt at nitpicking:

* The first one looks good but there’s a pretty big margin when it’s that stylised. Some of the trees look a bit odd. 

* Second picture has a floating dumpling at the end of the chopsticks, various shadows that aren’t right (eg the chopstick pot seems to have a hand shadow), weird reflections on the window, chair the woman is sitting on is missing a horizontal brace, woman at the back right has incoherent clothing.

* Third one looks like a weird cross between a flamingo and a scarlett ibis . Droplets on the beak don’t make much sense in size and the shape with which they fan out.

* The stamp seems to have a tree floating behind the palm tree in a space where there isn’t really room for it. The van appears to be driven by a dementor and the writing on the side lacks coherence. The $1.50 on the awning is pretty out of place - a stamp price being integrated in an odd way?</div>

I then read about vagus nerve stimulation and started humming around two weeks ago and now my anxiety is at an all time low.

Looks like you’re enjoying Brahmarie Pranayama. 

Look into a few more pranayama techniques, like Kapalbhati, and Nadi Shodhana pranayama. 

These are all great techniques to use prior to Dhyana. It helps to calm the mind.  

Throw in a few customized Asanas, and don’t forget the Mudras.

It honestly amazes me people this willfully ignorant vote. Like you have to try hard to be this blissfully unaware of the mountains of data we have on the efficiency of the vaccine and safety.

You should be speaking at critical care and pulmonologist conventions somehow we are all mistaken on the scientific consensus and evidence based care physicians have found.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Look at what all of these people have in common

- RFK Jr - father was killed when he was a teen (which is abandonment, unintentional or not)

- Joe Rogan - father beat up his mother when he was 6, divorced

- Dana White - father &amp; mother were substance abusers

- Elon Musk - father was an abusive alcoholic

- Aaron Rodgers - completely broken relationship with his family

Common denominator - people with money &amp; success who were all "betrayed" in one way or another by the primary authority figures (i.e. their fathers) in childhood.

Because their primary authority figure in childhood failed them, they resist ANY authority figure telling them that they HAVE to do something.  

The automatic response is NO instead of yes - because they feel they CANNOT trust any authority figure with their safety, health &amp; wellbeing.

The sins from childhood are coming back to roost in successful people (who have an amplified voice only because of their success).

That's the ultimate reality of what went on here.  People's reactions were a mere side effect of bad parenting in our country...something that is unfortunately only getting worse &amp; worse with each generation.</div>

This is also the position of the UK, Sweden, Germany, and a majority of Europe.
