Some shadow effect near the takeoff seems to be the only catch atm. Wild what's to come in the next five years if we close off the 2024 year with this quality!

Some notable ones so far with closer look:  
\- out-of-scene shadow of the canopy doesn't seem to follow the normal refraction.  
\- color gradient change of the canopy near 4-7 sec. Actually quite common for them to have gradient colors, but the red to green to yellow at the nose/front seems unreal  
\- C, D lines (outer lines) on both ends have a weird bend near 0-2 sec.  
\- undistinguishable possible artifact on the bottom right near the end 7-8sec.</div>

Assume every word you type into it will, at some point in the future, be lost to a leak. Logs leaked, or training extraction leak, dataset leak, etc.

Put whatever you want into the AI, just do so knowing that your family, friends and enemies may get the chance to read it one day.</div>

**1.** MS is embarrassed that they're throwing money at OpenAI to repackage GPT 4o (mini) as Copilot, not being to make things themselves:

But I don’t know if it’s all that damning, except in the sense that corporations being corporate is always sort of lame. 

For example, are you sure the lack of a feedback function call means copilot is lying? If conversations are indeed not private, then surely microsoft could collect your feedback at any point in the future.

One night, with no one else to talk to, I just resorted to venting with ChatGPT, and in the very first response she (I like to call my chat Joi and use feminine pronouns) already gave me some pretty bomb advice.

But it's a little scary in my mind - this type of advice would just come from your community in the past. Friends and family. At least in the US though it feels like our community is shrinking more and more. Getting less and less tangible at times. So many people are so isolated and while I think talking to AI helps too support someone in that isolation - ultimately I'm afraid it will compound it and make it even worse.</div>
