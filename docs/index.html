                                <div class="reply-body">This is a myth that $x group has some magical data. And people also greatly misunderstand synthetic data. Everyone is training on pretty much the same data, nearly the entire corpus of the internet. What people mean when they say "quality of data" is just the ability to curate what parts of their dataset are "higher quality" (papers, textbooks, etc) and what's not high quality, and then weighting them correctly. High quality data just means data that's known to be correct and when say a human studies from the data, they will actually learn something correct as opposed to a toddler learning English from just someone that mashed some words together. It's really just a labor intensive process to weed and classify this kind of data, there isn't any magic on it. And accordingly "synthetic data" is 90% of the time BS. And it's nonsensical to use your own models to generate synthetic data. Imagine someone learning English by looking at their own past writing, it doesn't make sense--you're not really improving from it.

More data is really only helpful if it's actually \*novel\* data that's not been seen before substantially on the internet. And people joke about social media platforms, because of dumb comments, broken English and this and that, but actually, that has very little impact... as long as it's coherent (written by a human and can be understood by others), there was some brain work put into constructing those words. And you can still use it as useful training data to reconstruct the neural processes that led to writing those words. And this goes beyond text too, to images and video.</div>

Disclaimer, this is my personal conspiratorial take: 

I think between tesla, whatever hes doing with ai chatbots, and spacex, there is enough demand for compute that the gpus won't sit idle.  I don't think anyone including musk expects grok/xai to be a serious player in the industry but that doesn't matter, he comingles assets and that fact alone makes the TN data center attractive.

Xai/the data center is legally and financially isolated from the groups that have constructive uses for it, so its not on Tesla's books, for example.  He got investors and loans and such for xai because of course he's not putting his own money up.  The whole thing is a massive resource to his two profitable companies, obtained with minimal personal risk.  He just needs to do enough AI stuff to string along the people loaning money.  The rest of the compute goes to spacex/tesla which will serve as a competitive advantage, which indirectly and eventually gives a return in the form of stock/share prices.

I think Musk does have a legitimate interest in AI but he has just as much if not more interest in personally profiting from the *money* being thrown at AI.  Maybe this is obvious, but I think that's how the TN data center fits in, anyway.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">However, heating the food multiple times can also work better than one long session. As most microwave carousels will alternate the direction of spin every time you start them.

I wonder which method would work better for heating food. Baby sitting multiple heating processes (including time to manually mix up the food for even heating) or one long session at a lower temperature.

I suppose it depends on how much time a person is willing to invest versus the ease of using one session. Seems like "MythBusters" or "YouTube" territory.</div>

Accepting censorship or oppression from a faction rivaling the other faction you dont like for the sake of being contrarian will only hurts you!

I saw screenshot from other sub about gemini? chatgpt? being "yes israel deserve to be free!" while goes "i have no opinion about palestine." so yes western product also can have bias or propaganda, but doesnt mean other countries' doing it is all okay as well.

Was taking out the trash and looked up and noticed something bright orange headed over head through the pines still scratching our heads on what we saw.

I can sort of tell by the fact there's a telltale green flashing light that comes in around the 19 second mark.

                                <div class="reply-body">I've been thinking about the deep state's potential involvement in US politics, particularly in relation to 9/11 and the subsequent political landscape. My hypothesis is that if the deep state exists, they would infiltrate and manipulate any party to achieve their goals.

I believe this happened post-Bush, with the deep state pivoting to the Democrats under Obama. During his administration, we saw:

* The Patriot Act doubled down on surveillance
* Prosecution of whistleblowers like Edward Snowden, ThinThread NSA whistleblowers
* Radicalization of big tech companies through initiatives like ShareBlue (as seen in Correct The Record's 2015/2016 payrolls)


The deep state likely promised the Democrats unparalleled power and censorship in exchange for their cooperation. This would have been maintained through a potential Kamala Harris presidency, ensuring institutional control.

Some corroborating evidence includes:

* The overwhelming opposition to Trump from the RNC and media in 2015 (before the left-wing backlash)
* The Democratic Party's shift towards pro-war and pro-Big Pharma positions (e.g., Moderna, JJ, Pfizer)
* The CTR payrolls and ShareBlue meetings with big tech companies (including Reddit) in 2015 and 2016
* Notably, anti-deep state politicians like Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul were effectively squeezed out in 2016 and 2012, respectively. I think this narrative helps explain the complex web of events and alliances in US politics.

I was astounded that there was no revolt over 9/11. I realized young that we were too complacent and will do nothing. All I can do now is hope that I'm never in the wrong place at the wrong time.


Edit: my older brother had a lot with informing me about all this. That's likely why I believed in the conspiracy and was privy to the info.</div>

It ruins the Internet experience. Yet, people just accept this as normal.

Wanna play a game? Okay, enjoy endless ads and money grubbing opportunities unless you pay $6/month.

Wanna edit photos? Same thing.

Browsing the web: "We noticed you have an ad blocker, please disable it to continue." "Wanna read the rest of the article? Please pay us $5."

They're all starting to run out of money.  Even the news agencies went out of business over a decade ago and only exist as PR fronts.

                        <div class="comment-body">While I actually understand your frustration, I actually think it’s worth framing the cost issue differently.

If a service asks you to pay, but in exchange doesn’t collect your data, give you ads, and do other shitty practices, I actually think that’s fabulous.

The Owellian nightmare we’re in largely results from a business model where individuals expect to get services for free without paying for anything.

Nothing is free. If it looks free, you’re paying, bit probably in a nefarious, worse way.

 Reforming the internet can only come from internalizing the costs we have thhsfar externalized.

That all being said, I’m not aware of many services that legitimately behave ethically in this way. Amazon, Netflix et al all double dip, charging you and then stealing your data to boot.</div>

He says it's from his friends who went out by the bay on Dec 22. He seemingly had no interest or posts about UFOs until the drone situation started. The video was also [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1hlhl4o/122224_nj_apparent_instant_acceleration/) a few days ago.

The slowdown edit is appreciated too. I personally think with a light that bright you could see even a faint outline if an object was still there. But there isn't anything whatsoever. The light disappears instantly and there is nothing to show anything was even there in the first place. Also note; it has been reported on numerous times that these things evaded capture or "disappeared" and if what happened here is what we think it is, there ya go.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Why do you assume the second light is the same drone?

Looks like multiple drones turning their lights of an off in a coordinated manner.

This is basic tech for these drones for light shows, etc.</div>

If it had (1) typically human flaws or (2) no visible flaws, it would be perfectly acceptable, no? 

Or what you mean, beyond the fact that it was shitty, is that for the purpose of this festival, it SHOULD NEVER have an AI generated logo?</div>

I got scared for a moment thinking I got banned for adding too much gore, violence and some shit in a scenario of some of my linked stories.

It also has an infinite usage for reasoning,  similar to o1 and it is called deepthink.
It can also search the web.

It tops Meta, Groq, Mistral and Qwen. And it classifies as the top 3 right after Chatgpt and Gemini</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">various algorithms and even human moderators push forward content of more successful and beautiful people. the social media owners don't want their platforms to look like they're full of downtrodden people. they want you to think if you are on this platform then you are a cool successful person and part of the group of good people.

content creators in general will do lots of stuff like take a day trip to a location, film a bunch of content there, and not even pay for a hotel overnight. or that famous rentable 'private jet' seat you could pay to take your photos in. it's a sort of 'fake it til you make it' mindset where they think once they get enough followers and sponsorships then it will become real.

it's true though that a great deal of what you see is amplified in some way, whether that be people choosing to share the most impressive moments and aspects of their life instead of their worst, to actual intentional fakery. it is pretty hard to avoid these days. even before the internet things like magazine shoots would be carefully photoshopped by experts to do what beauty filters do these days.</div>

the more i delay , the more anxious i feel. sometimes i feel a bout of energy surge and i accomplish something, but most of the time i'm just delaying the uncomfortable emotions and fear of failure.

i don't think i'm lazy, i'm passive aggressively suffering. it's like being slow burned to death.

i'm feeling so stressful now, i fear a headache is looming soon.

however, i can't seem to get out of the loo...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">i completely get where you're coming from. procrastination feels like this vicious cycle. you're anxious, so you put things off, and putting them off makes the anxiety even worse. it’s not laziness; it’s more like a mental gridlock where everything feels too overwhelming to start. i procrastinate a lot too, and it’s usually because i feel this pressure to do things perfectly or the fear that even if i try, it won’t be good enough.

sometimes what helps me is breaking tasks into really small pieces, like telling myself, "i'll just open the document and sit with it for five minutes." it sounds ridiculous, but that small start can sometimes lead to real progress.

it’s okay to feel that stress. it’s your mind telling you it needs some kindness. maybe pick one tiny thing to do, even if it feels insignificant. even the smallest step is a win.</div>

GLP-1 agonists are essentially curing obesity globally, but only those incapable of critical thinking would call Novo Nordisk evil for trying to recoup their investment and make enough money to invest in even more medicines. There are hundreds of more examples like this including many that directly enable the comfortable life *you* live today.

Few enough entities invent new things as-is -- I think it's ridiculous to start demonizing those of them inventing new technologies with the hopes to make money. We'd be stuck in the Middle Ages with that mentality, dying in the streets from dysentery at the age of 5, because god forbid we incentivize improvements!</div>

I'd like to see them work 12 months in a corporate job to prove their methods work.

I get contacted by probably 10 a week, targeting 'female executives', and they're 25 years old, haven't accomplished anything related to what they'd advise, and have no experience in my industry. And they're all being taught how to do that by their own predatory "coaches". 

  
I agree that Cal Newport is good. Can anyone else recommend anyone?

For mom types, I do like Lazy Genius and Clutter Bug. And frankly just watching cleaning or "sunday reset" videos on tiktok or youtube. There are some "work inspo" type of creators who do the same thing. If i'm not feeling productive, seeing them do things (and now even just hearing the music that is typically used in those types of videos) is enough to kick me into action.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I know what you mean. I got a bit sick of productivity videos made by people whose main (only?) professional activity is being a productivity influencer. They don't seem to have any other experience to draw on Watching a video about how someone plans their YouTube content  doesn't exactly inspire confidence.

Cal Newport is okay, although I don't think all of his tips are realistic when you're not a celebrity productivity guru. He's changed his tune a bit recently and acknowledges that his work/personal situation isn't necessarily the norm. He sometimes cover questions relevant to academia (my field of work) in his podcast. I do sometimes listen to it but I don't find the content relevant enough to spend too much time on it. The GTD podcast has interesting episodes, which are more focused than Newport.</div>

Like if you put him in a government agency for a year he wouldn’t succeed because he’d lack the autonomy he has always enjoyed in academia. But at least he’s transparent about that. 

Some of these other people seem more focused on decorating their rooms with neon and plants than testing their skills in a real job.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">To play opposite advocate here, the caveat here is that being a content creator (of any type, not just in productivity) IS a full time job. 

It's not traditional in the sense of 9-5, employed by someone else type of work, but being on YouTube or Instagram means managing brand deals, marketing, filming, video editing, uploading (some content creators have strict upload schedules), social media engagement, managing outsourcing of any tasks, and any additional streams of revenue they might have (Twitch, Patreon, Classes, etc). 

Which as you can see, takes time and effort, in which they have to manage and be productive in order for them to succeed. It's not unsurprising that they use those methods and apply it to their own work, which is to create productivity content.

You don't have to be a parent or someone  working a 9-5 in order to talk about productivity methods. It's like saying a primary care doctor would struggle being in an emergency med environment, or a full-time Uber driver struggling to manage time in an office environment. It's just different priorities and restructuring of time, which takes time.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My issue is not so much with the work involved in creating online content, but the quality of some of the content. Even if they use productivity methods to plan their work more efficiently, that doesn't necessarily mean that they have something meaningful to say to others. It might be useful for (wannabe) content creators but it's not automatically relevant for other contexts (I know that makes it sound like a bit of a pyramid scheme, particularly if they start selling templates or courses). 

Maybe there are exceptions but I haven't come across them myself. Examples welcome!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You can still get good videos and advice out of these content creators, but their worth is clearly devalued when they are doing the same thing as most other productivity content creators. You can get a wider and richer range of advice from the minority of creators who have or at least have had other careers, even if they themselves are self-employed (e.g. musicians, writers (not about productivity itself)).

I'd rather watch five people from different careers than five people who are only experienced in productivity-focused content creation itself.</div>
