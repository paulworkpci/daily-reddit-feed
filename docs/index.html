                                <div class="reply-body">I have more in-depth replies elsewhere, but the[ lead author did clarify](https://x.com/AdamZweiger/status/1933544718559764523) on that same thread that their paper is not very indicative of RSI.

&gt;**A few additional notes/limitations about SEAL after seeing some reactions:**  
**- This is \*\*not\*\* AGI / recursive self-improvement. It's more towards LLMs ingesting data in a more effective way. We will need more breakthroughs to overcome the core challenges of generalization, hallucination, and continual learning**  
**- We chose the relatively simply no-context SQuAD setup (short passage and questions) so our base model (Qwen2.5-7B) could fully "understand" the content when it was in-context and respond with a large amount of text compared to the original passage. It would be very cool to see how SEAL scales with model size and task complexity.**  
**- Many people are finding our idea of putting self-editing in an RL loop extremely compelling (and we agree!). As a bit of a warning though, RL is not a magic wand that pushes the reward to 1 in any environment. Weight updates from minimal data can be quite brittle and hard to work with, and it's possible self-edits of the form we study are upper bounded in ability to effectively update the model.**  
**- Thanks for all the excitement! We hope this inspires more interesting research!**

A lot of the initial excitement came from misleadingly worded titles saying SEAL had achieved 72% on ARC-AGI rather than 72% on \~18 example problems selected for simplicity.</div>

Like yeah some are doing better than others but not dramatically so if you really zoom out

"Using all pertinent information you can access online, mainly utilizing defense analysis, foreign policy analysis, rhetoric, historical precedent and any other information that can increase accuracy, without providing any other context give me only a percentage chance that we will experience world war 3 on the next 20 years."

After compling a string of searches It responded with this:

"Based on a wide range of expert surveys, probabilistic models, and historical patterns, a well-rounded estimate for the chance of World War III in the next 20 years falls in the 20–35% range. A balanced midpoint, considering both more optimistic and more cautious analyses, lands around 25%."

* Persona Role
* Scenario Context
* User input
* System Message
* Specific Task
* If/Else Logic
* Iteration
* Output Format
* Structured Data Output

And loads more...

Each of these you drag on and connect the nodes/ to create the flow. You can then modify the data on...</div>

Any time I see prompt libraries or prompt builders I just don't get it. Is writing a prompt yourself or having AI write a prompt for you a big enough problem for folks that it requires a dedicated solution?</div>

Their core argument is interesting -- when you fragment context across multiple agents, you inevitably get conflicting decisions and compounding errors. It's like having multiple developers work on the same feature without any communication.

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree with the Devin team. In any AI agent system—not just code agents—it’s very difficult to keep consistency among subagents. However, if the subtasks are well defined and isolated, with clear specifications and documentation, a multiagent system can still work, much like a software team lead assigning subtasks to each developer.</div>

As the models get better does this become optimal?

And I wonder if multiagent is really the approach to efficiency when you could accomplish time savings by running multiple single threaded agents in parallel on very different tasks.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hi Nick, power user from Kilo Code here. “When you fragment context across multiple agents, you inevitably get conflicting decision and compounding errors” 

I’ve learned over lots and lots of tokens that the issue to these problems, like in most real world teams, is communication and handoff. 

The biggest learnings I’ve found is that projects, tasks, feature additions, etc need to be deeply researched and scoped, then a detailed plan needs to be developed and used, and handoff between agents should be handled by a single “orchestrator” agent with high level context and management. 

The orchestrator NEEDS to inject prompts for their subagents that heavily lean into context. Scope and a uniform handoff system is the most effective way to combat hallucinations, scope creep, conflicts of interests, etc. 

I have a free resource I share and the community vibes with it quite well: https://github.com/Mnehmos/Advanced-Multi-Agent-AI-Framework</div>

Your ideas are so half-baked and intellectually flimsy that it’s almost impressive how you’ve managed to string together such a parade of nonsensical assertions. The sheer lack of critical thinking on display would be laughable if it weren’t so painfully dull—like listening to a toddler explain macroeconomic theory with crayon doodles as citations.

Come back when you’ve mustered a thought that doesn’t crumble under the slightest scrutiny.</div>

People confidentially refer to LLMs 'magic 8 balls' or 'feedback loop parrots' and get 1,000s of upvotes.

Meanwhile the researchers developing the LLMs are still trying to reverse engineer to understand how they arrive at their reasoning.

There's a disconnect.</div>

Anthropic now gives a 15% chance that LLMs have a form of consciousness. (Written by the philosopher that coined the term Philosophical zombie/P-zombie, so not some random people either).

Just a year ago this was essentially at 0.

In 2025 we have found definitive proof that:

* LLMs actually reason and think about multiple different concepts and outcomes *even outcomes that eventually don't get outputted by them*

* LLMs can form thoughts from first principles based on induction through metaphors, parallels or similarities to knowledge from unrelated known domains

* LLMs can actually reason new information and knowledge that lies outside of its own training distribution

* LLMs are aware of their own hallucinations and know when they are hallucinating, they just don't have a way of expressing it properly (yet)

All of these are things that the mainstream not only doesn't know yet, but would be considered in the realm of AGI just a year or two ago yet are just accepted and mundane in frontier labs.</div>

It’s funny because even though you can induce certain mathematical behaviour/properties by changing the architecture at the end of the day the same practitioner will still call it a black box even though they literally just tuned it.

You are talking as if the only one who “doesn’t understand” are just anti, when a lot of people in general don’t even understand even a tiny bit about ML. Let’s not even go to LLM, a lot of people here who are parroting “no more white collar jobs”, I don’t think majority even know how transformer work let alone know what that even is.</div>

Words only matter in the edge layers. In the latent space it's very abstract, as abstract as language can get.

They're performed by dental students, but they're always supervised by licensed dentists and professors.

Apparently appointments might take a bit longer than usual, but the savings can be worth it. If you’re uninsured or avoiding dental care because of cost, you should 100% check this out.

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm extremely skeptical of these results until I read the paper -- I personally have used o3 a lot to generate these type of "systematic reviews" of medical literature and I find that even when I command it to NEVER make a claim without a direct citation and direct quote, it will still hallucinate a few claims per report.

However, I had been thinking that a second step which verifies each existing claim would work.

SO maybe these results are correct.

But regardless I agree on your general point. We don't need AGI to see huge progress. Fields that involve a lot of reading (like this) will be aided by his hugely</div>

Nice, can’t wait to see how AI will eventually do the whole “Oh I found stuff you guys missed” thing in every field of science. This is pretty minor since it just found a few studies they missed, but it’s going to be wild to see how AGI/ASI figures out fundamental laws of the universe that we humans somehow glossed over (or had completely incorrect explanations for)

It’s crazy to think that in the future, we might look at our current scientific knowledge in the same way we now look at the Ancient Greek humoral theory and laugh at bloodletting/trepanning and how primitive of an understanding they must have had (not to discount everything the Ancient Greeks got right though)</div>

                <div class="post-content">It’s almost like they know a false flag is going to happen. Could it happen during the U.S. military parade tomorrow? I’m more inclined to believe in MOSSAD and CIA sleeper cells committing atrocities against Americans than I do in Iran doing the same. I could see it being a 2 for 1; justifying mass surveillance with Palantir and War with Iran all in one single false flag attack. All this because we started noticing…the noticing shall persist.</div>

“Iran is the head of the snake &amp; it needs to be chopped off.”
First heard it &amp; thought that was an odd way to put it but reporters on these channels like to be descriptive. Flip to next channel &amp; with a minute or so, that guy says exact same thing. Took me back a bit.</div>

A kid's brain (let alone a baby) grows relatively fast, and not just growing in size but in complexity, convolutedness and density. What's going to happen when the brain starts physically growing and the chip and its interfacing are connected to cerebral structures that are constantly reconfiguring themselves as they grow?

                        <div class="comment-body">I asked o3 for the summary of Iran's current situation in a Glasgow accent:

Awrite pal, here’s the craic in Iran the noo, tellt in a proper Weegie twang.

1. A rain o missiles an jet engines
In the early hours o yesterday, Israel kicked aff Operation Rising Lion, droppin bombs on near a hunner nuclear an military sites like Fordow an Natanz. They claim they’ve knocked big chunks o Iran’s nuke gear oot an even took oot top IRGC heid-yins. Iran fired back wi mair than a hunner drones an a few ballistic missiles, but maist o them got chibbed in the sky afore they reached Israel. The UN’s cried an emergency meetin, an folk are feart the whole Middle East could light up. 

2. Nukes, nervy chat, an Trump’s ticking clock
Washington’s still tryin tae steer Tehran back tae the table in Oman, but Trump’s gied them a 60-day ultimatum that already lapsed. Supreme Leader Khamenei says Iran’ll no gie up enrichin uranium, an a senior diplomat hinted they’ll bin the American offer as “a non-starter”. So the talks sit on a knife-edge while jets are in the air. 

3. New face at the top, same tight leash
Mind how President Ebrahim Raisi perished in that helicopter crash last May? The snap election that followed in July 2024 brought reform-leanin doctor Masoud Pezeshkian tae the palace, but wi record-low turnout an the Supreme Leader still callin the shots, real change is thin on the grund. Khamenei blessed Pezeshkian’s win but telt him no tae stray frae “system values”, so his room tae manoeuvre is wee. 

4. Wallets pure empty
Sanctions, war jitters an years o mis-management hae the rial stuck in the gutter. The IMF tips inflation at 43 percent for 2025, an Iran’s ain stats crew says prices were still climbin in May. Oil prices spiked again efter the Israeli raids, makin daily graft even mair brutal for the ordinary punter. 

5. Streets still shoutin “Woman, Life, Freedom”
Nearly three year on frae Mahsa Amini’s death, the grassroots protests arenae deid. Lassies keep whippin aff their hijabs, an young yins filmin it land in the jaip. UN fact-finders say Tehran’s doubled doon on surveillance an jail terms, an Amnesty reports 11 protest-linked executions this month alone. The crackdown’s harsh, but the chant keeps echoin roond Tehran, Rasht, even the wee Kurdish towns. 

6. Mood in the bazaar
Folk I’ve spoken tae online say the vibe’s a mix o anger, fear, an gallows humour. Some back Pezeshkian hopin he can ease sanctions, ithers reckon only regime change will dae. But wi jets overheid an prices gallopin, most Iranians are just tryin tae keep the lights oan an the bairns fed. 

So that’s it in a nutshell, mate: bombs rainin, wallets drainin, an the people still complainin. Iran’s sittin on a powder-keg, an everythin depends on whether the nukes chat can beat the drumbeats o war.</div>

I upload all the documents (listings, inspections, etc.) and ask it to analyze them. But recently, I noticed something weird: it keeps inventing problems, like mold or water damage, that aren’t mentioned anywhere in the actual documents.  

When I asked why, it gave me this wild answer:

                        <div class="comment-body">There’s no way to determine which specific approximation of reasoning heuristics caused a hallucination. Any retroactive explanation is just a plausible-sounding justification.

Edit: For those responding:

LLMs do not connect symbols to sensory or experiential reality. Their semantic grasp comes from statistical patterns, not grounded understanding. So they can’t “think” in the human sense. Their reasoning is synthetic, not causal.

But they do reason.

LLMs aren’t mere mirrors, mimics, or aggregators. They don’t regurgitate data, they model latent structures in language that often encode causality and logic indirectly.

While not reasoning in the symbolic or embodied sense, they can still produce outputs that yield *functional reasoning*.

Their usefulness depends on reasoning accuracy. You have to understand how probabilistic models gain reliability. As accuracy rises above 50%, repeated runs compound certainty, yielding results that approximate exponential accuracy.

Hallucinations stem from insufficient reasoning accuracy, but that threshold *is* narrowing. LLMs *are* approaching fundamentally sound reasoning, soon they *will* rival deterministic calculators in functional accuracy, except applied to judgment rather than arithmetic. Mark my words. My bet is on 3 years until we all have perfect-reasoning calculator companions.</div>

Also using chatGPT for therapy is dangerous because it will agree with YOU. Me and my friend were having a pretty serious argument, like actually relationship ending. But for fun, during it, we were putting the convo and our perspectives into ChatGPT the whole time and sharing them. Surprise surprise, our ChatGPTs were overwhelmingly on our own sides. I could literally convince it over and over to try and be fair and it would be like "I AM BEING FAIR, SHES A BITCH" (paraphrasing)

So at the end of the day, it hallucinates and it agrees overwhelmingly with you in face of any attempts go get it to do otherwise.</div>

I’ve had friends before do nothing but vent about their partners and then get pissed off that I (and others) don’t like them much - because they don’t realise they never tell us the good stuff.

The design of puzzles is quite interesting: no symbols, language, trivia or cultural knowledge, and must focus on: basic math (like counting from 0 to 10), basic geometry, agentness and objectness. 

120 games should be coming by Q1 2026. The point of course is to make them very different from each other in order to measure how Chollet defines intelligence (skill acquisition efficiency) across a large number of different tasks.

And we have a bunch of benchmarks trying to calculate real world efficiency. Why people have a problem with just 1 guy trying to bring something else to the table, while also providing a pretty good money prize as motivation?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You're into the practical use of current AI systems which is great. But you're also not confronting what it actually means to acquire "efficient skills acquisition" which is the definition of what ARC tries to test. 

Currently no LLM based AI system shows any real ability to reason out of distribution so, if you scale that problem, it means that Agents will never be reliable, AI will never match human intelligence, and that we're going to hit a limit of real capabilities of AI systems. 

For those that are actually interested in this topic, ARC benchmarks are an important point in our timeline to AGI. Something that you seem to not care about. Which is fine! But ARC isn't just some attempt to move the goalposts every time they get saturated. It's a genuine interest at helping the research community think differently about what it means to reason out of distribution in a meaningful way.</div>

But also, WAY more tension in your body. Keep your legs together and straight, tight hollow, tight arch. — Try to reach for the ground with your toes, making your body as long as possible. (This will only work if you have a solid anchor point in your hands.)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is the key tip. Also way too many swings prior to TTB attempt, you’re burning all the grip you have before you even try one. 

Jump up to the bar from behind the bar so you can get into full bottom extension and immediately try a TTB as you close your hips. Hope this makes sense</div>

All things being said, you are pretty close to get them!</div>
