Some sections had almost 6 months wait until someone could perform a first reading. The patient would have already gotten their second imaging exam before the first was answered. Some of them had acute conditions too. As someone who's job is on the line if AI takes over image reading, 6 months is completely unacceptable, and even a mediocre AI reading is probably better than nothing.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Used AI to summarise a transcript of a meeting. The original zoom transcript was all over the place, with misspellings and misinterpretations. Chat GPT worked out the purpose of the meeting, the roles of the people involved and what the output/next steps would be - all gleaned from what was said. The bit that really impressed me was when it referred to the name of an artist we'd all mentioned. On the original transcript it wasn't spelled correctly/consistently at all. It seemed like an interpretive leap that (without any additional context) few people could make.</div>

I don't copy any of the code it produces either, I just need an example how it should look in general and then I work out my own code from that. 

Best way I can equate it is that, for code, ChatGPT is a cane, not a set of crutches, you should lean on it but not remotely near your full weight (if that makes any sense). If you lean into it too hard, you're going to have a very bad time.</div>

It breaks the code, it adds features that don't work, and when I ask it to fix the bugs, it adds unnecessary logs, and, most frustratingly, it takes a lot of time that could've been spent coding and understanding the codebase. I don't know where all these people are coming from that say, "I one-shot prompted this," or "I one-shot that."

I purchased $30 worth of api tokens for claude code, just to try it out, and in my whole 36 years on this planet, never been this blown away by a technology. I am more in awe than when I first began to explore genAI with gpt-2 back in 2019. Its a literal game changer.

To test, I picked a random project that I had in my backlog, truthfully thinking it was going to be a slightly more seamless version of whats already out there, but it literally one-shotted a functional scaffold. Within 2 hours I had a working prototype. Within 6 hours I had a usable and relatively robust tool.

To get to this stage just raw dogging it, would have taken me a month. With traditional copy/paste o3 or whatever, it would have maybe taken me 1-2 weeks.  But 6 hours. Insane.

The only real reason I can think of for your experience was that (and I'm assuming you're using claude code here), you didn't do any of the recommended setup/best practices. I spent 30-40 min setting this up, using both 4.1 and sonnet to create a robust plan and detailed steps. Read this guide.

Its, of course, not perfect, it can get stuck in loops or struggle at times, but finding ways to understand the issues and think creatively on how to interact with it to solve them means you can quickly work your way through.</div>

Agentic coding has straight up blown me away. The first time I used it was probably more similar to OP, but it just took a bit of understanding what Claude is actually doing and how to setup my prompts to be effective. There’s a learning curve for sure, and you still need to understand what you’re doing, especially for bigger projects, but definitely a productivity boost.</div>

I have no sympathy for christians as they choose mindless group think over independent thought simply because it's easier to let someine else do their thinking and choosing for them. They blindly accept whatever is spoon fed to them by the church and somehow feel morally superior as they do so. Fuckin' dumb.</div>

Many times I would pause and look up terms, because obviously a lot of these discussions are way above my pay grade. But that was genuinely intriguing.

Now he's just like everyone else. The further these people move away from their educational intrigue and the more Rogansphere people they bring in, the worse and more pseudointellectual these podcasts get. Really unfortunate.</div>

He has been grifting.

I stopped after the first few..when he goes so far out of his area of expertise...and acts as though he is an expert.

The ones where he interviewed Andy Galpin (?) were OK because of the guest.

"If biometric sensors register what happens to the heart rate and brain activity of millions of people as they watch a particular news item on their smartphones, that can teach the computer network far more than just our general political affiliation. The network could learn precisely what makes each human angry, fearful, or joyful. The network could then both predict and manipulate our feelings, selling us anything it wants—be it a product, a politician, or a war."

It can make totalitarianism easier to maintain, can be worse than 1984. Automated police force also sounds worrying if used by bad actors.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think he was thinking perfect Orwellian *1984*. Aside from the pop culture references many make, that book goes deep on a bunch of really disturbing things. But the perfectly stable society Orwell imagined was limited by the technology he could imagine.

Think of this:
- Constant barrage of news to keep you glued to info
- Every statement must be taken as fact whether you agree or not, and if you don’t believe it enough, you’ll get educated. Forced gaslighting.
- Everything under perfect surveillance, your every move tracked
- Honey pots created to try and out dissidents or those who have creative thinking at all
- Country lead by hate for enemies that change at the whim of those in charge 

We already have the early stages of all this. Any human with enough access to AI can spew out propaganda at a scale every despot in history would have burned it all down to get.

AI is made by humans with agendas. If AGI were to come from the AI humans made, then why wouldn’t the AGI be biased by human agendas?

And if humans wants perfect information control and a compliant society, why wouldn’t AGI?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">When I started, for about 1 year I used to have extreme aversion towards feeling the body. I'd subconsciously 'ground' myself all day in sights and sounds, or a mantra to avoid feeling. Of course this is impossible in the long run, so when the sensations I was desperately trying to avoid inevitably came back with full force, there was a lot of suffering!

I think we have to go through these naive phases in our meditation journey and see for ourselves what truly brings release and what brings the opposite. The mind is a very stubborn entity and it likely won't register what other people say, it has to go through its own journey and feel the suffering deeply for things to click.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If you suppress it, when emotion hit you in daily life, you’ll be more aggressive than people who don’t meditate, because you suppress it.

In Buddhism, we teach to be mindful of the emotion instead of suppressing them. When emotion arise in meditation, just aware of it(not suppress) then gradually bring back to you object of meditation. This way will not get stressed. Always remember, happiness is cause of right samadhi, you cannot have right samadhi when your mind is stressed.

Even when you don’t meditate, try to be mindful of your emotion during the day too.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is certainly a concern. But also imagine what innovations humans cook up to resist and fight back against such waves.

The problem is that bots are abundant and automatic, littering every square inch of the internet. But again... that just raises the anticipation of what sort of innovations will be experimented with against that.

We're already bleeding into human IDs, at least with World (Sama's eye orb company). It's a matter of time before platforms finally drop the gate and require such IDs in order to post. So, there's a pathway in our future where all bots get blocked at that gate.

Granted, this probably won't fix the problem. Why not let me sign in, and then I activate my bots? They may be throttled by too much activity, so I may have to slow it waaaaaay down, but I can still go to bed while it posts at a human-rate.

Still bad, sure. But dozens of orders of magnitudes better than how bad it's getting and can get.

Mr Rogers said look for the helpers. But I'm antsy to look for the innovators.

I swear to god I've always talked like this even before LLMs stole my cadence. Which I only mention because I'm looking over my comment and thinking *"why do I kinda sound like a bot, fuck."*</div>

The different versions of Copilot (365, Azure, regular, GitHub, phone app…) are confusing me haha.

                        <div class="comment-body">Bit of a leading question but is there a sense in the team/org that you guys got beaten to the punch by cursor and co and are now playing catchup? I'm curious as to how the team/org see copilot in terms of market positioning, use case, feature offering vs cursor and windsurf as well as roo/cline though their value proposition is different. Is converting people from those offerings to your own a goal, are you more interested in converting existing vs code vanilla users etc?

From my own perspective it always feels like vs code/copilot introduces features long after cline, roo, cursor and windsurf have already implemented them and I'm struggling to understand what approach MS is taking toward the product in general.</div>

I do agree that some features we were slow to roll out, but looking at the past 4 months I am very proud of the pace the team is shipping features. I can't say we are lagging behind competitors - though I would love to hear your thoughts if you disagree. As for the approach we are taking - we are all-in towards making VS Code the open source AI editor.

As for your first question, I suggest you watch this podcast where Erich and Kai go in more detail [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMmaYUcdMyU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMmaYUcdMyU)</div>

We're still in the "foundational research" phase, with plenty of basic questions unanswered. AlphaEvolve is just the first stepping stone toward getting LLMs to produce novel insights, and there are many more such stepping stones currently being researched.

The only real dead end is the "just a parrot/advanced autocomplete" crowd.</div>

Name one technology that has realistically hit a wall in the last few years. Everything keeps on advancing upward and onward.

Perhaps there is a wall, but it's so far beyond our comprehension we're not anywhere close to that yet.

I've stopped listening to them though. Every generation has a group of people that doubt something is possible, but as history has always shown us, they've always been wrong.</div>

Its really not hard to pay lip service in a short clip to a cause that is extremely popular,  most ISREALIS, let alone people around the world are against what Isreal is doing in Gaza.

whats hard is having principles, and Theo literally released this video in between having dinner with Kushner (currently gathering investors to develop the land isreal is stealing in gaza) and going on tour with Trump (currently helping Iareal orchestrate an ethnic cleansing)

Theo had Gabor Mate in, who is a holocaust survivor and understands trauma really well as it is his expertise.

Theo gets pretty emotional about it all so he’s been feeling bad about this for awhile.

He's building pretty complex programs with no coding knowledge beyond SQL (we both worked in analytics). Some of the stuff he's putting together mirror things my teams have spent huge sums of money to get designed a decade ago, and his have capabilities far beyond what ours did.

One of his side projects is creating a wikipedia for a game purely by letting it scrape YouTube videos and his personal gameplay. Unreal</div>

I understand “how” to code (studied computing in the 90s… used BASIC and some C) but I don’t know much about current languages and standards etc. 

But… I’m still coding pretty complex stuff through “natural language programming”. And I’m picking it up as I go. Like language immersion. 

It really is a massive game changer for someone like me who knows theory and roughly how to structure stuff etc but doesn’t (well, *didn’t*) actually know any current languages. 

I imagine it’s highly useful for someone who knows one language but wants/needs to use another they never learned. You just pick it up as you go. 

And as the tools get better the knowledge necessary to use them is going to continue to decrease.</div>

At the same time, the market was still growing — computers were being sold, and the world hadn't yet reached saturation.

Today, however, the world is saturated with computers, and the market has stopped expanding.

And now, we are given neural networks. This is a real factor contributing to the crisis.</div>

Every one of those technologies made something once obscure and inaccessible available to almost everyone. A decade ago, someone like me could build a website with zero coding skills.  
  
Today, you can build simple apps without any technical background and use AI to tackle more complex problems if you're a professional.

I was with you until here.

There have been computers in every household since the early 2000s and smartphones in every hand for over a decade, but the demand for software is still increasing. "The market" is not computers / hardware exclusively, it's software too, and I don't think we are anywhere *near* "saturating" that market.</div>

But AI has the potential of making jobs obsolete at a rate that can't be absorbed by other jobs, leading to rapidly growing unemployment. We're not there at the moment though.</div>

However, in any half-decent marriage however there is total marital confidentiality. So it doesn't really matter that the person you tell something secret to will share it with his husband/wife, since he/she (ideally) doesn't have another wife/husband with whom she/he inevitable shares this with.</div>

My general rule with my wife is that if she asks, I'll tell her that I've been asked to keep it secret. If she presses, I'll tell her. I don't keep secrets from her.</div>
