                        <div class="comment-body">It literally is a mind warping parasite. Like most of the focus is on attention spans and wasted time. But what we surround ourselves with affects us on a fundamental level it all seeps into the subconscious and shapes how we think and ultimately who we are and the internet is a constant companion. And due to it's ease of access we don't need to literally be plugged into the internet to have it become part of our minds, we check our phones instead of self reflect when bored, when we have a question it starts to become instinctual to check our phones before we even think about it ourselves. And so those mental pathways start to atrophy and get replaced by the internet effectively making us more of an NPC and less ourselves. And then it becomes compulsive and you can't seem to leave despite wanting to because it has a stranglehold on your mind

Also on the male pattern baldness stuff if it hasn't advanced to far you can always take finnastride it won't reverse it but it does prevent it from progressing. Basically male pattern baldness isn't caused by Testosterone but by DHT(Dihydrotestosterone) which is metabolized from T. And you don't need DHT after puberty so it won't cause any weird effects like blocking T would while saving your hair.</div>

Here is one example (McDonald’s in attached image)

&gt;You know that old joke where a Greek philosopher goes;

&gt; “And that is why reality doesn’t exist!”

This is known as the [Appeal to the Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_the_stone), and it wasn't a Greek philosopher who said that, but [Samuel Johnson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Johnson).

Johnson's biographer, James Boswell, wrote about the event this way:

&gt; After we came out of the church, we stood talking for some time together of [Bishop Berkeley's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley) ingenious sophistry to prove the non-existence of matter, and that every thing in the universe is merely ideal. I observed, that though we are satisfied his doctrine is not true, it is impossible to refute it. I never shall forget the alacrity with which Johnson answered, striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone, till he rebounded from it, "I refute it thus."

Of course, this doesn't refute anything.  Both the stone and the pain you experience could be "all in your head" and have no relation to the "outer world" (if there is one) or to mind-independent reality (or "objective reality").. if there is one.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That's based on Samuel Johnson's refutation of Berkeley's subjective idealism. "I refute it thus!" said Johnson and kicked a stone.

There's a similar story told of Greek philosopher Diogenes, who refuted an argument that said movement was impossible by walking away.</div>

I drew from memory what I witnessed in hopes that someone may have some answers for me. I remember the craft being black or a dark color and having green lights underneath of it. 

I was laying in bed and felt my house shaking. A loud rumble / vibration above me. It kept getting louder and louder and the house shaking more and more. I thought at first it was a plane.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/lmarksart:

---

Last year in March late at night I saw what I believe to be some type of craft. I vividly remember the loud rumble / house shaking and the color lights being green. There weren’t any other colors emitting from the craft aside green. The body of the craft is a dark color like grays or black. It was incredibly large and took up a large part of my visible sky from my window upstairs. 

I have texts I sent to close people in my life explaining what I saw to them right after it happened. I really wish I took a video or a picture but it all happened so fast and I was expecting it to be a plane, not whatever I saw that night.

**I’d also like to add the craft was probably lower than what I drew and the craft might’ve been a little more wider, but I tried my best lol**

Ukraine disarmed a stockpile of over +1700 nuclear arsenal after the Cold War in exchange for security guarantees from the United States, the UK, France, China and Russia.  

These security guarantees are to:

1. Respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.


2. Reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine.


3. Refrain from economic coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by Ukraine of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind.

Under Putin, Russia has abandoned this agreement and has been desparate to claw back old Soviet territory.

Ukraine was invaded by Russia. As a weapon of war Russia has raped, pillaged &amp; slaughtered people en mass just as the Nazis did in 1939 Poland.  And just like 1939 Poland -  it will not stop in Ukraine.  Putin wants more. 

Supporting Ukraine is not some charitable gift. All signatory nations of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons have an obligation to fulfil their side of the agreement.

We're repeating the same events again and again. How many people need to die this time, so we can end this fascist bullshit?


Edit:  

The notion that NATO expansion somehow justifies Russia’s invasion of Ukraine - or worse, caused it - is baseless. Russia wanted and chose to invade Ukraine regardless of NATO.

Putin fuels this narrative that Russia was wronged when it lost its Soviet-era sphere of influence, but that grievance doesn’t justify aggression against sovereign nations. Putin has openly denied Ukraine’s sovereignty, claiming that it is not a real country and should be part of Russia. 

This invasion is not about security concerns - it is about imperial ambition.

NATO is a collective defence alliance, meaning that if a member NATO starts a war, there is no obligation for other members to assist them. When the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, NATO as an organisation did not participate, and key members like Canada, France, and Germany refused to join the war. This is clear evidence that NATO is not an aggressive expansionist force; it doesn't pose a threat unless you *intend to go to war with NATO.*

As for NATO being 'on Russia's doorstep' - Russia’s sovereignty ends at its borders, just like every other nation's. If Russia has a problem with its neighbours joining NATO, it is objecting to their sovereignty, not defending its own.

Russia has no right to dictate whether independent nations can join NATO. That’s the entire point of sovereignty.  In reality, Russia opposes NATO because the alliance prevents it from leaving a bloody trail of destruction across Europe. 

If Russia was genuinely interested in peace, NATO wouldn’t be a concern for them in the first place.</div>

Just like many of you here, for the longest time I thought I was just lazy. I really wanted to do things, be on a diet, workout more, start a business, and so on. However, most often than not, I found myself spending time on the bed. I could sleep 10 hours at night, and still have a craving for it, so much...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I also had similar problems, did a sleep study and found that I did not have sleep apnea. However, I recently started tracking my sleep with my Apple Watch, and while it’s not perfect it was saying I was waking up 10+ times a night and getting 4-19 minutes of deep sleep per night! I’ve started becoming interested in getting that number up and improving my sleep hygiene. I bought an eye mask with built-in headphones that’s comfortable to sleep in for $20 and started listening to deep sleep meditations to fall asleep (and enjoying that I hear less of my surroundings which also helps me stay asleep), eating more fiber, running more, sleeping in a cool room, stretching before bed, limiting screentime for an hour before bed, and stopping food intake 2-3 hours before bed. Last night I only had 4 instances of wakefulness (which is very normal) and got an hour of deep sleep for the first time since tracking my sleep a month ago (according to my watch which again—not perfect). I used to pass out in the middle of watching TV at 12:30 am after a bag of peanut butter M&amp;Ms, on top of which my whole body was constantly tense and I wasn’t aware of it, so my sleep wasn’t restful even though I could fall asleep quickly. Echoing OP that sleep issues are a big deal!!! But not all sleep issues are apnea. My mood and energy levels are way better already from two weeks of more restful sleep. </div>

Y’all are losing social security. NATO is legitimately on the table for being scrapped. You have a billionaire that suddenly has been awarded a government contract to provide electric vehicles to the military, just for being in the room.

He’s always leaned right, I don’t get how anyone’s confused by this tweet. Theo’s a comedian and he’s funny, I don’t know why anyone even cares about the political views of comedians. Just laugh at their jokes or don’t watch them if you don’t think they’re funny. This sub is so obsessed with politics.

I don’t agree with Louis CK jerking off in front of women, but I’ll still watch him because he’s funny.</div>

Story got buried...

Barber came out with outlandish (to the uninitiated anyway),They all came out....
 Viewership on this channel has decreased.

It's all so desensitizing . Video is completely un appealing to me anymore with Ai. And if you have a picture.  Literally GTFO

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes. The interest dropped significantly when many of the top voices for disclosure came out in support of people claiming they can summon UFOs at wil with their psychic powers but they can't produce any evidence whatsoever and several of them were spotted and photographed at a place in California that comes off to a significant amount of people as very culty. How do I know? I am one of those people who lost interest after that happened, because I can believe that aliens exist, but it's ***significantly*** harder for me to believe that a select elite few are able to command UAP at will but they don't need to produce evidence or proof and I'm supposed to continuously buy into their claims and never question them and also buy their book and support their organization.</div>

No progress has been made towards building  credibility or reaching more people.

I worked with other companies, mainly in HR, and I recently ran an experiment before retiring. I tracked every minute of focused work - real, high-effort tasks like writing reports, deep analysis, or complex problem solving. The result? On most days, I barely hit 2.5-3 hours of genuine, productive work. The rest was...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yeah studies have shown the average for an office worker is 3-4 hours of productive work a day, and the rest is procrastination / waffle / pointless meetings etc. I'd relate to this as well from my own office work. 

I do have some friends who claim they genuinely work 8 hours + each day, but they're in pretty high powered positions like lawyers and architects where they get a constant stream of work to do which isn't common at a typical office job.

Biggest benefit of work from home is letting workers do the work they need to do in their own time and use the rest to improve their lives, rather than idle away in an office pointlessly.</div>

It's a small sample size of questions and tested on a small number of humans so the uncertainty here is bound to be pretty big.

Also, this is mostly text translations of visual problems in the style of Raven's Matrices. That is only one form of task that is used in IQ tests. In more comprehensive test batteries like WAIS, many other faculties are taken into consideration for full scale IQ.

My guess is that the models would score even higher on the full scale WAIS, although some of the subtests cannot be meaningfully used with LLMs because they don't have the same limitations of working memory and processing speed as humans do.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">For me the specific lmarena metric that has always been the goto is Hard Prompts w/ Style Control. This is the one that matches most closely with all other benchmarks and general expectations and the hardest for companies to game. This is where you could see Claude 3.5 Sonnet at #1 even 5 months after release when it was far surpassed in the overall category (and which also aligned closely with general experience). This also where models like o1 and R1 are also at #1. This is the first time I have seen a model take the lead so convincingly here.

The GPT-4.5 preview might be the better one now, but that’s to be expected given its steep price. However, if you look at the rate of improvement, xAI really takes the cake.

ive already given up twitter, instagram and tiktok completely, but reddit is the final barrier as im addicted. i read that giving up something for lent is supposed to be truly hard (compared to giving up something small like chocolate), this could be a good option for everyone, and then u also can celebrate easter and eat all the chocolate</div>

But let’s skip the kumbaya circle for a second. This thing isn’t your friend; it’s a bunch of algorithms predicting your next word.

If you start leaning on a chatbot for emotional support, you’re basically outsourcing your reality check to a glorified autocomplete. That’s risky territory. The temporary feelings might feel validating, but remember:
