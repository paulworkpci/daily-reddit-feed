For those of you who thought for a while about deleting reddit but didn't find the motivation, please delete it right now, and then use a website blocker and block the URL. If you spend most of your time scrolling on popular, it is high time you delete the app. Go on and replace the time you spent on reddit on another hobby.

That was a very dark time of my life, so I deleted my reddit account to start over. Now I'm back here again. Why? Reddit is worse than it has ever been before, so why not stay gone? Well, I just like reading other people's stories, it gives me a feeling of connection, you know? And there's a lot of subreddits to enjoy too. You like science? They have that. You're interested in math, they have that too. You like art? Check out some art! You like anime? There's anime galore here! I'm not on here as much as I used to be (thank god), but every now and then I'll come here and see what's up. Balance is key.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">CRISPR-Cas9 is actual Jurassic Park shit.

People who were born blind have had their sight regained due to genetic tinkering made possible by this biological tech.

Mosquitos can be eliminated, practically eradicating Malaria by editing the genes, which are then passed on to offspring, making them sterile.

Food can be, and has been, made more nutritious, as in the case of Golden Rice, producing more Vitamin A in impoverished countries.

It’s Gattaca in the flesh, and people just shrugged

Edit: A lot of people are asking "Why do I still have mosquitos? or Why hasn't this happened yet??" and I can say that this technology is still extremely nascent.

It's a massive achievement of humanity and another foothold in our ability to shape nature, but it is still inaccurate. Targeting specific genes in different species, let alone our own, is time-consuming and requires many trials to get right.

Targeting multiple genes, at the same time, is exponentially more difficult. Remember that genes are just DNA sequences at random events on the entire chain. And each sequence is rarely actually next to each other on the chain.

Some of you have also mentioned that we don't fully understand the effect this would have on not only one species but all those others that interact with whichever we were trying to alter.

In short.. It's incredibly high-tech, and with incredible technology comes incredible questions and incredible consequences that need to be considered before fully deploying.</div>

would there be any negative side effects to that, like within the food chain? or do mosquitos not really factor in much in the grand scheme of things?

It's infuriating to me what is going on with PEPFAR and USAID. For essentially 24 cents of every $100 spent on foreign aid, American taxpayers have helped keep 26 million people alive over the last 20 years. Now... all that is gone — or worse, gone into reverse. 

Families, individuals, women and children and health care workers are dying because their medications are no longer accessible. 

It's maddening. Like, what you said, we've got this. We can do this. But there is no will to sustain it. 24 cents per 100 dollars. Come. On.

I typically ignore my needs when excited and I think it's the root. You know how some little kids will have an accident when playing because they're having so much fun they don't want to get up and go to the bathroom? I think it's similar to that. 

I won't eat, won't drink, I wait until the last possible second to pee, hide what I'm thinking sometimes (ie: not saying what I really want when picking food or a movie or give my opinion on what someone is saying), and stay at least an hour two past my social battery limit (sometimes several hours past my limit). This combination of not listening to my body and filtering myself too much leaves me a pile of wet pulp the next day.

The DJ app would curate playlists, I am convinced, just to weasel in a few more of her plays.

                                <div class="reply-body">I see the steps in the evolution. First, doctors will use AI to either confirm their diagnosis and avoid misdiagnosis, with or without patient awareness of this use. We might even get doctors advertising this use once acceptance rates are high enough.

Eventually, once people feel more comfortable, they will have a choice of paying for the human doctor diagnosis or paying much less for a pure AI diagnosis. A lot of people won't have this choice: they can't afford the doctor.

At this point the whole system has crumbled further than it already has, currently.

That could happen even before it becomes either pjblicly accepted that AI does a better job, or regulated that AI **must** be used in the diagnosis.

Any government providing healthcare will *choose* to go the cheaper route (tax payer money and all that) and at some point that will be the AI model, either just for being cheaper, or for lowering healthcare costs due to effectiveness.

All of this doesn't even touch the point of ethics: at some point, leaving people without access to therapy, education, healthcare and basic services, purely because you can't afford human service even when AI - perhaps even not as effective as humans - is available for much cheaper and it becomes an ethical issue: is it better to provide an AI tutor for children in an area where paying for teachers is not a possibility or should they be left without an education?</div>

You're close but the therapeutic effect is real.

It turns out people do poorly when they feel that someone isn't taking care of them. The reverse is also true.

It might be that nurses/doctors convert more to someone that interacts between the AI and explain things to you in a way that helps with the therapeutic effect.

That is until robots can jump past the uncanny valley and are MORE compassionate than humans.

Which should take 3-4 more months.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Am medical student. I use it very often. It is amazing at finding those small obscure details and weird interactions between drugs. I do a lot of question banks to learn and since using gpt-4o it has not gotten a SINGLE ONE wrong I struggled with.  (Was maybe trained on it but so what? I am training on it too.)

It is so amazing because you can ask EXACTLY what you want, and it will give it. When I have to ask google that, it takes me long time to find what I am looking for.

For those that think “You should know those things if you’re a doctor!”, yes I agree with you. But we forgot things as humans. Tragically we are quite good at recognizing things we have learned before, but terrible at recall. AI can fill in the gaps till you get to years of experience.

EDIT: Felt I needed to add a disclaimer! The questions I use it for help are all medical standardized questions, where the correct answer would be apparent as the answer would always only have one that can be correct. The bloods, labs, etc. are all given as needed to get the right answer, and NEVER to trick you. Hence, it is good cause in a sense it is “obvious” what the correct one is if you know enough. Unfortunately real life is nothing like that, and never that clear, so DO NOT TRUST IT FOR REAL WORLD DIAGNOSIS.  If you have a problem, SEE A DOCTOR!</div>

I do a lot of question banks to learn and since using gpt-4o it has not gotten a SINGLE ONE wrong I struggled with."

I'm a regular person who got correctly diagnosed by GPT one month before my doc appointment. Yesterday the doctor confirmed exactly what gpt told me a few weeks ago was wrong with my eyes. I was looking at the various supplements and medicines (eye drops, etc) used in studies on pubmed related to my issues and was asking gpt to help me understand some of the details, I, as a layman, didn't fully get. It also found some obscure connections that I the searched for on pubmed and they were there. 

After my doc's appointment, where he said exactly what I expected him to say, he prescribed me medicine which I knew he would because gpt already told me in advance. But the doc didn't go into details about how or what to combine with or stay away from, and while the pharmacist told me some of it, gpt filled in the rest of the details. Of course, I checked all the extra info that gpt gave me online, and all was correct. It was so correct, it was uncanny, I have to admit.</div>

And thats just a single protest, not a total of all of the roughly 1200 protests that have been reported. Lots of money someone has, on top of paying the people who have showed up to protest Tesla every weekend for the last couple of months.

                                <div class="reply-body">The 0% on Russia thing sounds like a smoking gun, but it’s not where you make meaningful moves right now. U.S. trade with Russia was just $3.5B in 2024—tiny compared to China, Mexico, or the EU. Most of it’s already crippled by sanctions, especially energy and high-tech goods. Adding tariffs on top would be redundant and have almost zero economic impact.

That’s actually why leaving Russia out works as subtle political theater. It gives people something surface-level to react to ("he's protecting Russia!") while distracting from the fact that the broader tariffs—10% universal, 60%+ on China—are themselves a calculated performance. They’re about pressuring the Fed, reshaping trade flows, and feeding a tough-on-trade narrative, not about fair trade or fixing inflation.

So yeah, the omission looks suspicious to people not tracking the data, but strategically, it’s noise. The real signal is how these tariffs are being used to manipulate market expectations and national sentiment—not as policy tools, but as leverage disguised as economic defense.</div>

They don’t want you be truly informed. They don’t want you to think. They want you distracted and happy, and to keep coming back for more, so they can profit off your eyeballs.</div>

Meta unveils (limited release) Llama 4 bundled with four models, all MoE and multimodal:

1. `Scout`: **109B total parameters, 17B active parameters, 16 experts**. 10M context length.
2. `Maverick`: **400B total parameters, 17B active parameters, 128 experts**. Competitive pricing and performance against Gemini Flash 2.0 and DeepSeek v3.1, distilled from Behemoth.
3. `Behemoth`: **2T total parameters, 288B active parameters, 16 experts**. Exceeds models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Pro and GPT-4.5 in certain benchmarks (*e.g. LiveCodeBench, GPQA Diamond*)
4. `Reasoning`: While not mentioned in the blog, it is [confirmed](https://www.llama.com/llama4-reasoning-is-coming/) to be coming. No details disclosed.

Speculated release of Behemoth &amp; Reasoning will be at the LlamaCon event (April 29). You may request access for Scout and Maverick [here](https://www.llama.com/llama-downloads/), HF release is expected some time later.</div>

The 'last 10%' will be the easiest, since by then the network will have enough domain optimizers to finish creating itself. It's the tedious human feedback during the bootstrapping that's the hard part.

Well, that and the hardware to run the thing on. I'm pretty sure the '100,000 GB200's' datacenters this year will be comparable to the human brain in network size, and millions of times faster when it comes to speed.

Things are gonna snowball hella fast. Maybe not 'fast' to those who want everything to happen tomorrow, but it's insane to those of us who were amazed when StackGAN released ten years ago. I knew it meant large gains were coming, but even I had vastly underestimated how large and fast they would be. I've endeavored to try to be less wrong since then, and pretty much only pay attention to scale these days..</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">When I hit 40, I realized that the habits I make now will determine how healthy I am at 60. I decided I wanted to be one of those guys of whom people say, “Wow, he’s already sixty?!” and not “Yikes, he’s only sixty?”Quit drinking, started a handful of supplements (fiber, omega 3s), and, most importantly, started a daily gym routine of strength training and yoga and cardio on off days. I’m in shape and I’ve never been healthier or felt better in my body, and the other day my friend who I hadn’t seen in half a year asked me, “how are you de-aging?!” So something’s working!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">So lets use the low numbers here. He said 400 dollars per 'Democrat' protest, and there are reports that there are roughly 1200 protests taking place in America, and lets say that there is an average of 100 protestors per protest. Lets say that only half of those people are getting paid, so 50x1200, thats 60000 people getting paid, if they are getting paid 400 dollars to be there, thats 24 million dollars. If everyone was getting paid, thats 48 million dollars.

Lets see who has 24-48 million dollars just to give out for no economic return.</div>
