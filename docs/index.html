After collecting data and fine tuning it for a few weeks, then  they started to quantize it after a few weeks to save money, then you notice  the quality starts to degrade .  Same with gemini 2.5 pro 03-24, it was good then the may version came out it was fine tuned and quantized to 3-4 bits.

The ChatGPT version of GPT-4o has an API endpoint: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/chatgpt-4o-latest, and since a few of our apps use it, we run daily benchmarks. We've never noticed any sudden performance drops or other shenanigans.

The openai subreddit has been claiming daily for years, "OMG, the model got nerfed!", and you'd think with millions of users and people scraping outputs nonstop, at least one person would have provided conclusive proof by now. But since no such proof exists, it's probably not true.</div>

"open source" isn't some magical words that can make anything happen, you still can't run a top model on your PC, so you have to find a cloud computing service to run it and then the open source models are almost never going to be at the same level as private models due to simple economic incentives, so the most likely scenario is that you get a similar strength to the quantized models while paying significantly more for it.</div>

And people would instantly notice if there were any shenanigans or sudden drops in performance. For example, we run a daily private benchmark for regression testing and have basically never encountered a nerf or stealth update, unless it was clearly communicated beforehand.

The OpenAI and ChatGPT subreddits literally have a daily "Models got nerfed!!!1111!!" post since like four year, but actual proof provided so far? Zero.

As for gemini
They literally write it in their docs that the EXP versions are better... It's their internal research version after all so I'm kinda surprised when people realize it's not the same than the version that is going to release....

It breaks the code, it adds features that don't work, and when I ask it to fix the bugs, it adds unnecessary logs, and, most frustratingly, it takes a lot of time that could've been spent coding and understanding the codebase. I don't know where all these people are coming from that say, "I one-shot prompted this," or "I one-shot that."

However, after a few iteration it gets it. I have one chat that went on for weeks, and it would remember the code from an earlier time, and adapt it for the latest requirements without much issue.

Also I have learned that some peoples easy project could be hard for some others. Yet, I'm very skeptical that people come and say they developed this cool app over the weekend without knowing any code.</div>

I purchased $30 worth of api tokens for claude code, just to try it out, and in my whole 36 years on this planet, never been this blown away by a technology. I am more in awe than when I first began to explore genAI with gpt-2 back in 2019. Its a literal game changer.

To test, I picked a random project that I had in my backlog, truthfully thinking it was going to be a slightly more seamless version of whats already out there, but it literally one-shotted a functional scaffold. Within 2 hours I had a working prototype. Within 6 hours I had a usable and relatively robust tool.

To get to this stage just raw dogging it, would have taken me a month. With traditional copy/paste o3 or whatever, it would have maybe taken me 1-2 weeks.  But 6 hours. Insane.

The only real reason I can think of for your experience was that (and I'm assuming you're using claude code here), you didn't do any of the recommended setup/best practices. I spent 30-40 min setting this up, using both 4.1 and sonnet to create a robust plan and detailed steps. Read this guide.

Its, of course, not perfect, it can get stuck in loops or struggle at times, but finding ways to understand the issues and think creatively on how to interact with it to solve them means you can quickly work your way through.</div>

On the Vectara leaderboard, o3 mini high has the second lowest hallucination rate out of all the llms measured at 0.8%, only behind gemini 2.0 flash at 0.7%¬†https://github.com/vectara/hallucination-leaderboard

For simpleQA, the highest scoring model is a reasoning model¬†https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/ai-simpleqa-leaderboard/

Even in the article, they state

&gt;The Vectara team¬†pointed out¬†that, although the DeepSeek-R1 model hallucinated 14.3 per cent of the time, most of these were ‚Äúbenign‚Äù: answers that are factually supported by logical reasoning or world knowledge, but not actually present in the original text the bot was asked to summarise.

Most of the benchmarks I've look into specifically tests non-factual things, asking either questions without answers, asking it to respond only taking into account the context, or in the worse case putting information in the context that contradicts reality. All of which is a valid benchmark, but not necessarily representative of your every day experience.

So my theory is that maybe old models have a lower hallucination rate relative to unknown content, but because they knew so much less that still resulted in significantly more overall hallucinations.</div>

Really? It matches my daily use.

I use o3 a lot to do research on medical treatments. In my custom instructions I have told it to always look for primary data, and to *always* directly quote a paper or website when making a claim so as to avoid making false claims.

Still, in every response there‚Äôs at least one hallucination. Usually something like ‚Äúthe treatment was safe with &lt;2% experiencing worsening of symptoms‚Äù and when I ask for the quote / source for that it thinks for 2 minutes and goes ‚Äúoh it looks like that‚Äôs not in the source, let me correct myself‚Äù

Whereas o1-mini would tend to make errors of omission instead (excluding valuable info / context) but much more rarely just plainly made things up.</div>

"If biometric sensors register what happens to the heart rate and brain activity of millions of people as they watch a particular news item on their smartphones, that can teach the computer network far more than just our general political affiliation. The network could learn precisely what makes each human angry, fearful, or joyful. The network could then both predict and manipulate our feelings, selling us anything it wants‚Äîbe it a product, a politician, or a war."

It can make totalitarianism easier to maintain, can be worse than 1984. Automated police force also sounds worrying if used by bad actors.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think he was thinking perfect Orwellian *1984*. Aside from the pop culture references many make, that book goes deep on a bunch of really disturbing things. But the perfectly stable society Orwell imagined was limited by the technology he could imagine.

Think of this:
- Constant barrage of news to keep you glued to info
- Every statement must be taken as fact whether you agree or not, and if you don‚Äôt believe it enough, you‚Äôll get educated. Forced gaslighting.
- Everything under perfect surveillance, your every move tracked
- Honey pots created to try and out dissidents or those who have creative thinking at all
- Country lead by hate for enemies that change at the whim of those in charge 

We already have the early stages of all this. Any human with enough access to AI can spew out propaganda at a scale every despot in history would have burned it all down to get.

AI is made by humans with agendas. If AGI were to come from the AI humans made, then why wouldn‚Äôt the AGI be biased by human agendas?

And if humans wants perfect information control and a compliant society, why wouldn‚Äôt AGI?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">it'll straight up lie about this though. Out of curiosity I was going to edit a photo, and decided to ask gpt if it could edit a photo first, not change it/make a whole new one, and it insisted over and over it was totally capable of simply editing one area without generating a brand new AI photo. I knew it was just lying, so I told it to make the edit, and got back an insanely cursed AI version of my dog,
so I said "you said you wouldn't make a brand new photo?" and this mf goes "Yep! thats the original photo with the edit you asked for" lmao</div>

She called back the old dentist and asked which teeth etc. And then said "it's funny because I just went and took x-rays and I don't have any cavities, could you explain it to my dentist?" and they refused, got agitated and then hung up on her. Can't even get healthcare without some money grubbing idiot coming along and trying to ruin your health for a few bucks.</div>

Root canal? Kick back coming from the surgeon. 

Cavities? Easy 5 min procedure, insurance pays $500. 

Ever wonder why teeth whitening ads are ALL OVER the office? $1,000 each, cash money, and sell enough the pharma company will invite you to their ‚Äúspeaker summit‚Äù as a guest of honor, oh and it happens to be in Hawaii! Bring your family too Doc!</div>

How can you be a good citizen if you don‚Äôt seek out the facts of a situation?

Even if the main stream corporation news networks and corrupt politicians want to keep you busy chasing untruths

So - this is great for civics and democracy going forward

e.g. Vscode's Copilot agent mode - does it work with a free model like Gemini 2.5? Does it work with Qwen3/Deepseek?

the other new choice seems to be Firebase Studio, is it the same results as AI studio?

what about cline/roo etc in Vscode, again using with a free llm option?</div>

It‚Äôs a lightweight VS Code extension that lets you bring your own API keys (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.). (Gemini has $300 in free credits, look it up for help) No subscriptions, no lock-ins. It's fully local, privacy-respecting, and extremely hackable.

That‚Äôs the TLDR.

If you‚Äôre looking for more than just completions ‚Äî like a real agent workflow that‚Äôs transparent and modular ‚Äî here‚Äôs how I use Roo Code to build a full AI team inside VS Code:

https://github.com/Mnehmos/Building-a-Structured-Transparent-and-Well-Documented-AI-Team

Here‚Äôs the high-level task map format I use:

# [Project Title]

## Phase 0: Setup
**Goal:** [Phase Objective]

### Task 0.1: [Setup Environment]
- Scope: [Setup boundaries]
- Expected Output: [Working baseline]

## Phase 1: Build
**Goal:** [Initial Functional Version]

### Task 1.1: [Implement Core Feature]
- Scope: ...
- Expected Output: ...

Each task is handed off with a subtask prompt like this:

# [Task Title]

## Context
[How it fits into the larger project]

## Scope
[What is and isn‚Äôt part of the task]

## Expected Output
[Clear success criteria]

## Additional Resources
[Docs, tips, examples]

TL;DR: 6:58 is *very* good for someone who isn't specifically training as a rower. For someone who is it's good, but not great. It's a solid D2 time.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">[When Compilers Were the 'AI' That Scared Programmers](https://vivekhaldar.com/articles/when-compilers-were-the--ai--that-scared-programmers/)

&gt;One of the most frequent arguments against compilers was that compiled code could not be as efficient or compact as handwritten assembly. People would say they could be more efficient in assembly, giving a whole litany of reasons to avoid high-level languages. And this was not entirely untrue. The earliest compilers sometimes did produce verbose or suboptimal machine language. A 1965 Honeywell management briefing noted candidly that a highly skilled assembly programmer could still beat COBOL‚Äôs output in efficiency. But it also questioned how many highly skilled programmers are available or even needed at the average installation.

...

&gt;There was an implicit fear that making programming easier might reduce the prestige or necessity of the seasoned programmer. High-level languages opened the door for newcomers to write code without years of experience in binary or assembly. The priesthood culture, Bacchus described, suggests that some experts guarded this domain closely.

&gt;Grace Hopper encountered this attitude when promoting compilers. Management and colleagues initially thought the idea of automatic programming was crazy, fearing it would make programmers obsolete. Hopper and others had to repeatedly demonstrate that these tools would augment programmers‚Äô productivity, not replace the need for skilled people.

The way I see it: I've noticed two things have happened over the past 20 years in programming/coding:

1. Software development has become easier than ever
2. Software development has become more complex than ever

I imagine it's going to be the same thing here, which is why everyone is having a hard time predicting the future with it. We look back now and see what happened: coding become more accessible, more capable, and (most importantly)¬†*more complex*.

I know AI is "different", but some are arguing...[how different](https://ben11kehoe.medium.com/the-end-of-programming-will-look-a-lot-like-programming-8b877c8efef8)? I am already starting to see that these tools are enabling more complexity to take shape, where software itself is going to increase in complexity in terms of the problems it can solve. This means we'll be pushing these systems to their limits, and needing highly technically oriented and skilled individuals to work with these systems that keep growing in complexity (and lots of them).

Hell, I just watched a YouTube of a developer who was orchestrating an MCP with Claude Code and integrating with Cursor along with TaskMaster and Gemini 2.5. It was¬†*so much more complex*¬†than any development workflow I've seen to date. In other words, we're not going to take the techie out of the tech industry, and there will never be a shortage of needs and desires from the public.

Yes, there will be shifts, there always are; you don't need a programmer any longer to create simple websites (Wix, SquareSpace, Webflow) or even simple applications (Airtable, Bubble.io), but there's still more work than ever to go around, with a backlog that has only grown by leaps and bounds.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I've seen this comparison being thrown a lot ("it's happened before"), but frankly no matter how you frame it, it's not the same. Compilers were a predictable, higher level abstraction that produced repeatable results. AI isn't that.¬†


In fact, hallucinations and performance degradation worsening as the scale of application grows are the biggest hurdles it needs to overcome. Challenges which are seeing farther and farther away as recent AI advancements keep getting smaller and smaller than the exponential leaps we were used to.


Anyways, I agree there's too much doom posting going around, but I personally find claims like "this has happened before" trying to normalize AI like it completely replaced programming to be just as harmful.


I wish there was more nuance to this conversation than people trying to either a) sell the idea AI makes coding ability importan or b) pretend relying on AI is the biggest sin imaginable. Like there is no in-between</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is certainly a concern. But also imagine what innovations humans cook up to resist and fight back against such waves.

The problem is that bots are abundant and automatic, littering every square inch of the internet. But again... that just raises the anticipation of what sort of innovations will be experimented with against that.

We're already bleeding into human IDs, at least with World (Sama's eye orb company). It's a matter of time before platforms finally drop the gate and require such IDs in order to post. So, there's a pathway in our future where all bots get blocked at that gate.

Granted, this probably won't fix the problem. Why not let me sign in, and then I activate my bots? They may be throttled by too much activity, so I may have to slow it waaaaaay down, but I can still go to bed while it posts at a human-rate.

Still bad, sure. But dozens of orders of magnitudes better than how bad it's getting and can get.

Mr Rogers said look for the helpers. But I'm antsy to look for the innovators.

I swear to god I've always talked like this even before LLMs stole my cadence. Which I only mention because I'm looking over my comment and thinking *"why do I kinda sound like a bot, fuck."*</div>

I understand ‚Äúhow‚Äù to code (studied computing in the 90s‚Ä¶ used BASIC and some C) but I don‚Äôt know much about current languages and standards etc. 

But‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm still coding pretty complex stuff through ‚Äúnatural language programming‚Äù. And I‚Äôm picking it up as I go. Like language immersion. 

It really is a massive game changer for someone like me who knows theory and roughly how to structure stuff etc but doesn‚Äôt (well, *didn‚Äôt*) actually know any current languages. 

I imagine it‚Äôs highly useful for someone who knows one language but wants/needs to use another they never learned. You just pick it up as you go. 

And as the tools get better the knowledge necessary to use them is going to continue to decrease.</div>

At the same time, the market was still growing ‚Äî computers were being sold, and the world hadn't yet reached saturation.

Today, however, the world is saturated with computers, and the market has stopped expanding.

There has been a lot of capital in crypto, and it was basically a tool to short people. I think the usefulness seem to be much better argument. The fact that so many people use the AI for so many things just would indicate that it's here to stay. Rarely do we have a piece of technology that we just go back to. Just another similar one appears. After MySpace died, it's not like we went back to interacting in real life. We got Facebook and other social media. Yahoo turned into Google, Uber Eats turned into Door Dash. Even if all the current AI companies will die, there will be another companies that will take their place.

                                <div class="reply-body">You've completely misunderstood.  Bostrom has written extensively about the threat from AI and did so years before 95% of the people in the thread ever looked at the tech.  He's not saying "we're not there", he's saying the threat of us being there is a lot greater now and there are no clear barriers to ASI happening.  

It's not a prediction that ASI is coming in two years, it's a statement that *there is less reason to believe that it cannot happen* in the coming two years.</div>
