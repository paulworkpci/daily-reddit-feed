There are barely any major articles written about it. I've noticed how similar the altered states of consciousness and loss of ego can be to the effects of psychedelics. It's considered common sense (or at least it should be) to avoid psychedelics—and any hallucinogens, for that matter—if you're predisposed to such ment...</div>

It does interest me how the two are similar, as well as those who have a knock you on your ass spiritual experience that creates a state of psychosis- like symptoms often referred to as "spiritual psychosis ".

But it doesn't appear to be as delusional or dangerous,  but it is interesting that it seems to affect people like that. 

To reach a psychadelic- like state seems to take a lot of practice/ deep meditation,  so it probably isn't quite as dangerous as a psychadelic that just rockets you to another state of consciousness, but people still need to be aware.</div>

You basically have to center your life around meditation for years.

There are quite a few people - particularly young men - using all sorts of drugs, then doing meditation, and then getting pretty spaced out. It's not as uncommon as it sounds. And it is not the same sort of issue as e.g. navigating the dukkha nanas in vipassana.</div>

I recommend asking them if they have a wishlist somewhere so you know by the time you’re ready to buy something, it’s up to date. 

(Also, I’d rather be excited about getting something I want than the “surprise” of getting a trinket I don’t need but am stuck keeping because gift. Talking to you mom.)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Why does the statement "we have begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves" need to be qualified with "begun to see glimpses". Are they improving themselves or not? If they are: Why are we beginning to see glimpses? If they *are* improving themselves, then the correct statement is: "We have observed our AI systems improving themselves."

The reason why you qualify a statement like that is so you can walk it back and not be called a liar. Plain and simple.</div>

Yearly price increases, making the CVT mandatory, and now removing the base trim will do that.

Despite what this subreddit thinks, it seems like people don't like not having things like push button start as Subaru has pretty much killed off every single trim that still offered keyed ignitions.</div>

Subaru has now killed the base model for all of their non SUV/crossover models.

The Impreza, WRX, and BRZ all no longer have a base model for 2026, along with the Legacy being killed off.

For the Impreza it starts at the Impreza Sport, for the BRZ it starts at the BRZ Premium, and for the WRX it starts at the WRX Premium.</div>

The popular opinion seems to be that companies nerf the models after all the benchmarks have been run and all the PR around how great the models are has been done.  I'm still 50/50 on if I believe this.  As my codebases get larger and  more complicated obviously agents should perform worse on them and this might explain a large chunk of the degraded performance. 

However, this week I hit a new low. I was so unproductive ...</div>

I haven't found a source for "For the first time ever," though.

Worth noting: His brother *was* in the office and did die.

Also, [this man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Lutnick) is Howard Lutnick and he isn't in the "shadows" or "staying quiet". He's literally the current U.S. Secretary of Commerce and was a well-known fundraiser for Trump's 2020 and 2024 campaigns.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not sure if it was first time ever. His son's first day of senior school is all I could find in a BBC article from 2006

"Howard Lutnick, Cantor's chairman and chief executive, survived only because he arrived at work later than normal, having taken his son to his first day in senior school."

[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5282060.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5282060.stm)

edit the article says senior school but seems his oldest son was born in 1996, so 5 at the time. That really could be his first day of school.

Its those dramatic extra details that turn people off of conspiracies, as well as what debunkers like to use to invalidate your whole argument.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You're not wrong, but the video cuts way short. It put the hamper in front of the door. Will it attempt to remove it before closing the door? Will it even close the door? What about adding detergent? Can it remember what settings we want? What about actually pressing the buttons? What even prompted it to "autonomously" do the laundry? Is it able to go back and check on its own after setting an internal timer? What about dealing with the clothes after? So many things that aren't answered and everyone is eating up this video. I'm a huge proponent for technology, but what's the difference between what I saw and an "autonomous" assembly arm that gets everything prompted to it besides the ability to walk around?

Just like ChatGPT and the likes, this will only improve, but I hate how the guy was acting like it was already doing everything on its own when the video was clearly cut short because it was about to stand there doing nothing.</div>

They just managed to get a high ranking in search results by gaming the engine with search engine optimization. There are so few legitimate third party websites written by expert humans with a unique opinion. In the past, there were high quality results, but not anymore. Over the last decade, most search results have become mostly garbage. So an AI overview is going to save time, and most of the time it will be at least as good as the bad search results surfaced by the average web search, even if it hallucinates a little bit</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A lot of conservatives are saying this. Through all of the articles since January about Trump voters regretting their choice, I've never once encountered it in the real world. Never. 

But I have now heard a lot of them say this Epstein stuff is bullshit. They STILL haven't said they regret voting for him, but they are pissed about this.

That said, I still don't believe they, or Joe, will actually admit their stupidity when it finally does come out that Trump was fully aware of what was going on and was involved.

If they admit this, if they admit the other side was right all along, that the guy they wrapped their entire personality up with is a rapist and a pedo, where does that leave them? How do they look themselves in the mirror? Most of them won't be able to face that, so they'll believe whatever trump says, even if it's "Biden and the Democrats have a time machine and went back in time to make those phone calls from Epstein's house, and write Trump's name in those books."

They literally already believed it when they were told Democrats manipulated the weather to fuck over Florida and North Carolina.</div>

The conservative sub was flush with disapproval over this until the mods tried to damage control it by making a megathread that only defaulted to New. Then their karma-farming superposters started trying to distract by blowing up their feed with nonstop articles and calling anti-Trump conservatives secret liberals in disguise.

My favorite is when the rare "Trump did something objectively stupid" article slips in there and they still find a way to blame democrats for it????</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is obviously relevant to the sub because Joe is obsessed with Congressional stock trading when corruption in politics is discussed. Several prominent Republicans have come out in favor of the bill, as have most Democrats, but the disaster for Trump is that even Nancy Pelosi is backing the bill. That's why Trump is so furiously attacking Hawley, he gave even Pelosi the upper hand on him in this debate.</div>

I’m obviously simplifying this but maybe the bill says “congresspersons are not allowed to trade stocks”.

well, yes, but creating images (let alone video) from prompts was considered black magic just a few years ago, and now Veo 3 is churning out viral clips that get millions of views.

if you're in the business of creating content, it's kind of obvious where this is heading.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">We've been increasingly isolating ourselves in cultivated bubbles of self interest in all facets of life, including entertainment. 

Fandoms will increasingly desire *not sharing* what they like with the masses, as that simply invites all the vitriol and nitpicking that we currently see trending. If you enjoyed the recent season of Last of Us for example, you weren't exactly able to share that enjoyment with others online. 

Add to this the 'ownership' feeling that will come from sharing 'your' creation with a small group of likeminded people and we'll see the death of entertainment for the masses within our lifetimes.</div>
