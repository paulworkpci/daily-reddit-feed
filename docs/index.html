Buddy, someone posts this exact same “revolutionary breakthrough” idea every single week. For the past year. 
Almost always marketed using an LLM to snazz up the language and almost always they’ve released it because they believe the cock-sucking back-patting effusively complimentary bullshit praise heaped on them from the LLM. 

LLMs are designed to make you think your idea is revolutionary. Brilliant. Important. 

Here a hint:  it’s none of these.</div>

Even factoring in that it's more likely the people they're dealing with could be armed than it is my country, they seem so over the top and aggressive in their interactions with the public.


Edit: for reference, I'm Irish and have seen a lot of riots being dealt with in Northern Ireland. I don't think the modern NI police gets anywhere near as randomly agro with the general public as the police in the US and like, that's a former conflict zone where things can really kick off </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">In college I was involved in an incident that resulted in tear gas being used on a crowd.





The incident, a World Series win.  At 10:00+ on a Wednesday night in a small college town, a couple hundred students poured out on Main St in celebration and then when the police showed up instead of directing the small amount of late night traffic around the tiny bit of the road where the kids where and managing the crowd they just started deploying tear gas on a crowd and it became a shit show.





And I definitely know it was police being unable to make any sort of reasonable decision because the next time there was a title game they were able to do exactly what I just said.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is great. If you know how latent space works within LLMs and transformers, then you know, from observation and output, that certain concepts and words and meanings are grouped together, intrinsically. 

This is just additional rigorous proof of that being the case, and kind of how that occurs. 

(Sidenote: *this* is actually **the concept** that made me theorize that LLMs, transformers, image gen models, etc. are closer to  parts of the human brain, like the hippocampus / the visual cortex, than people would otherwise think. 

e.g. Object-concept relations in diffusion-based image-gen models being similar to the visual form constants elucidated by psychedelic research, i.e. visual heuristics used by the brain to process sensory data on a constant basis.

                        <div class="comment-body">For me, full o3 was blowing my mind for a while but recently I've realized how much it hallucinates and that's become a big problem. I doubt o3-pro solves it. I have in my custom instructions for ChatGPT to *always* cite sources when making a claim, including a direct quote, because I hoped this would cut down on hallucinations, but it doesn't. I am often querying about medical things, and it will very often simply make up numbers or a direct quote that doesn't exist.

One example is I was asking about the number of prescriptions for a certain drug recently. It *told* me that it went to an FDA website and made some queries, but the URLs it gave me for the queries returned 404s and the numbers ended up being wrong. It literally just made them up.</div>

But when it comes to o1 and o1-pro, the main thing that shocked me with o1-pro was its lack of hallucinations and its firm command of its own inner-knowledge. I posted about this before about how I could ask about some obscure exchange between academics, and only o1-pro could tell me who/what/when/where down to the correct date, name of publisher, etc, while the other versions simply denied any such exchange even existed.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Full-time staff are paid around 55k a year on salary. 12-16 coaching hours a week, plus office work and limited janitorial duties. The expected workload is 30 hours a week total. Private training is set by each coach, 70/30 split in their favor, unless they're following in-house programming, in which case 60/40. Unlimited PTO, no one abuses it, and it shakes out to about 3 weeks of vacation a year per full time coach. I forget the continuing education budget, but I think it's 50% match, up to 1k a year. Free membership, plus a free membership for one other person, this is usually spouses or significant others, but doesn't need to be. No health insurance, sadly, we can't afford it as a business.

Part time coaches are at $25 an hour with no PTO, no office duties, light janitorial tasks (ie empty the trash at the end of your shift, take out the trash if you're closing on Wednesday), paid to arrive 15 minutes before classes to open, and stay 15 minutes after to close.

All events and staff meetings are paid by the hour at regular rates.</div>

Makes me wonder if this deal was required for them to serve GPT-5 (expected in July) at the scale they expect the demand to rise to. Which then makes me wonder about GPT-5’s capabilities. 

For gods sake PLEASE give us something good, I’m gonna go crazy if they open up with “+2.78% on SWE-bench!! Barely better than Gemini 2.5 Pro! Only available on the ChatGPT Fuck You™ tier, $500/month!”</div>

After all, AI Search is extremely expensive compared to Traditional Search. And OpenAI clearly is compute constrained.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-openai-taps-google-unprecedented-134814771.html

supply additional computing capacity to OpenAI's existing infrastructure for training and running its AI models, sources said, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters. The move also comes as OpenAI's ChatGPT poses the biggest threat to Google's dominant search business in years, with Google executives recently saying that the AI race may not be winner-take-all.

OpenAI, Google and Microsoft declined to comment.

The partnership with Google is the latest of several maneuvers made by OpenAI to reduce its dependency on Microsoft, whose Azure cloud service had served as the ChatGPT maker's exclusive data center infrastructure provider until January. Google and OpenAI discussed an arrangement for months but were previously blocked from signing a deal due to OpenAI's lock-in with Microsoft, a source told Reuters. Microsoft and OpenAI are also in negotiations to revise the terms of their multibillion-dollar investment, including the future equity stake Microsoft will hold in OpenAI.

For Google, the deal comes as the tech giant is expanding external availability of its in-house chip known as tensor processing units, or TPUs, which were historically reserved for internal use. That helped Google win customers including Big Tech player Apple (AAPL) as well as startups like Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) and Safe Superintelligence, two OpenAI competitors launched by former OpenAI leaders.

Google's addition of OpenAI to its customer list shows how the tech giant has capitalized on its in-house AI technology from hardware to software to accelerate the growth of its cloud business.

Google Cloud, whose $43 billion of sales comprised 12% of Alphabet's 2024 revenue, has positioned itself as a neutral arbiter of computing resources in an effort to outflank Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft as the cloud provider of choice for a rising legion of AI startups whose heavy infrastructure demands generate costly bills.

Selling computing power reduces Google's own supply of chips while bolstering capacity-constrained rivals. The OpenAI deal will further complicate how Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai allocates the capacity between the competing interests of Google's enterprise and consumer business segments.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">That’s fantastic that you’ve found the key to reaching that mental state.  There’s all kinds of books and videos and articles out there that try to teach this,  but now I’m sure you see that you’ve really got to cross that threshold yourself to truly understand it.  And once you do, you’ve essentially proven to yourself that it’s possible to let go.  You’ve found the key.

I believe that we’re all different and the lesson has to come in the right form for each of us.  For example, you hear a lot of references to Buddhism about freeing yourself from desire, but that never really clicked with me personally.  I didn’t understand the word desire. I didn’t get it because I didn’t feel like I was really desiring anything.  But what did click with me was the concept of not having any expectations.  With no expectations about life, you can’t be sad, angry, frustrated, jealous, worried, etc etc.  Each moment just is what it is, there to be gratefully experienced.

Also as someone whose brain is often swimming with the need to stay on top of responsibilities and always plan for the future, I can tell you that one thing that serves to immediately deflate all of that for me is this:  I simply stop right where I am and tell myself “I have no better place to be than here right now.”  Anyway, that’s just a trick that I’ve found to shift me out of my own anxiety.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I honestly still think actual physics and rendering engines are going to be the way to get consistent characters and scenes going forward. Using an actual rendering guarantees physical consistency. The AI can design the mesh / model itself and animate it using rigging and such, but the actual rendering will be deterministic.

Even the top tier image models don’t make consistent celebrity pics and those are images that it’s gotta have seen thousands and thousands of selfies of the same person. I am really not convinced video models will have character consistency.</div>

### 🔌 **Provider Updates**
*   **OpenRouter Latency**: We've replaced explicit caching with implicit caching for Gemini models via OpenRouter to significantly reduce latency.

### ⭐ **QOL Improvements**

And if you could make it more clear in the history tab what is sub task, and what is main task.

It reminded me of that hilarious headline from The Register:

“Millions forced to use brain as OpenAI’s ChatGPT takes morning off.”
Still gold.

I’ve seen the memes flying brain meltdown cartoons, jokes about having to “Google like it’s 2010,” and even a few desperate calls to Bing. Honestly, it’s kind of amazing (and a little terrifying) how quickly AI became a daily habit for s...</div>

So you have a rules file to tell code assist what to do for each prompt.

The script just says prompt input: &lt;what I type&gt;. 

So you type in a prompt. 
It returns something. 
Next you type in the prompt to run the python script.
Now with script running in terminal, you type your follow up prompts in the terminal window?  
And you just continue there until you’re done?

So then it treats each prompt in the terminal as 1 tool call?

Yeah must be too early in the am for me : )</div>

Let’s say you get 500 requests per month.  
Each request can include up to 25 tool calls.  
So in total, that’s:

👉 500 requests × 25 tool calls = 12,500 tool calls/month

# ❌ The Usual Way 

* You type a message
* AI replies (1 tool call)
* ✅ Done — but that uses up 1 full request
* The rest of the 24 tool calls? Wasted.

# ✅ With This Setup (Full Power)

* You type a message
* AI replies (1 tool call)
* Then it runs a Python script that says: "prompt: "
* You type your next instruction right there in the terminal
* AI does it, and the loop continues...

🔁 This can repeat up to 25 tool calls — all inside 1 single request

# 🛠️ How It Works Behind the Scenes

* After AI finishes your task
* It automatically runs a Python script: [userinput.py](http://userinput.py)
* That script just asks: "prompt: "
* You enter your next instruction in the terminal
* AI sees that, does the work, and repeats the loop

All of this happens without starting a new chat or request — so you're getting 10x more value per request.</div>

At least at the two banks that I've worked at, the check companies charge out the wazoo. I'm talking $40 for 80 regular wallet-style checks with standard non-trackable shipping.

You can get them from Walmart, Costco, Sam's Club, Vistaprint, etc for like $10-$15 for 200 checks. Personalized, negotiable, secure*, and much more affordable.

I hope we will look at the jobs a thousand years in the future and think they are very fake jobs, and I have no doubt they will feel incredibly important and satisfying to the people doing them."

The work the rest of us  are doing is frustrating, poorly paid misery. However 90% of it doesn't need to happen *at all*. Either in hours or headcount.

If we just drew a line in the sand, said "this is what a family should consider a good living" and work toward it collectively we could be shut this shit.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Look, I'm not by any means the biggest fan of Tesla. But depending on the context, this is a completely different level to autonomous driving.

Waymo's entire strategy is to map out a city in extreme depth. Its car service is geofenced by this process, and so while its "better" at autonomous driving in the places it will serve, this limit will always slow them down.

Conversely, Tesla is aiming for more generalizable autonomous driving. Although it has other limitations, camera centric driving once "solved" should allow much broader adoption as it can be enabled throughout the country rather than city by city. There are things to be said about its reliability (esp the lack of LIDAR) and operability in conditions more volatile than Austin, but I think this is a necessary bit of nuance when it comes to analyzing technological progress.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Difficult point. Obviously these subs are mostly used by enthusiasts, but most customers are just wealthy and normally not car guys.

And on top it‘s important to understand these statistics and different pricing strategies. The BMW 5 series here includes ICE, PHEV &amp; BEV while for example mercedes E class is only ICE and PHEV. And on top BMW currently goes for lowest prices and highest volume between the 3 germans while Audi is in the middle and Mercedes is much more expensive aiming for selling less cars but at higher prices for higher margins leading to them actually making more profit than BMW despite lower sales numbers (mercedes made 50% more profit than bmw in 2024). The Audi on the other hand is a totally new model - there sales numbers are always low. 

In Germany for example the i5 currently is insanely cheap especially as a company lease. Like it‘s more expensive to get a skoda octavia or vw passat. This combined with ev tax rebates makes it insanely popular. In my company 50% of the 2024 fleet are i5. This alone will make up a big portion of the numbers here. 

So this statistic basically confirms: The 5 series is doing well in europe, but including bev while competitors are listed ice/phev only and while being cheaper than mercedes and audi equivalents. So nothing Crazy</div>
