So what's the drawback? Has to be one, right? 

Sodium is heavier than lithium. So people had thought that sodium battery chemistry might be constrained to grid scale batteries and stationary systems. 

But these power density figures are comparable to mid level lithium ion. And the cell does not requi...</div>

The weight being the only con, there are lots of pros. Safer, faster charging, cheaper, etc. My LEAF uses a 65KWh LiPo and replacement is $15K. A brief skimming tells me an equivalent Sodium battery would cost about $5K, installed. I would lose about 20% range if the batteries were the same size, but the LEAF only got 240 miles of range already, so it's not for road trips, anyway. It's for going to work and running errands. I have a 2005 Dodge van that gets 20 mpg I use for road trips and moving furniture.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">As a side note, trucks/minivans/vans, especially in the USA which has a higher weight limit, sodium batteries are especially appropriate.  The vehicles are already 6-8k lbs, are body on frame with a ton of space underneath (well minivans aren't BOF but still have a ton of space)

So you pack the cells into an enormous 200-300 kWh pack (this gives the vehicle excellent range and trucks will be able to tow).  A 300 kWh pack is \~4100 lbs.  It lives underneath in otherwise wasted space - the whole bottom of the vehicle is an aluminum plate, then a plastic skid plate to protect it.

Charging can be really fast - a vehicle like this will be able to charge at almost a megawatt.

And most critically, a 200 kWh pack, at $20 a kWh, is only 4k.  (on a 50k-80k vehicle).  They will be cheap, the vehicle itself can sell for less than the ICE vehicle, and it *also* saves you money the first month on fuel, if you can charge at home.</div>

Lasted him well into the 2000’s before he passed and then I drove it for 5 years and we sold it and that guy drove it for another 10.  He finally put it to rest not long ago.  We have gone so far backwards to appease failing big business it’s pathetic.   Yet here we are with them as our shadow govt pulling strings yet again to keep Chinese tech out of USA so that citizens won’t understand just how bad we have it here.</div>

Apparently it takes way too much energy to distill out the last bit of water, so desalination facilities rarely, if ever, produce solid marketable salt as a byproduct. Instead, they end up having to dump or store massive quantities of high concentration salt water. Often this saline solution is dumped back into the ocean, where it causes massive ecological damage.</div>

They have been conditioning everyone since 9/11 to see anyone with the “terrorist” label applied as someone who does not deserve any rights or to be looked at as human. The amount of propaganda has been enormous, and it has been constant.

Clear Bubble Wrap will make a decent multi-pane window out of a drafty single pane. It lets virtually all the natural light in and can be done neatly. 

Not to mention - it is a privacy shield that lets all the light in.

                                <div class="reply-body">many meditate to get away from chaos, its good, but remove the chaos and shit it makes it all easier, i feel like people get lost on this journey and want a quick fix many tell others their issues and the persons response why dont you meditate lol, look, not all people that meditate walk in profound peace or love, so the goal for me personally is to reflect and also when i have time to soar through the cosmos and enjoy the creativity and love my mind has to offer, imaging your eyes are closed and you are looking at a room, only a room you see and put some of your issues on the shelf like picture frames, focus on what you want fixed look at all angles and remove those that serve no purpose and cherish those that do, how could you have reacted better how can you react better moving forward, theres so many things you can do when its you and your mind your just slowing down a bit to think clearly, but i will say walking in health, love and sharing peace helps, dont get mad at the derelict taking to long in the car in front of you wish them peace, live like that and peace will come back to you</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt; honestly meditation didn’t fix my life, fixing my life made meditation possible 

It’s a positive feedback look. More sitting, more awareness of tensions and thought patterns and self-knowledge, more time to envision life things you really need to get done and/or how it will feel to procrastinate those things. Therapy and bodywork is synergistic with meditation because they help you notice and process even more. 

Honestly, meditation makes you more *sensitive* to everything.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Excellent post .. like everything in life if you want good results you need to put some effort into it .. making your meditation room a place that brings a pleasant feeling of calmness and rest that you enjoy returning to is essential .. meditation will in time bring you your most happy and life giving moments , you don’t want to experience those inspiring things in a filthy disorganised place .. our environment does affect our mind

.. and so does looking after your body .. get a shave .. wash your hands .. these things are all suggestions to your subconscious that your meditation period is important and appreciated by you .. .. a good diet .. fresh air .. deep proper breathing .. exercise and sleep .. the old traditions actually start with these fundamentals before moving on to meditation proper ..</div>

**overnight • zero risk • zero effort • world tour included**.  
Completely reasonable. Let’s begin 😌

  
(most of the answers were similar to ones already stated in this thread, so these are my fave)

1. Manifest aggressively.
2. Whisper “abundance” to your bank app.
3. Simply *decide* to be rich.
4. Charge people for your presence.
5. Sell a course titled **“How I Got Rich Overnight”** (step 1: sell the course).
6. Become a silent partner in everything.
7. Do nothing, but confidently.
8. Hire people to do nothing for you.
9. Get paid for having opinions.
10. Get paid for not sharing them.</div>

It's a sad reality but Open AI has managed to forever bond the word "AI" with "CHAT GPT" and 90+% of people think of chat gpt when someone says ai

His priorities are way off. Yes, Grok illegal sex art is horrible, but directly assisting an administration who is actively murdering citizens is far worse. 

Claude will gladly refuse to generate you a sex story because it's "unethical,"  but Claude is eager to assist in ICE raids and missile strikes.</div>

It's a good reason why no company should be interested in generative NSFW. At some point, someone's going to find a way to get around the guardrails, and then the company is going to be raked over the coals about it for years.</div>

it absolutely did show you breasts and with some prompting you could even show vagina and all the sexual acts. you can find all the old posts on r/grok and easily verify this. it's since been restricted heavily (meaning that they could very easily do this but didnt want to).</div>

Thanks to this feature, your phone doesn’t ring when you get spam calls and instead the person calling is screened and has to state their name and purpose of calling and you can then take the call if you accept.

How-to:

Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Phone &gt; Screen Unknown Callers and you can select "Ask Reason for Calling"</div>

At the time I genuinely believed it and was warmed by it but now that trump is on his second terms, these companies who were his staunchest adversaries now decided to get into bed with him. I feel so stupid for defending them back in 2016 when I was arguing with MAGAts that these companies were sincere about their efforts and that it wasnt just a money grab smh.</div>

Most notably in my opinion, apart from the speed up and leverage of running multiple agents in parallel, is the atrophy in one’s own coding ability. I have felt this but I can’t help but feel writing code line by line is much like an artisan carpenter building a chair from raw wood. I’m not denying the fun and the raw skill increase, plus the understanding of each nook and crevice of the chair that is built when doing that....</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;The "no need for IDE anymore" hype and the "agent swarm" hype is imo too much for right now. The models make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them without checking. They also don't manage their confusion, they don't seek clarifications, they don't surface inconsistencies, they don't present tradeoffs, they don't push back when they should, and they are still a little too sycophantic.

As every logical person has been saying.

&gt;I’m just saying if you suddenly had the ability to produce 1000 chairs per hour in a factory, albeit with a little less quality, wouldn’t you stop making them one by one to make the most out your leveraged position?

When you're on the hook for quality (refunds, fixing things, reputation damage), the "quantity over quality" approach becomes less attractive. If producers had to "give money back for every broken chair," you'd probably see more careful, selective use of AI rather than flooding everything with volume.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I can currently ask Claude to fix a bug. Give it the entire codebase. And it has a decent shot at fixing it first go, with a simple fix that I can verify manually. Or ask it to write a feature, and I can see the code it writes, ask for unit tests, and validate everything by hand. Even in areas of the code that I don't understand at all beforehand. I can ask it to explain the design of a part of the code, and it will, and if I manually verify it it turns out to be correct.


I am not currently comfortable allowing Claude to deliver code on my behalf with no checks (edit - assuming it's production code that actually matters - I am comfortable allowing it to write personal scripts and tools that I don't need to verify), but I am comfortable allowing Claude to write code that I then check and verify.

                        <div class="comment-body">This is a programmer-centric perspective on the impact of AI.  Let's step back a bit.

Many programmers work in a larger context, with product managers, user interface designers, data scientists, program managers, salespeople, digital artists, etc.  And, ultimately, there are customers, the people who will use whatever the programmers create.

Here's a question that interests me:  within that larger context, one group of people-- programmers-- are suddenly accelerating by like 10x.  So what are the consequences for the larger ecosystem?

We're going to find out in 2026, and I think it will be... stressful.

For example, when coding something took a year, folks working on artwork, the user interface, product specifications, etc. could reasonably take a few months.  But now programmers can deliver in a week.  So product development time pressure will intensify on people in those other roles:  "PLEASE just pick a UI by the end of \*today\*, so AI can code the application over the weekend, and we can ship the product on Monday..."  What was previously delivered in months will now be demanded in days or hours.

As a special case, how customers deal with acceleration is an open question.  Complex applications have a learning curve, so there is a limit to how fast people can absorb new software.  Some software packages roll out UI changes over years, because coding takes time and customers have to adapt.  But what if that messy UI in Blender (or whatever) could, in principle, be rewritten as fast as it could be designed?  Now customers learning to use the new UI is the bottleneck.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">As a staff level ux designer at a medium-large sized tech co: The answer is that AI needs to and likely will speed up the other disciplines as well. Like the fundamental workflows will need to change and adapt. We will be running user testing on branches of code and in feature flags of production level ready code, instead of rudimentary Figma prototypes. The build, design, validate, and ship cycle will be much more iteratively agile if devs can deliver in days instead of months because the stakes are so much lower. Devs will get a lot more comfortable with throw away code as we throw shit at the wall to see what works. So much our current and past workflows are determined by the high-risk cost associated with a developer spending time on something. With that constraint removed, product and ux should be empowered to move much faster. Devs might be doing some of the design lift, designers might be doing some of the dev lift too. We'll all just be throwing stuff at the wall but being very selective about what experiences we choose to keep.</div>

The reason you need complex and complicated UI and systems is mostly to accomodate a divers customer base. But most customers only ever scratch the surface of any software (looking at you SAP you bloated pile of mess)  
But with LLM supported coding, smaller more custom software that is made either by small contract teams or inhouse can support the "actual" customers way better, because the users don't have to go through 5 layers of support walls until they reach a person that actually cares enough.</div>

We’re a small team of devs from Qoder. With the mods’ permission, we thought it’d be fun (and useful) to do an AMA here.

A few weeks ago,we used our own autonomous agent (Quest) to refactor itself. We described the goal, stepped back, and let it run. It worked through the interaction layer, state management, and the core agent loop continuously, for about 26 hours. We mostly just reviewed the spec at the start and the code at the end. We’ve made good progress, and would ...</div>

2. I'm assuming you had to do a lot of prep before giving the control to the agent? What sort of prep was required? What pre-work did you do?
3. How do you manage context for such a long running and presumably huge context problem statement?
4. How did you test? Did the agent create its own test cases? From what I have seen, most LLMs create test cases in a way to pass the code they have written (usually, and unless handheld to avoid doing this), manipulate the test cases to ensure their code passes etc. How are you avoiding this?

&gt; would like to talk openly about what worked, what broke, and what surprised us.

Well, what did work, what broke and what surprised you?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">yo good question! so honestly the "self-testing" part is less magic than it sounds lol

basically we baked in a habit for the agent to actually *check its own work* after finishing tasks. like, if it just built a webpage, it'll fire up the browser tool and actually click around - does the button work? does the form submit? that kinda thing.

for the refactor run specifically, we had a pretty solid test suite already, so the agent would run tests after each chunk of changes. if something broke, it'd see the red and backtrack. not perfect, but it caught most regressions before they snowballed.

the "verify loop" is honestly one of the things we're most excited about iterating on. right now it's good enough™ but there's def room to make it smarter</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Since this threw me for a loop too I looked it up. Basically they take the model's response, swap out the stop token for something like "Wait", and pass that back into the model for it to re-digest and maybe make corrections to. Rinse and repeat a configurable number of times and you apparently tend to get a better result from a model that's RL trained to expect this process.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Did one quick hallucination/instruction following test (ngl, the only reason why I'd consider this an instruction following test is because Kimi K2 and Grok a few months ago did *not* follow my instructions), asking the model to identify a specific contest problem without websearch (anyone can try this. Copy paste a random math contest question from AOPS and ask the model to identify the exact contest it was from without websearch and nothing else)

Kimi K2 some months ago took forever, because it wasn't following my instruction and started *doing* the math problem, and eventually timed out. 

Kimi K2.5 started listing out contest problems in its reasoning traces, except of course those contest problems are hallucinated and not real (I am curious as to if some of those questions it bullshitted up are doable or good...), and second guesses itself a lot which I suppose is good, but still confidently outputs an incorrect answer (a step up from a few months ago I suppose!)

Gemini 3 for reference *confidently* and I mean *confidently* states an incorrect answer. I know the thinking is summarized but it repeatedly stated that it was *absolutely certain* lmao

GPT 5.1 and 5.2 are the only models to say word for word "I don't know". GPT 5 fails in a similar way to Kimi 2.5. 



I do wish more of the labs try to address hallucinations.

On a side note, the reason why I have this "test" is because last year during the IMO week, I asked this question to o3, and it gave an "I don't know" answer. I repeatedly asked it the same thing and it always gave me a hallucination aside from that single instance and people here found it cool (the mods here removed the threads that contained the comment chains though...) https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1m60tla/alexander_wei_lead_researcher_for_oais_imo_gold/n4g51ig/?context=3</div>
