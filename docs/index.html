The next video models aren't just trained on descriptive text and videos anymore, but with audio as well so that the characters may speak based on our text input, and the things happening in the video like explosion, collision water splashing, etc are producing sound.

It would also be great if we could feed that thing multiple images of characters, clothing or location with associated sounds and voice tone and it would be able to generate something based on those inputs on top of the text prompt.</div>

Something like a character creator to make consistent actors using either prompts or photos/videos of real people. Ways to dress a scene/location that are more granular and offer more control than just prompting. Scene transitions, camera placement, angles and types of motion (dolly, handheld, crane etc), camera lenses, specific lighting placement an types. Basically giving directors and producers the full suite of controls they have when making movies in real life. I mean that has to be what they're doing otherwise someone at Lionsgate is wasting a whole lot of money.</div>

I encountered orbs on December 7th  there is a video on my page showing what it did to my thermal when up close. The orb followed me until December 11th as far as I can tell.

However, as someone else mentioned in a reply to this comment, the phone used doesn't run the newest version of Android. That's a security risk I wouldn't personally take. 

For other security conscious people who would like a FLIR camera that works with their phone, you can buy one on Amazon that plugs into your phone's USB port. They're pretty small. You could keep it in your purse or pocket. Right now Amazon is misbehaving and I can't share the link but I searched "FLIR camera for Android". They also have them for iPhone.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/Solarscars:

---

&gt;Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, has a notable story regarding his encounter with a UFO. In January 1969, while he was in Leary, Georgia, Carter and a group of about ten people reported seeing a bright light in the sky. According to Carter, the light changed colors and seemed to hover before moving away.
&gt;Carter, who was a naval officer at the time, described the experience as intriguing but did not claim it was an alien spacecraft. He later said that he would be willing to testify before Congress about what he saw, emphasizing his belief that the phenomenon should be investigated. Throughout his life, Carter has expressed a keen interest in UFOs and has stated that he believes the government should be more transparent about their investigations into unidentified flying objects.
&gt;Despite his experience, Carter has not confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial life, maintaining a more skeptical view while advocating for openness regarding UFO phenomena.

Just a very quick overview of his story for those unfamiliar. It's sort of corny, but here is a [video](https://youtu.be/aSISgAgdyH0?si=JbsenF4RzjGxXk5e) that explains more. If anyone else has better videos to share, please do. Peace and love everyone. We lost a good one today.

                                <div class="reply-body">To be fair, the SFPD did the same with a French citizen living in San Francisco a number of years ago.

He was found stabbed and dead within in his own apartment, the knife was never found, but the SFPD ruled the death a suicide.

It's only after France sent in their own investigators that the case was officially reopened by the SFPD and now the death is now considered an unsolved homicide. They figured the guy was robbed and stabbed, and then got into his apartment before he collapsed.

As to this being an OpenAI conspiracy. I'm not sure I believe that. Everyone already knows they're using copyrighted materials to train their models. It doesn't take a whistleblower to know any of that.

The most plausible conspiracy (or incentive structure) here is that the SFPD is trying to keep their murder stats down by labeling every unexplained homicide a suicide.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">So the reason why most people hate ai art is because it ignores that art throughout history carried a sense of human communication.

People can look at an art price and ask what is the person trying to convey, what was her mood, why did they create it, admire the effort and skill to create it, put the piece in its historical context, and see it as a piece of history in the future.

Can't really do that with AI art. It loses a lot of these inherent qualities. Now I can't know how much effort went in, now I can't know if the creator gave a shit when creating it (was it a unique piece with a lot of effort or was it the millionth copy of crap produced), why it was created (can just totally lie).

It lacks authenticity, originality, and overall a blight on what was a form of human connection.

Let me put it to you this way. Suppose you had a loan distance girlfriend. She was the girl of your dreams. She sent vids, pics, texts, would call you regularly and so on. This went on for months, years even.

How would you feel if all that turned out to be an LLM? The feelings and statements you made wre all for nothing.


Now some might argue that you still enjoyed it and if there was a bot the ai could be in that resmelbed a human there would be no issue. Most others would disagree.

It's a matter of principle, axiom, that most value authenticity and uniqueness.</div>

It’s plagiarism, it’s lifeless, it’s devoid of culture and history, and most importantly, it’s another field that’s being monopolized and commercialized by private companies that have nothing but profit in their minds. 

AI doesn’t give a SHIT about the art it’s creating. That’s what people have a problem with.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">TL;DR:

Sam Altman on AI’s Rapid Adoption:

• AI is being adopted faster than any other technology. Altman highlighted this in his interview: “People really are using it a lot. I’ve never seen a technology be widely adopted this fast.”

• He notes that tools like ChatGPT are replacing traditional search methods, which he now finds slow and outdated. Instead of using hyperlinks, people, including Altman, are relying on conversational AI for real-time answers: “I still call it ‘search,’ but younger people might say they ‘chatted up’ the information.”

Superintelligence by 2026?

• Altman asked us to consider the pace of scientific progress: “You have to look at the rate of scientific progress.”

• He suggests that rapid advancements could lead to transformative AI systems within the next 18 months. However, while the world will change, human nature will remain resilient: “It won’t change the deep fundamental human drives, but the world in which we exist will change a lot.”

The Role of People in an AI-Driven World:

• Altman’s optimism centers on humanity’s ability to adapt and create value in new ways: “People have an innate desire to create and to be useful to each other, and AI will allow us to amplify our own abilities like never before.”

• He envisions a future of opportunity and growth: “As a society, we will be back in an expanding world, and we can again focus on playing positive-sum games.”

Job Displacement and Future Prosperity:

• Addressing concerns about AI replacing jobs, Altman provides a historical perspective: “Many of the jobs we do today would have looked like trifling wastes of time to people a few hundred years ago, but nobody is looking back at the past, wishing they were a lamplighter.”

• He believes AI will bring unimaginable prosperity, just as technological advances have done in the past: “If we could fast-forward a hundred years from today, the prosperity all around us would feel just as unimaginable.”</div>

Some ideas I have so far are:
Build a morning routine,  
Build an evening routine, 
Get 10,000 steps daily, 
Add more fruits and veggies to my diet, 
Increase water intake, 
Reduce screen time, 
Read daily

Looking for about 5 more to complete the 12 months! </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Note the following part: "Given sufficiently strong AI, *this is not a risk about insufficient material comfort*. Governments could institute UBI with the AI-derived wealth. Even if e.g. only the United States captures AI wealth and the US government does nothing for the world, if you're willing to assume arbitrarily extreme wealth generation from AI, the wealth of the small percentage of wealthy Americans who care about causes outside the US might be enough to end material poverty (if 1% of American billionaire wealth was spent on wealth transfers to foreigners, it would take 16 doublings of American billionaire wealth as expressed in purchasing-power-for-human-needs—a roughly 70,000x increase—before they could afford to give $500k-equivalent to every person on Earth; in a singularity scenario where the economy's doubling time is months, this would not take long)." This actually seems a hopeful scenario, to me.</div>

I also doubt that billionaires will all experience massive wealth accumulation. Inequality will probably grow so much that there will be a few unfathomably rich individuals - essentially the "victor" of the AI race. Billionaires will be closer to subsuharan Africans in wealth than those few people. We'll need to hope that those few people are well-intentioned, which isn't an assumption I'd generally feel comfortable making about human nature - especially when the stakes are so high.

I think that once you start getting to these numbers, the very concept of a nation state will be obsolete. There's going to be a whole new way of organizing civilization that will need to be adapted to this new paradigm.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Why would he assume that every part our "systems" or even "power structure" would stay intact after ASI? Right now, the powerful people rely on our "systems" to give them power. Elon Musk is in a powerful position becase he owns a majority of Tesla, which is recorded though our financial system, which is accepted world wide, which is enforced by the US government. Every layer of our "systems" is technology based now. 

If an ASI can have access to our financial records, identity records and much more, every person on earth is basically equal in terms of power except for raw athletic strenghs. Since an ASI could have control of everything on earth that could be run with electricity, there is no "personal capital" left in the long run post-singularity.

Our systems are more fragile than most people think. You could buy something because there is a trust in the systems. Elon could ask so many people to do what he wants them to do because our monetary system is trusted. 

It is really improbable for an ASI to be aligned with a small group of people in the long run if it's truly intelligent. It's so naive to think that any human plays a significant role post-singularity assuming that ASI is possible.</div>

What makes you think that? There is no objective morality, AI won't magically stand up for the common person. AI will do *exactly* as it is programmed. If the people building it manage to align it, this means it will only reinforce exasperate current power structures.</div>

How can you compare the fake, unwanted, fabricated "facts" generated by LLMs with models specifically designed to predict the structure and interactions of proteins and other molecules? These models generate precise 3D predictions for valid molecular systems based on physical and biological principles. That’s the whole point of the model, and it doesn’t make sense to compare that with LLM hallucinations. The comparison is ridiculous.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; I always struggle a bit with I'm asked about the "hallucination problem" in LLMs. Because, in some sense, hallucination is all LLMs do. They are dream machines.

&gt; We direct their dreams with prompts. The prompts start the dream, and based on the LLM's hazy recollection of its training documents, most of the time the result goes someplace useful.

&gt; It's only when the dreams go into deemed factually incorrect territory that we label it a "hallucination". It looks like a bug, but it's just the LLM doing what it always does.

&gt; —Andrej Karpathy

I agree with Karpathy and the author of this article. I also think we'd be better off using the term "confabulation" to refer to fabricated facts, even at the risk of anthropomorphizing LLMs.

This is just how pattern completion works. Neuroscientist Anil Seth refers to perception as "controlled hallucination" due to the way predictive processing works: we see a world generated on the fly by our minds based on limited sensory data rather than raw reality itself.

It's not ideal, but what words should we use to distinguish between "made up by an internal generative predictive model and seems accurate in some sense" and "made up by an internal generative predictive model but doesn't seem quite right"?

&gt; These models generate precise 3D predictions for valid molecular systems based on physical and biological principles.

Predictions generated based on limited data. Which is the modus operandi of LLMs as well. It's just how the technology works.

The real problem, if there is one, is that we don't really have words to describe these things better.</div>

You don't have to fry your brain with drugs to be creative. Sure it can be part of a responsible non-addict's tool set but it should be basically equivalent of a 5mm flathead screw driver. Which is to say used in very particular instances based on rationale you've already gone into. Otherwise you're basically just getting high which is what I suspect 90% of the people who go down that path are doing. They'll get "high" and their idea will be "what if I painted with my own shit and called it a critique of contemporary office culture?"

But I would agree that making mistakes and figuring out which ones you want to keep is a regular part of people's creative process.</div>

The problem is all of the things that are causing so much dysfunction are so heavily normalized in our society. It's going to take new structures and pathways to help humanity recreate community for a higher purpose and fulfillment. 


The status quo right now is heavily addicted and sedated. We are literally sleep walking into our own demise if something does not change soon.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There is a fabulous movie, George Lucas' first movie called ***THX 1138***.  The film is set in a dystopian future in which the citizens are controlled by androids/AI police and mandatory use of drugs that suppress emotions to keep them compliant. They are told in creepy automated voices that it's all necessary to keep them safe. That's the creepy part, everything is so well-intentioned. We just have your best interest at heart.  

 The plot is about how the main character discovers how he is being manipulated and frees himself.  He has to make the choice between his existing relationships or freedom, the known vs the unknown. He chooses solitude over a dysfunctional society. There doesn't really seem to be an evil group of people that create this society it's just the result of everyone doing their jobs. 

At the very end of the movie he makes it out of the underground world, great chase scene,  and crawls up to the surface where he experiences nature and the light of the sun for the first time.

This movie was written in....1971</div>

I've tried to stay away from alarmist thinking that all hope is lost but there's something seriously wrong with the way we connect on a human to human level in 2024. Everyone's reactionary and getting more irritable (myself included). It's never been so easy and so difficult at once to connect to other people, everyone and everything's online and companies have made sure we can't stop surfing even if we wanted to. 

I deleted Instagram and stayed off for years until jobs required it in my field. If I wanted to keep up with news and technology then I needed to keep up with social media. Not to mention family I've known my whole life stopped communicating with each other about important things because they "posted about it on IG" and expected us to see it there including funerals and deaths. Some piece of shit "friend" of my mom's cousin was on Facebook last year posting minute by minute status updates about him as he passed away before family was notified and he tagged his account publicly too. Anyone that doesn't benefit their curated algorithmic lifestyle might as well not exist at all.</div>

However, when I regularly put this level of effort into projects I enjoy and then get assigned a task that doesn’t interest me, I struggle to begin it at all and risk being seen as lazy or underperforming because I set the bar too high.

Edit: if people in my life don’t know or understand what ADHD is, I can’t for the life of me explain it in a linear way because ADHD. I send them [this](https://youtu.be/ouZrZa5pLXk?si=s2tLlhaFnak3LwHB) video, and if they care enough about me they’d watch it.

Edit again: Pasting my comment that's deeper into this thread 

&gt;It should be a crime that the video is nearly 30 minutes long for people who potentially have ADHD and are seeking help, but it explains it the best. Took me 6 months to start watching it after someone sent it to me (ADHD - I’ll get to it when shit hits the fan okay? 😂), had to watch it 3 times and it won’t be my last.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I wish people understood that ADHD doesn’t just affect your ability to focus. It really needs to be renamed. ADHD changes your brain chemistry and the way that different parts of the brain communicate with each other, which means that it has a TON of symptoms that affect every part of our daily lives. 

We have trouble with executive function, which means that no matter how hard we may want to do something, we may not be able to force ourselves to do it.

We struggle with motivation because every task is high priority, yet our brains don’t reward us for completing them.

We have sensory issues because we cannot control which things to pay attention to and which things to block out. Some of us, like me, are not capable of blocking anything out unless we’re hyper focused, in which case I will sometimes literally forget to breathe.

We have auditory processing issues, and I couldn’t tell you why. As far as I know, it’s just to make our lives harder. On the bad days, speech has no meaning, it’s just sound. It’s like the adults talking in Peanuts cartoons. We want to listen, but it’s just noise.

We have trouble regulating our emotions. It’s different for everyone, but for me, emotions are either unbearably intense or nonexistent and there is no middle ground. 

There’s so much going on for us at any given moment that it’s no wonder we can’t pay attention. It’s exhausting. It’s not cute or funny, even though we do enjoy poking fun at ourselves. I don’t think it’s much of a stretch to say that most of us would give anything to have our brains function normally.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Plus the memory issues. It's so frustrating to get up to do a thing and then end up in a loop because I forgot what I was doing in the middle of doing it so I have to circle back around trying things to shake loose the memory of what I was doing in the first place. 

The memory issues combined with the auditory processing issues plus being embarrassed about the whole thing, means I often miss conversations or key info or completely forget that conversations happened. Having to ask someone to repeat themselves sucks. Usually they get super upset saying I'm disrespectful and obviously don't care if I can't pay attention to what they're saying. 

I'm sorry my brain decided to scramble the noises coming out of your mouth and then decided to not absorb the info because it wasn't getting a dopamine hit. I'm literally struggling my best to pay attention and make sense of what's going on and I'm genuinely confused and frustrated with the situation too. It makes school so damn hard because teachers will get pissy and then say you should have been paying attention. Thank goodness my college has accommodations for the auditory issues and lets me record all my lectures. They gave me a Glean account for my online classes so I can record those easily too.</div>

I hate having decisions put on me. I make decisions all day long about everything I do. I don't want to come home and get bombarded with more decisions. My wife is pretty fantastic and understanding with everything you listed but as soon as I get home from work: What should we have for dinner? Should we go/order out? From where? What are we doing this weekend? What do you want to watch? Should I... Can we... What about...

The social accountability is really what makes the difference. Ever since I had to move back to my tiny home town and really miss my friends, I just spend all day on the internet. I know I should find some hobbies to make new friends or at least spend some time outside (touch grass, literally) but it's just so much more cosy and convenient to curl up in bed and scroll.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">i think that's a good point. it's definitely a symptom because scrolling can  be a band-aid solution for boredom, loneliness, or depression. coincidentally, i also moved back home recently. it's hard to re-establish a new routine, especially without my old friends. which is why i completely relate when you say:

&gt;I know I should find some hobbies to make new friends or at least spend some time outside (touch grass, literally) but it's just so much more cosy and convenient to curl up in bed and scroll.

those are things i want to do too, like spend time outside or join a hobby/club to make new friends. i recognize i don't want to be lonely. i thought about this further and i think it might be about the feeling of control; we can't control what happens outside in the world beyond our bed. we could join a club or a new hobby, but what happens if it doesn't work out? that's wasted time and effort. at least in our rooms and on our phones, we can control what happens.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">My poison is Google! I have deleted all social media apps and very intermittently use Reddit. But I can’t keep myself from Googling every single question that pops through my head and this sends me down a rabbit hole. It doesn’t help that Google now condenses the information from a few different articles into a couple of paragraphs at the top of the search results. It makes it even more satisfying because it’s like quick bites of info that easily satisfy my curiosity and, at the same time, keeps me coming back. It makes for really shallow thinking as well because we’re not reading the full articles and getting all the nuances. Sigh. Technology is fucking us up.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">yes, google too! i don't hear enough people on this subreddit talk about it compared to, say, instagram or tiktok. i'm addicted to scrolling google news and going down the rabbit hole. google news compiles all the sites reporting on one news story so i can just click every link and read all the reports on a story. and google news also shows you local stories in your location and also based on your interests. it's crazy! i'll just waste an hour there and i'll justify it to myself like, this is just how i keep myself updated and in the know as a responsible citizen/adult. i've tried limiting my access by just sticking to one neutral news source or only reading the newspaper from the news stand when i'm checking out at the store lol.

the itch to google the thing on the top of your mind is really distracting and terrible for your focus throughout the day. maybe what you can do instead of getting distracted by google searching is keeping a small pocket notebook (they're like $3 at the drugstore) and just jotting down the questions that pop into your head. at the end of the day you can let yourself look at the list and look them up. you could even find that you have already forgotten some of them and they weren't that important - just impulses.</div>

But, I always find something interesting that makes me believe I'm learning or becoming smarter in the world. I wonder if it's ultimately procrastination and fear of not being good enough - meaning, I have projects I want to do but I subconsciously think I have to be smarter in order to succeed. I have to be more knowledgeable before I can start, which is of course bullshit.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">yeah! me, too. i love learning and feeling smart. one of my friends (who is on the internet way less) calls me her encyclopedia friend because i sometimes have just a wealth of random facts to share. she jokes that she doesn't need to ask google if she can just ask me. it makes me feel smart in the moment but it's all just internet crap, not very deep. real intelligence would perhaps better come from sitting down and tucking into a real book or peer-reviewed literature.

i think the procrastination (and also perfectionism) part is a huge deal. for instance, before i start a project, i always look up all the steps and then get into a rabbit hole of information and anticipating everything that could go wrong... instead of actually doing it. i wonder if it does have to do with the subconscious feeling of needing to know everything before you start. from the great inventors and scientists of the past, doesn't real wisdom come from making mistakes over and over again? isn't failure the strongest teacher? i think we try to overprepare and save ourselves the trouble and wasted time and disappointment (and money spent) but we have to get comfortable with failure.</div>

Stop with the bootlicking, guys.  They don't need defending.  You can just take the candy and keep being excited about AI without supporting these corps.

But also, these threads are likely filled with bots.  The Google one the other day too.</div>

The idea that openAI is so powerful that they also have control over the police AND the district attorneys office of the area where the dude killed himself in order to make them keep their lips shut is already insane. Then on top of that to suggest that OpenAI is so fucking stupid as to assassinate this guy when his whistleblowing isn’t even insane and barely matters in the grand scheme of things is also insane. And if OpenAI is in the business of killing people, why a barely meaningful whistleblower and not top AI scientists at other labs or anybody else of actual consequence.</div>

Rogan is undeniably skilled at engaging audiences, but that doesn't mean his opinions on complex issues carry the same weight as experts in those fields. 
It’s a reminder that critical thinking is crucial when consuming any media, especially from entertainers stepping into political commentary.</div>
