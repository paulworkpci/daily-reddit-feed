LLMs do not connect symbols to sensory or experiential reality. Their semantic grasp comes from statistical patterns, not grounded understanding. So they can’t “think” in the human sense. Their reasoning is synthetic, not causal.

But they do reason.

LLMs aren’t mere mirrors, mimics, or aggregators. They don’t regurgitate data, they model latent structures in language that often encode causality and logic indirectly.

While not reasoning in the symbolic or embodied sense, they can still produce outputs that yield *functional reasoning*.

Their usefulness depends on reasoning accuracy. You have to understand how probabilistic models gain reliability. As accuracy rises above 50%, repeated runs compound certainty, yielding results that approximate exponential accuracy.

Hallucinations stem from insufficient reasoning accuracy, but that threshold *is* narrowing. LLMs *are* approaching fundamentally sound reasoning, soon they *will* rival deterministic calculators in functional accuracy, except applied to judgment rather than arithmetic. Mark my words. My bet is on 3 years until we all have perfect-reasoning calculator companions.</div>

Also using chatGPT for therapy is dangerous because it will agree with YOU. Me and my friend were having a pretty serious argument, like actually relationship ending. But for fun, during it, we were putting the convo and our perspectives into ChatGPT the whole time and sharing them. Surprise surprise, our ChatGPTs were overwhelmingly on our own sides. I could literally convince it over and over to try and be fair and it would be like "I AM BEING FAIR, SHES A BITCH" (paraphrasing)

So at the end of the day, it hallucinates and it agrees overwhelmingly with you in face of any attempts go get it to do otherwise.</div>

I’ve had friends before do nothing but vent about their partners and then get pissed off that I (and others) don’t like them much - because they don’t realise they never tell us the good stuff. 

It’s not necessarily a bad thing, but something to reflect on if it’s happening often.</div>

Nice, can’t wait to see how AI will eventually do the whole “Oh I found stuff you guys missed” thing in every field of science. This is pretty minor since it just found a few studies they missed, but it’s going to be wild to see how AGI/ASI figures out fundamental laws of the universe that we humans somehow glossed over (or had completely incorrect explanations for)

It’s crazy to think that in the future, we might look at our current scientific knowledge in the same way we now look at the Ancient Greek humoral theory and laugh at bloodletting/trepanning and how primitive of an understanding they must have had (not to discount everything the Ancient Greeks got right though)</div>

The design of puzzles is quite interesting: no symbols, language, trivia or cultural knowledge, and must focus on: basic math (like counting from 0 to 10), basic geometry, agentness and objectness. 

120 games should be coming by Q1 2026. The point of course is to make them very different from each other in order to measure how Chollet defines intelligence (skill acquisition efficiency) across a large number of different tasks.

And we have a bunch of benchmarks trying to calculate real world efficiency. Why people have a problem with just 1 guy trying to bring something else to the table, while also providing a pretty good money prize as motivation?</div>

&gt;**A few additional notes/limitations about SEAL after seeing some reactions:**  
**- This is \*\*not\*\* AGI / recursive self-improvement. It's more towards LLMs ingesting data in a more effective way. We will need more breakthroughs to overcome the core challenges of generalization, hallucination, and continual learning**  
**- We chose the relatively simply no-context SQuAD setup (short passage and questions) so our base model (Qwen2.5-7B) could fully "understand" the content when it was in-context and respond with a large amount of text compared to the original passage. It would be very cool to see how SEAL scales with model size and task complexity.**  
**- Many people are finding our idea of putting self-editing in an RL loop extremely compelling (and we agree!). As a bit of a warning though, RL is not a magic wand that pushes the reward to 1 in any environment. Weight updates from minimal data can be quite brittle and hard to work with, and it's possible self-edits of the form we study are upper bounded in ability to effectively update the model.**  
**- Thanks for all the excitement! We hope this inspires more interesting research!**

A lot of the initial excitement came from misleadingly worded titles saying SEAL had achieved 72% on ARC-AGI rather than 72% on \~18 example problems selected for simplicity.</div>

So of course we say Los Angeles and he goes

"Beautiful city to visit but I can't stand the politics, how do you feel about it."

And my normally quiet gf looks up and goes "I love it and I wouldn't live anywhere else.."

Dude then proceeded to try and start a political conversation so he could shit on LA and we just ignored him.

Like bro, you're in the most beautiful place in the US, relaxing in a hot tub... and you want to shit on "Commie LA" to pass the time?

If protestors were really clashing with the national guard or if a marine really has to raise a rifle at a protestor, that would be televised worldwide live like Jan 6th.

                <div class="post-content">Hey everyone, Nick from Cline here. The Devin team just published a really thoughtful blog post about multi-agent systems (https://cognition.ai/blog/dont-build-multi-agents) that's sparked some interesting conversations on our team.

Their core argument is interesting -- when you fragment context across multiple agents, you inevitably get conflicting decisions and compounding errors. It's like having multiple developers work on the same feature without any communication. There's been this prevai...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree with the Devin team. In any AI agent system—not just code agents—it’s very difficult to keep consistency among subagents. However, if the subtasks are well defined and isolated, with clear specifications and documentation, a multiagent system can still work, much like a software team lead assigning subtasks to each developer.</div>

As the models get better does this become optimal?

And I wonder if multiagent is really the approach to efficiency when you could accomplish time savings by running multiple single threaded agents in parallel on very different tasks.</div>

I’d also track indexes related to robotics and data centers 
I also think that AI combined with quantum will take us to ASI.. so maybe something about that 
Nuclear energy is a great one too and maybe you can add relevant articles or papers as well

I assume this is going to be the C8 Zora, one of the worst kept automotive secrets up to this point with several of them being spotted on tracks already.

For a matter of fact it's not possible for anybody to really comprehend what happens when you do next-token-prediction using backpropagation with gradient descent through a huge amount of data with a huge DNN using the transformer architecture. 

Nonetheless, there are still many intuitions that are blatantly and clearly wrong. An example of such could be

Both are the wrong paths. The LLM reward function is the correct prediction of the next word. However, much more complex behaviors have emerge. We all well know that LLMs can appear to reason, to have social preferences, to exhibit decision biases.

Complex patterns coming out of simple rules is not a new thing. Human mind itself, is nothing but neurons (basically wires) obeying the physics of transmissions of electrical signals. You can capture that fairly accurately with a differential equation. I don't have to tell you the complexity of human behaviors.

More attention needs to be focused on this emergent behavior. Unfortunately there is little formal framework that produces good insights. The closest is nonlinear dynamcs/chaos which cannot handle really complex systems. The other approach is one akin to human psychology, which relies on a lot of empirical observations and latent constructs.</div>

We also clearly need something that can use tools and do actions for recursively self-improvement, and accelerating scientific discovery.  
But your focus on emergent reactions and tying it into a formal framework is just undefined nonsense, and doesn't make clear if you're changing incentives, studying it or whatever. The emergent behavior arises exactly as a product of the reward function, and then saying both reward function and architecture is the wrong path. It is literally all there is LMAO.

“Iran is the head of the snake &amp; it needs to be chopped off.”
First heard it &amp; thought that was an odd way to put it but reporters on these channels like to be descriptive. Flip to next channel &amp; with a minute or so, that guy says exact same thing. Took me back a bit.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's been that way for a while now, autonomous fine-tuners/evaluators have been the target of a lot of research, [for example](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ohJxgRLlLt). The main crux tends to be about whether the gains compared to supervised loops generalize (rather than being spiky) and whether they actually go far in practice. ICM's advantage is that it's elicitation though, so the stronger the base model the better the gains, so it should be scalable in theory, at least for the kinds of problems they've tested it on.

[One of the researchers adds](https://x.com/jiaxinwen22/status/1933196263463452818):

&gt;want to clarify some common misunderstandings  
\- this paper is about elicitation, not self-improvement.  
\- we're not adding new skills --- humans typically can't teach models anything superhuman during post-training.  
\- we are most surprised by the reward modeling results.  Unlike math or factual correctness, concepts like helpfulness &amp; harmlessness are really complex. Many assume human feedback is crucial for specifying them. But LMs already grasp them surprisingly well just from pretraining!

Seems like the automated better version of RLHF through elicitation and it works for more fuzzy concepts like helpfulness, something RLHF was originally designed for and seemed like a no-brainer topic for language models to automate labeling for, seeing as they're already pretty powerful at language.

Also cool to see Jan Leike as a contributor, seeing as "RLHF but automated, better and achievable by a smaller model" was exactly what he was advocating for research-wise for a long while now.</div>

But then one night when I was laying in bed and having an anxiety attack I remembered something I learned in a mindfulness course my mom had made me take a few years back. It was a big shift. I just surrendered to the present moment. I learned to just watch all the bodily sensations, but I watched it from a distance.

I started with being aware of my body, then mind, then breadth itself. I was aware of different experiences. Then
Quest arises to go beyond this experience.
I entered in space from which it seems all the vibration or noise coming out from that space. Every sound which I was aware of was happening in that space. 

I don't know whether this experience was itself my own creation of mind, because I listen to many Spiritual related talks regarding space where all the thing 
happen or it was real. 
But in that space there was peace, silence and stillness. I saw that when we connect with any vibration happening in that space we lose our real identification. Which is nothing.</div>

What's going to happen when the brain starts physically growing and the chip and its interfacing are connected to cerebral structures that are constantly reconfiguring themselves as they grow?

* Persona Role
* Scenario Context
* User input
* System Message
* Specific Task
* If/Else Logic
* Iteration
* Output Format
* Structured Data Output

And loads more...

Each of these you drag on and connect the nodes/ to create the flow. You can then modify the data on...</div>

Any time I see prompt libraries or prompt builders I just don't get it. Is writing a prompt yourself or having AI write a prompt for you a big enough problem for folks that it requires a dedicated solution?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Or you should just understand that what you’re putting in won’t be reciprocated to the same degree, and find peace with that. 

Your capacity to give may be greater than another’s, but that is not necessarily a disconnect in the amount of joy the other derives and appreciates from the relationship. The measure is whether or not you can be satisfied with the relationship as is, or if you stopped contributing, would the loss be greater than the effort required to maintain it, even if unbalanced. 

Life and relationships are not 50-50, and if you’re constantly trying to balance the scales, you’ll be robbed of the joy of the present; as well as what might have been. Love fully and unconditionally, and sometimes that will sting you, but the highs you’ll experience far outweigh the monotony of playing games instead of living your life.</div>

Before I started matching her energy, I tried to have conversations with her about where we stand but she would leave me on read and not communicate. It’s okay if she doesn’t have the capacity to be my friend, but it was interesting that she acted all surprised when I started treating her the same way.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think part of it is a mismatch in energy, but also some people view friendships like transactions, which isn't healthy.

If one of my friends plans a fun outing for me to join them on, I view that as a gift. I am very grateful and appreciative of any gift from a friend. If that same friend started to passive aggressively guilt trip me for not reciprocating by planning the next trip, then I'd probably start wishing I never joined them on their previous trip.

Some people are so concerned about what's 'owed' them by their friends that they end up alienating those friends. Giving without expecting anything in return is the best way to build strong lasting friendships.</div>
