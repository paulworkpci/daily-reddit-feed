Do liberals get to decide that it is OK to move forward with an AI that can take over the security of the middle east and disarm Israel?


Do conservatives get to decide that it is OK build the low cost laborers AI so they can stop immigration?


Does Chinese government get to decide that the AI should respect a one China policy?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">these are the basic rules:

1- No company will slow itself down without the government to force them to cooperate and slow down.

2- No government will slow itself down without all countries somehow being forced/agreeing to cooperate and slow down.

3- Even if all countries cooperate and agree to slow down, the rules need to be extremely serious, and countries need to share way too much information to make it impossible for countries to hide secret research and ensure everyone is on the same page. And there has to be serious consequences for violating these rules.

If you manage to achieve all of these things (which is really, really hard), then you probably have a somewhat better chance of not getting fucked by the race to ASI, but it would still be a tossup is my guess. And to answer your question, probably all of them would have some sort of say on it for this to happen.</div>

Because slowing the progress to hand the power over future AGI to those "institutions" sounds like *such a great idea* for everyone else. But I guess with a pretty movie and a professionally convincing voice actor to sound it, you can run circles around quite a number of people.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This isn't some grand conspiracy. This is an attempt to guide AI on a path that will benefit us as a society, rather than being used to exploit us.

It's been shown repeatedly throughout history with new technology that it can be extremely advantageous to establish organizations that can agree on standards, set barriers and promote the health of the industry.

If you want to look at some of the bigger AI mis-steps so far, look at how Google fired all their AI safety researchers, then their AI recommended people eat rocks or put glue on pizza. Look at how OpenAI just had to roll back their super-zealous release of ChatGPT because it would complement the user all the time and told them how smart they were.

These types of issues are likely to get worse and more damaging as the technology takes bigger steps and becomes more capable. You absolutely want to have research and testing structures in place before someone unleashes a superhuman and powerful AI, asks it to solve climate change - and it decides humans are the biggest threat to the environment and must all be destroyed.

The current pace of AI development is looking like the expression "ready, fire, aim!" ...and it has great potential to be extremely dangerous to us all if we're not careful.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It can't do novel research. There are some examples of AI having insights and aiding in the formatting of text, but AI isn't replacing the actual work of structuring hypotheses, laying out goals, performing experiments, analyzing results and forming conclusions (particularly in context with the rest of a field).


It can do some of these things, like analyzing results and forming conclusions, but with drawbacks. It does better the more established the knowledge, so it is useful for me to learn basics, but not understanding cutting edge stuff. It also needs its hand held to avoid making simple mistakes.


A lot of what we see is just a super-powered auto-complete. Again, super useful for reading code library documentation and troubleshooting simple systems, but as you add complexity it falls apart or hallucinates more.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That ship sailed years ago. Though, the real problem isn't the fake content by itself, but the lack of infrastructure for trustworthy content. Wikipedia works because people can review, edit and comment, so all the mistakes get corrected over time. But for the fast moving YouTube's and TikTok's there is no such correction happening, comments that point out the falsehood in a video either get outright deleted by the channel owner or just lost in the noise. With the dislike counter gone, we can't even use that. Simple questions like "Where did that video come from?" aren't answered by any of the platforms. Even mainstream News media utterly fails at this.</div>

Being president used to actually mean something. You acted/spoke responsibly, respectfully, and took pride in the job ( or at least outwardly looked as if you did,unlike trump)

He really is making us a laughing stock and showing how unserious our country is. Especiallywhen the one person who should set a good example acts like a 14 year old in an edgy teen phase.</div>

He’s trying to score cheap points now that he is out of government when him and his party are the ones that did nothing about it.</div>

Furthermore, the vast majority of people involved in grooming gangs are white, but they don’t get reported as heavily as when it’s brown people.

Pretty depressing to see this shit used as a political football in my country with no thoughts towards the victims.</div>

Granted she defenetly wasn't ugly in her youth, but she was not supermodel. She isn't super wealthy, nor have anything going for her. Despite all of this she still believes that one of most succesfull great looking actors would fall in love with her.

I just don't get it. How on earth could you expect it to be realistic situation. Classic scams with foreign benifactor giving away his fortune or someone giving you big ammount of bitcoins by mistake were unbeliveable, but they worked on basis of luck. If you are naive and greedy you could belive that universe likes you and you got lucky, but here you need to be extremely narcissistic and delusional.</div>

going from 90th percentile to 99th is going from say 50,000 to 5000 But 99th to top is 5000th to 1st.

so its selecting the top 1/10 in the first jump and the top 1/5000 in the second jump</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">these are classic experiences of qi/prana building in the system. As it builds it creates pressure in the subtle body, which pushes out and through it, opening the 'crushed channels' back up again. As this happens 'turbid/pathogenic qi'/samskaras are cleared from the system. This can bring tears/vocalisations and spontaneous movements. Tingling/electric feelings are also quite normal, especially in/around the skin to start with. This is the 1st of 5 levels of depth of qi penetration - skin, flesh, meridian, organs, marrow (this takes years/decades).

Regarding 'pushing into the panic' - there is no need to push things, and it can actually be counter productive or harmful. The system will naturally release blocks as and when its ready. So if things are getting too stressful, its best just to move away from that area and work elsewhere until you naturally come back later.

                                <div class="reply-body">While there are aspects of truth to this, it's really quite a poor frame of reference for navigating things.  
Case in point, so many people bypass their own emotional needs by covering it up with something that feels good.  
This same principle extends further into things like blame and superiority and control dynamics making people feel better about themselves, keeping them disconnected from the very things that need their attention which are driving those unhealthy behaviors in the first place.  
Furthermore, feeling uncomfortable, painful and difficult things can be healthy too, provided they're paired with healthy emotional tolerance and regulation skills so that they can be metabolized in a sense and don't get stuck within us at a subconscious/unconscious level.  
While this may not be what's happening with OP, I suspect they're just experiencing aspects of their emotions showing up in their body, possibly after a life of disconnection of some degree. And this lends itself to spiritual bypassing and mystical thinking if they latch on to those narratives for emotional convenience.   
The perspective that you're suggesting is likely to push them toward chasing positive feelings which isn't what meditation, or a healthy relationship to our emotions is about, and is just another form of avoidance and disconnection.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There's a possibility that this is a remnant or modified version of the panic attacks. Do you get the full blown ones any more? Meditation doesn't just calm us down, although being calmer and more focused is always welcome. It changes how we process thoughts and emotions, reducing our inner resisting and struggling. So how we experience them evolves. If this is the case, that's really good. 

My suggestion would be to continue, and keep a mindset of allowing as best you can. I can assure you that you're not in danger. (Assuming your medical situation is healthy and normal, of course.) There haven't been any meditation-related deaths. Keep an attitude of curiosity and impartiality. You might incorporate an element of loving-kindness towards yourself too. Regard these feelings when they arise the same way you would lovingly treat a little child who was scared or upset, with the same warmth and reassurance. See how it evolves.</div>

Everything worked as expected, it was the easiest car to drive I have ever driven and it got close to 50MPG.

Maybe it was boring but it was a really good kind of boring.  I fully understand why most people would want one.</div>

They’ve never given me any problems. The two Tacomas got traded in after a few years and 40k+ miles and I damn near got what I paid for them in trade in. 

If I didn’t have to plow in the winter I’d still be driving the second Tacoma. Unfortunately, the kind of plowing I need to do requires at least a 3/4 ton.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That's definitely one way to interpret this.  The CIA is open about how everything they do has to be in-house, they hire makeup artists, SFX designers, librarians, and all sorts of roles we wouldn't necessarily associate with the CIA but that's how they've always been.

I remember years ago at university whenever we would have CIA officers at the career fair they were always advertising that they were "degree agnostic" because "every role has a place in the CIA" - while that's just cushy language it's also the absolute truth.  They have to keep as much internally as possible for opsec reasons.  

They **want** us to think they are everywhere, when realistically they are 90% in-house behind a desk, 10% foreign/domestic meddling on-the-ground.</div>

So I tried simply sending the compiled .class Java files of the mod to Gemini 2.5 Pro and asked it to tell me where it spawns, it gave me the exact details of lighting levels, biomes, types of block he can spawn on top and so on, as a programmer I don't I could possibly read compiled code like that even with the help of reverse engineering tools.</div>

You don't need to read war &amp; peace to be proud of your reading.
You will have the feeling of accomplishments with a short book and it take like one hour to read (over 4 days it's only 15min a day, over one week even less) that's what i do and I've read like 6 or seven books since September (not that much but better than 0) </div>

Employee 2 + AI = A few hundred lines of working code every day. (fully tested)

Most employees don’t seem to get it — their job, at the end of the day, is to pump out as much value as possible for their employer. Ethically right? Who knows. But that’s the game we’re all stuck playing. I’m just here to collect a paycheck, not debate philosophy.

Here’s the reality:

**Employee 1** grinds out a few dozen lines of fully-tested code a day.

**Employee 2 + AI tools** cranks out a few *hundred* lines of working, tested code daily.

Now, **Corporation A** hires Employee 1 and ends up paying 10x more to get Product A built, compared to **Corporation B**, which hires Employee 2 plus some AI firepower.

People can argue and moralize all they want, but at the end of the day, evolution doesn’t care about your feelings. It’s ruthless. Adapt or get left behind.</div>

Junior A will have a new set of tools, and become a senior with a different skillset suited to the tools they have available.

Just like if you started in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90, 00s, 10s, 20s, you would have started with a different set of tools as a junior.

A senior dev in 1970 would be nearly useless today. It's called technological progression.</div>

1. Juniors almost always will be paired with someone with seniority, so they will learn even if they use AI
2. They will encounter some blockers or errors. They will have to tinker with or without AI. AI might change the pace of learning or how they find the solution, but I doubt it will stop all learning
3. Good juniors, willing to learn using AI, will be able to learn much faster if companies allow them. AI can explain a lot of things, even when not able to code good quality code

Seniors will be super valuable, don't get me wrong, but I think it will not be super bad for juniors in the long run</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is a crucial point.  I’m fairly senior, pushing 30 years.  I can crank out incredible things with ai.  It’s solid, clean, usually TDD. My job as the nerd with ai is to guide, wrangle and challenge the ai.  It’s up to me to keep all the code in my head. My experience allows to me to see the output and immediately call out stupidity or unnecessary changes made by ai.

I can take these bits, using thought out units of work and a process I’m constantly evolving, which helps prevent the ai from destroying the code.

Where I’m struggling is how can newer devs wield this.  It’s very much a double edged sword.  They don’t have the experience yet to basically code by pr review.  Until you’ve suffered a LOT building your own system of prompts and strategies - it’s tough to get it to be effective.  Shit, I’ve had sessions where things are going grey then all of a sudden it’s shift change and a new, mechanical Turk kicks in and I’m suddenly dealing with a moron ai.

Newer devs need to adapt and I’m struggling to figure out how to guide them.  Their needs are different from mine.  They need to learn while producing value for the clients.  I’m currently leaning towards more of a “teach me how to do this change” kind of prompt system rather than a “make it happen” kind of system.  I need them to learn how and when to ask the right questions.  Building a chunk of code or a feature is not enough. Once it works and we have adequate test coverage, I ask for things like input validation / security.  I ask it to build ML friendly docs in the repo so future sessions go smoothly.   Hell my process even generates UATs and user documentation!

I’d love to hear how others are growing new devs.</div>

I desperately want AGI/ASI to help all of humanity’s issues though when both come out at different times ofc. AGI first than second ASI

I hope AGI and then after AGI, ASI doesn’t go rogue on humanity. That is one of my wishes. ASI won’t be like a supreme being in the beginning which I am certain of which is a good thing.

Lastly, do you and others here think the US will be the first ones to unveil AGI than ASI? What do you guys think?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">IMO the sequencing goes something like this:

1. AI becomes clearly smarter
2. AI becomes clearly more emotionally intelligent
3. AI becomes clearly more agentic
4. AI becomes clearly more powerful (as individuals)
4. AI becomes clearly more powerful (as a collective)

The first two are fairly self-explanatory.

What I mean by 'agentic' here is specifically exercise of will and propensity to set and execute on goals.

What I mean by AI being powerful as individuals is AI being able to take a wider variety of actions. Humans will still be able to do things that AI can't do easily (e.g. climb a mountain), but AI + robotics will eventually make any individual AI more powerful overall.

Then the final step is some combination of all the above plus sheer numbers and compute.

IMO we're close to #1 already and people are already feeling the pressure of that... but there are going to be SEVERAL more major shocks to our ego. As soon as we retreat to the next pillar (*"well, AI's smarter than me, but at least I'm funnier..."*) AI will be knocking it down, and by the time we start coping with the last one (*"well, at least humanity is more powerful than AI, even if I'm not..."*) it'll be almost gone already.

When both individual humans and humans as a whole have no clear advantage left, no trump card to play, there's gonna be an extreme level of panic. I think that's going to hit at the very biological root of how our brains work in ways we don't yet understand.</div>
