                                <div class="reply-body">Ah yes, the Amanita muscaria. The mushroom of fairy tales, hallucinations, and *regrettable confidence in your ability to identify wild fungi*. Let’s take a walk through the forest, shall we? Try not to lick anything.

---

### **Amanita muscaria**  
**Common name:** Fly agaric  
**Appearance:**  
It’s the red one with the white polka dots—yes, *that* one. The iconic toadstool. The emoji 🍄. Looks like something straight out of a Mario level or a Grimm Brothers fever dream.  
- **Cap:** Bright red (sometimes orange) with white warts (those aren’t always present if rain has washed them off).  
- **Stem:** White with a ring (annulus) and a bulbous base often with a sac-like volva.  
- **Spores:** White.

---

### **Where It Grows:**  
Basically *anywhere trees are having a secret underground party*. It forms a symbiotic relationship with roots of birch, pine, spruce, and fir. So, forests in the Northern Hemisphere, mostly. But humans being humans, it’s been introduced all over the damn place now.

---

### **Why People Care About It:**  

1. **Toxicity:**  
   Contrary to popular belief, it’s **not usually deadly**, but it *is* a chemical clown car.  
   - Contains **muscimol** and **ibotenic acid**—neuroactive compounds that mess with GABA receptors.  
   - Symptoms include nausea, confusion, delirium, twitching, sweating, euphoria, talking to invisible forest creatures, and possibly wetting yourself while having a chat with a pinecone.  
   - Cooking, drying, or **parboiling** can reduce toxicity, but you still risk a ticket to *the weird show*.  

2. **Cultural Use:**  
   - **Siberian shamanism:** Used for spiritual experiences. Sometimes the shaman would take it and others would drink *his urine* to experience a more filtered effect. Yes. That’s real. Yes. People drank shaman pee.  
   - **Santa Claus theories:** Red and white mushroom + reindeer (also known to nibble the stuff and prance around high) + winter solstice rituals = overconfident folk history documentaries.  
   - **Alice in Wonderland:** The caterpillar sat on one and told Alice to take bites from different sides to change her size. Which… accurate enough, metaphorically.

3. **Modern Use:**  
   - Some people microdose it. This is stupid.  
   - Some people make tinctures. This is slightly less stupid, but still risky.  
   - There is a current trend of “detoxifying” it into something drinkable. These are often the same people who stare at fireflies for six hours and say it changed their life.

---

### **Important Note:**  
There are **much more dangerous Amanitas**—*Amanita phalloides* (the death cap) being the star of that grim show. If you're the kind of person who thinks "I can totally tell mushrooms apart," you might as well start preparing your liver transplant paperwork now.

---

### **Conclusion:**  
Amanita muscaria is beautiful, iconic, psychotropic, and toxic.  
It is **not a snack**.  
It is **not a reliable spiritual shortcut**.  
It is **not a reason to lick forest floor fungi because Reddit told you to**.  

But it is absolutely a poster child for the phrase:  
&gt; “Just because it’s in a fairy tale doesn’t mean you should put it in your mouth.”

                        <div class="comment-body">I use Github Copilot in agent mode with Sonnet 4.5, inside VSCode. I tried Roo Code and Claude Code, didn't like it and went back to Copilot. I will never use any platforms like Lovable because they are inside a web browser. I use VSCode daily for years, I have many plugins there and don't feel the need to move to another, less controlled environment. The need to have full control is also the reason why I will never user AI to make initial project setup of a project or to make commits for me

I don't ship SaaS MVP's though, I just have couple of open source projects that I work on</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">People saying Copilot are missing the point of the question. OP the **fastest** way to actually "ship" stuff, is something like v0. There is no world where anything using copilot is faster to ship than v0. You can literally vibe code and deploy entire web apps with backends in 10 minutes in v0, good luck doing that with copilot.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;EU officials must revisit the hastily agreed trade deal with the US, where the EU stated that it “intends to accept” lower US vehicle standards, say cities - including Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, and more than 75 civil society organisations. In a letter to European lawmakers, the signatories warn that aligning European standards with laxer rules in the US would undermine the EU’s global leadership in road safety, public health, climate policy and competitiveness.

&gt;The deal agreed over summer states that *“with respect to automobiles, the United States and the European Union intend to accept and provide mutual recognition to each other’s standards.”* Yet, EU vehicle safety regulations have supported a [36% reduction](https://etsc.eu/wp-content/uploads/15-PIN-annual-report-FINAL.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) in European road deaths since 2010. By contrast, road deaths in the US over the same period [increased 30%](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2024-02/2024%20NRSS%20Progress%20Report.pdf), with pedestrian deaths up 80% and cyclist deaths up 50%.

&gt;Europe currently has mandatory requirements for life-saving technologies, such as pedestrian protection, automated emergency braking and lane-keeping assistance. Some of the most basic pedestrian protection requirements which have long been in place in the EU, such as deformation zones in the front of vehicles to reduce crash severity and the prohibition of sharp edges have made cars like the Tesla Cybertruck illegal to sell in Europe.</div>

The [reddit thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1mzxmjf/us_eu_may_recognize_each_others_car_safety/) on this was just that the US and EU would allow each others standards (ie a USDM car could be sold in Europe and vice-versa).

                                <div class="reply-body">None of this makes sense.

For example, you *can* import European cars that are less than 25 years old. Except the NHTSA will require you to federalize it; meaning modify it to make it 'safe' for US roads. Depending on the car, this will mean things like replacing the windshield, replacing ALL the glass, replacing the headlights/tail lights, strengthening doors by adding a cross member under the skin, replacing the seatbelt system. I've spent years trying to import a specific handful of cars but at every turn, the NHTSA told me the car was unsafe until federalized; yet it's totally fine anywhere in Europe. These weren't odd-ball sports cars, but things like a Mercedes C class wagon with a diesel and a manual (r/cars holy trinity)

According to the US, Euro cars are not safe enough for US roads. According to the EU, US cars are not safe enough for European roads.

All of this is partisan posturing stemming from government red tape fighting slightly different government red tape. We should stop blindly picking "our side" and ask ourself what actually makes sense.</div>

its all backwards, and the data backs it up, but we all know that safety is really not the purpose of these regulations, same way CAFE is not really reducing emissions but more so making cars bigger so emissions to volume ratio passed the book</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean it’s the same problem standards have everywhere across all industries. In order to have a unified standard, people have to agree on what the standard actually is, and everyone has their own individual ideas on what is better. 

Take emission standards for example, the US treats diesel and petrol as equals and they both must meet the same rules, but in the EU they wanted to focus on CO2 in particular so they carved out exemptions for diesels to allow them to pollute more in other areas (namely NOx). The EU wouldn’t want the US’ rules on diesels because it would kill off an entire industry of diesel passenger cars, but the US also wouldn’t want the EU rules because it’s dirtier than what they already have. 

And then I sit down here in Australia with our 2009-era Euro5 regulations because apparently modern emission controls are too good for us.</div>

Come home and people think I was in a war zone.and barely escaped. It is sad that people are so misinformed.  Hanging out in Haight Ashbury at night, pretty much anywhere really. They lie.</div>

I've been to countless numerous small towns in the Midwest and the South that look like Chernobyl but yet view areas like San Fransico as a warzone.</div>
