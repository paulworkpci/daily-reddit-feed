                                <div class="reply-body">The only reason I originally listened to him is because he talked about his research or academic learnings or brought on other researchers, which was very refreshing and genuinely interesting to hear. Many times I would pause and look up terms, because obviously a lot of these discussions are way above my pay grade. But that was genuinely intriguing.

Now he's just like everyone else. The further these people move away from their educational intrigue and the more Rogansphere people they bring in, the worse and more pseudointellectual these podcasts get. Really unfortunate.</div>

The same flaw in the personality that originally steers them toward the steroids, is also the one that allows them to effortlessly lie to you to take money from you.  They prey on the fact that most people have never messed with steroids &amp; therefore can't recognize the obvious signs that they do them.

You can literally sum it all up in that first sentence - it's the same hustle just done on different platforms.  &amp; even if they don't start out that way, they all end up arriving there.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">the timing is a bit suspect considering he's likely known he has cancer for a while now. I suppose its possible he literally just found out and immediately released it, but seems odd considering he was President and we know he was getting top notch medical treatment and exams. Got one in Feb 2024. Would be unusual that they find nothing then and then a little over a year later its already metastasized into the bone. It's possible though I guess. Since people either somehow "missed" the cognitive decline (or lied about it) it's not too far out of line to think they may have known about this and didn't reveal that either.</div>

Then I observed something curious: someone starts with $0 and sets a goal of $100,000—when they reach it, they’re extremely happy. But someone else earning $200,000 who su...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt; Many people suffering from mental health issues have heard that meditation helps. But when you start mining your own happiness, mental health issues begin to fade away—as if they never existed.

This is dangerous and foolish advice. Not all mental health issues can be resolved through meditation, or without the help of specialised therapy, including drugs.

Saying "You don’t need anything else but meditation." puts the blame on people who that is not enough, and can make them feel it is wrong to search out treatments that would help them.

Meditation is good and valuable for many areas of life, but it is not a panacea.</div>

Come on, could they not at least try?  Sure, it's a new LIMITED EDITION shade of white and LIMITED EDITION matte black instead of glossy, but you can buy a regular IS500 with white paint on black rims right now.  Imagine spending money on this and it basically looks like a fleet special.</div>

The accelerationist will say, this is insane, look how realistic it is, full length AI generated on-demand movies are 6 months away.

The critic will say, it's garbage, it's still uncanny, no serious movie studio will use anything like this for many years.

The doomer will say, this is awful, it will be used for misinformation and fake news.

And lastly, the lonely horny redditor will say it's BULLSHIT that it doesn't do NSFW</div>

However, in any half-decent marriage however there is total marital confidentiality. So it doesn't really matter that the person you tell something secret to will share it with his husband/wife, since he/she (ideally) doesn't have another wife/husband with whom she/he inevitable shares this with.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">That is something I’ve noticed about AI discussions outside of AI-focused forums like this one. I’m also on threads and see a fair amount of AI-related posts; probably 80% of them are negative and so many of their arguments against AI feel like the person’s training cutoff with respect to AI related information is July 2023.

Just today I asked o3 what I consider a hard regulatory question related to my job. It’s a question I intuitively knew the answer to from doing this job for well over a decade, but I didn’t know the specific legal rationale behind it. It was able to find the relevant information on its own and answer the question correctly (which I was able to check from the source it cited). I would imagine 95% of the people I work with don’t know it can do that.</div>

&gt;That is something I’ve noticed about AI discussions outside of AI-focused forums *like this one*. 

Even in this sub and other AI Forums, there are a great number of people who really cannot grasp exponential growth/improvement rates and seem to lack practical experience in both AI or work environments but are itching to share their 'viewpoint'.

Comment here about the timescale for replacement of technical roles and you get an overwhelming response that seems to think all technical roles are high skill individual full stack developers.  They completely ignore that the vast majority of technical roles worldwide are actually offshored support and maintenance with relatively simple responsibilities.</div>

He bet me $500 that today’s models can’t answer that question (9.9 vs 9.11) reliably. I proved they could by wording it unambiguously  and doing it 20 times with each major model and getting 100% correct answer rate. Buddy flaked out though because he showed that if you ask it over and over in the same chat session ignoring its correct answers on the 3rd ask it flips, my examples focused on a fresh chat asking the question straight up no tricks. Didn’t get paid. Moral of the story? Even AI “experts” don’t know shit about AI.</div>

Some sections had almost 6 months wait until someone could perform a first reading. The patient would have already gotten their second imaging exam before the first was answered. Some of them had acute conditions too. As someone who's job is on the line if AI takes over image reading, 6 months is completely unacceptable, and even a mediocre AI reading is probably better than nothing.</div>

Not because they're a great exercise, but because it's so accessible. You can do a dead hang anywhere. This exercise is also really accessible for almost everybody because you can get to the 6 minutes at your own pace. If you can only hang for 5 seconds, you'll just get back at it. Requires very little motivation. I personally like hanging on my staircase.

                        <div class="comment-body">Unreal. I woke up this morning in a lot of pain with my back. Literally just read this and decided to hang from the underside of the fire escape stairs at the back of the office. 

As soon as I had my weight on my hands I felt a strong POP in my left shoulder and thought I’d just dislocated the damn thing. I immediately got down and my back feels soooooooo much better! 

I’m still in a bit of shock tbh. I hadn’t felt anything off with my shoulder before and it’s fine now but the instant relief from my back is so so nice. Still a bit tender but I’m no longer worried about needing to go home early to lay down for the rest of the day. 

Thanks a million OP!</div>

I think dead hangs are great for posture and stretching but acting like they are super accessible is not all that accurate (making special trips to the park is not super convenient unless you’re already going to the park)</div>

Its really not hard to pay lip service in a short clip to a cause that is extremely popular,  most ISREALIS, let alone people around the world are against what Isreal is doing in Gaza.

whats hard is having principles, and Theo literally released this video in between having dinner with Kushner (currently gathering investors to develop the land isreal is stealing in gaza) and going on tour with Trump (currently helping Iareal orchestrate an ethnic cleansing)

This video doesn't make Theo compassionate or a brave, it just makes him a massive hypocrite</div>

Theo had Gabor Mate in, who is a holocaust survivor and understands trauma really well as it is his expertise.

Theo gets pretty emotional about it all so he’s been feeling bad about this for awhile.

That is a disappointment, it is a very good system, just needs more work.

Why is it a good thing? It looks like we still have a job for the next 6 months, until the end of the year, and that is a good thing 😊
