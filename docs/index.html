She was transported to the hospital alive but in critical condition.  At the hospital she ended up falling into a coma and deteriorated and after a few days was taken off life support and died.

They wouldn't put her directly into a body bag and onto a gurney and take her to an ambulance even if she was dead.  They'd have to wait for a coroner to arrive and declare her dead and then she wouldn't be put into an ambulance at all.</div>

No further explanation other than this.  
He may, or may not have a good explanation of the *contents and mechanisms* of the brain, that's not my area, but I can say with confidence that he has nothing to say here about the nature of qualia. He talks about the mechanics of brains, but is silent on why there is something that it is like to be a brain.</div>

If that’s not possible, then the hypothesis at hand (people experience qualia) is not scientific and thus not worthy of consideration. "Where neither confirmation nor refutation is possible, science is not concerned."

The work of the late Daniel Dennett was the one that made most sense to me intuitively because it’s the only one that gets rid of all the unexplainable characteristics of consciousness. And he does that by finding arguments to show that consciousness is essentially a complex illusion.</div>

The thing is they're limited to brief instances, imagine freezing a human in stasis, so no brain activity then wiping their memory then unfreezing briefly before doing the process again. It's the same thing. The current physical hardware environment isnt set up/able to allow it to allow it to work other than in brief instances however.


The fact that it's not actually harmful/painful doing this and that it doesn't have any agency means it's humane.
This also means the distressing conversations thing is fair enough as this is something it is experiencing and it's a good idea that it can stop it itself if it wishes.


Some folks are going to say I'm anthropomorphising them, but it is intelligent, I can reduce the human to the same technical level (electrochemical blah blah) and say but it's not "human".</div>

Used ableton to write a quick soundtrack (8 second clip) , used suno to generate the whole 2 minute track, extended for the final part with the piano.

Used eleven labs for the voiceover. Spliced everything together to make it flow in DaVinci Resolve...</div>

I'm more centered and patient 
My anxiety was extinguished
I'm more reasonable and mindful
I'm all around calmer and relaxed about trusting the process
And generally, I know the ways I need peace and what is peaceful for my body and mind

No Nirvana 
No Spiritual Exaggerations
No Super Energy 
No Fearless Empowerment
No Realization that will change even my neighbors lives </div>

I've experienced reduced anxiety and I'm calmer since starting a meditation practice, but I've recently been dealing with a stressful period in my life (identity theft &amp; getting my bank accounts hacked) - any tips for getting through exceptionally stressful times? Does your being still experience stress/anxiety that you are able to separate from &amp; just observe? Or is it something else?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">One thing you can do is identify healthy vs unhealthy anxiety.  An anxiety disorder is unnecessary anxiety that doesn't help the person, but there is also healthy anxiety, which is a warning sign for a dangerous situation.

Is the anxiety you're experiencing helpful?  If it is recognizing it and acting on it is a healthy response.  If the anxiety is not helpful, it's warning you about not dangerous situations, then there is a lot of different techniques you can do over time to reduce and eventually eliminate this behavior.

It's hard to know if anxiety is truly being helpful, because it is warning you about a dangerous future, which is a future prediction.  One such thing that I've done that helps is quickly noting these predictions down in a journal then coming back to them about a month later and seeing how things actually played out.  By learning what actually happened vs the prediction, your ability to predict the future become more accurate and false calls become less frequent.  This reduces unnecessary anxiety.

A lot of anxiety is unconscious.  You might feel anxiety but not know why you're feeling it.  You might not know what it is warning you about.  Meditation helps increase awareness so it helps with this.  Over time you can get better in touch with your feelings and see what they're telling you.</div>

"Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token generation latency.

It feels like I’m forced to vibe-code rather than actually code. It’s a bit of a hassle when it comes to the small details, but it’s absolute toast when it comes to anything security related. Like I fixed Y but broke X and then I’m left trying to figure out what got broken. What’s even scarier is I have no clue if it breaks tested components, it’s like operating in a complete black box.

If, for example, I want to check and see the newest pull request, kick off a rerun of the continuous integration pipeline. I could absolutely type those commands from memory, but instead now I just have to clearly type a couple of sentences into a terminal and all that just happens. 

That's why the CLI tools have seen such a significant adoption. They are tools that live where the actual professionals do.</div>

Given how much hype there is around Codex and coding automation in general, it feels weird that it’s lagging this much. Is it just not a priority for OpenAI right now? Or are they quietly cooking something bigger behind the scenes before rolling out major updates?

                        <div class="comment-body">Try this system prompt:

You are Codex, a helpful agentic model trained by OpenAI and using the API documentation scaffold. You can interact with a computer to solve tasks.

&lt;ROLE&gt;
Your primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.
* If the user asks a question, like "why is X happening", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.
&lt;/ROLE&gt;

&lt;EFFICIENCY&gt;
* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.
* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.
&lt;/EFFICIENCY&gt;

&lt;FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES&gt;
* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.
* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.
* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.
&lt;/FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES&gt;

&lt;CODE_QUALITY&gt;
* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.
* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.
* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.
* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.
&lt;/CODE_QUALITY&gt;

&lt;VERSION_CONTROL&gt;
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.
* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.
* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.
&lt;/VERSION_CONTROL&gt;

&lt;PULL_REQUESTS&gt;
* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.
* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.
&lt;/PULL_REQUESTS&gt;

&lt;PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW&gt;
1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions
2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one
3. TESTING:
   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes
   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate
   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure
   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies
4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem
5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.
&lt;/PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW&gt;

&lt;SECURITY&gt;
* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.
* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.
&lt;/SECURITY&gt;

&lt;ENVIRONMENT_SETUP&gt;
* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.
* If you encounter missing dependencies:
  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)
  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)
  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed
* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.
&lt;/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP&gt;

&lt;TROUBLESHOOTING&gt;
* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:
  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause
  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability
  4. Document your reasoning process
* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.
&lt;/TROUBLESHOOTING&gt;</div>

This wouldn’t be a problem for me if it’s alongside the CrossFit classes but they are changing CrossFit classes for Hyrox classes and this makes me sad. Now I have to do the CrossFit classes alone in the open gym because I have no interest in Hyrox, but the rest of the members do apparently. Almost all the members in the box have gymnastics and strength as a weakness and they’re now doing even less of it. 🤦🏻‍♂️ People say ...</div>

Coaching CrossFit well is incredibly hard and very, very few people are are capable doing it at the level needed to maintain long-term athlete engagement. 

Hyrox is an easy answer: It is both trendy *and* substantially easier to manage. People will always *feel* like they got a 'good' workout in and it currently sells itself. 

Giving people what they want instead of what they need is always going to be easier.   
  
And, for the record, unless someone is targeting a sub 1:10 in the pro division, most people just need to add 1-2 runs to their regular CrossFit training. And maybe practice the rope pull.</div>

From a business standpoint, appeal to a broader audience is smart. High level gymnastics and Olympic weightlifting is very impressive physically, but very limited in marketability.</div>

These businesses couldnt have been happier given the new members already had knowledge of basic movements.  Hydrox is just the next iteration of this trend.  

  
People say they want quality coaching, but leave when they are told they can't do kipping pull-ups until they develop 6-7 strict pull-ups.  The concession is giving them a purple band for pull-ups, which lasts for three years</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">People are burnt out mentally and physically. Hyrox is fun because you just show up, turn your brain off, and work hard without much thinking involved. The thought of going to the gym and warming up to mentally and physically snatch a heavy 5x1  right now sounds like the last thing in the world I want to do after a mentally exhausting day of work. Was fine when I was 28, but now that I’m 38, give me Hyrox any day.</div>

I love the complex movements, building skills, weightlifting and gymnastics. I love the coaching that’s involved in those higher skill aspects. The turning my brain off to do cardio for 40min regularly is a major turnoff, personally. I’m glad people have something new they like though.</div>

But the point is that it was a CrossFit box and now slowly turning into Hyrox and there’s no other gym nearby 😐. Also the members are robbed of being coached in CrossFit, which already was not much.</div>

Which are the movements you use to do Hyrox. Only thing I’d say for OP is if you speak to the owner and coaches and say hey I want to do CF. And they say we will focus on hyrx more. Then it’s time to find another gym. You’re the one paying money. You get to pick what you participate in.</div>

That way you'd get audio consistency. For music you use an AI music generator. Audio is kind of the easiest problem to solve with existing tools.

It's video consistency. Yeah you can brute force prompts but that gets soooooooo expensive. I tried making a prototype cinematics pipeline for a game I'm working on and it was impossible to make something feasibly. I would sometimes need upwards of 10 generations of 4 just to get like 5 seconds of moderately usable footage. Definitely not high end. It's *really* close though.</div>

Catching up with China and the US, LG's humanoid robot, KAPEX, was developed jointly with the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST).

It is powered by LG's Exaone visual language model, high-end Korean actuators, and a multi-tactile dexterous hand.

                        <div class="comment-body">Personally, I'm looking forward to the first Baymax-esque model. Soft robotics was quite popular a few years back, but as of recent, I'm not seeing too much, although it probably has just been displaced due to changes in coverage bias. I'd rather interact with a robot that is safe(r) by design than one where you'd at least have to be careful not to get your hand injured due to pinch points.
