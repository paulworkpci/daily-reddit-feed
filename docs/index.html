Back in December, I went on a month-long cycling holiday to a remote area of vast landscapes and small towns that felt like they existed half a century in the past. Wherever I went, I had limited to no access to the internet most of the time. During the times when I did have access to the internet, ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A lot of the responses are really just here to dunk of Kentuckians so I just want to provide an actual response.

The biggest concern I have as a Kentuckian isn't just that people are not going to buy $9.3 billion in goods from our state, it's that the resulting consequences will be seen for generations. Something a lot of people may not realize is that most of the distilleries in our state are in small towns. They are almost the entire local economy for some of these areas (and for a few of them, the entire county). Once these distilleries start laying off people it's not like there is somewhere else for them to go work.  These families likely will not have the money or resources to find work elsewhere and with little interest in real estate in those areas they will be tied down by their own assets. Many of those towns already have issues with cyclical poverty but this will just make the problem largely unsolvable.

To be clear, I understand that Kentucky is a bit of a laughing stock for many people and as a liberal living here I can attest that many of the perceptions people have are justified. Personally, I am in complete agreement with the boycott. We can only hope that there is a way for our country to course correct but I can't say I am hopeful of that.

  
Edit: This kinda blew up and while I would like to reply to everyone I only have so much time on my lunch break. I am actually a grocery data analyst and this issue is quite complex. I can write for hours about the downstream effects of this boycott (from the distribution companies, warehouse workers, even the brokers who manager these accounts externally). I just wanted to address a few of the major questions people have been asking:

1) I think the split for people blaming Trump for this is about 20-80. I think most Kentuckians will blame Canadians for boycotting their products without seeing the nuances of any of this. It is terrible and I really wish they could understand why Canadians (or other Americans) would stop buying our products but if there is anything we have learned from this past decade it is that we live in a post-truth era where no amount of facts will satisfy their anger.

2) I worked on Alison Lundergan Grimes's campaign as well as Amy McGrath's and unfortunately both lost to a man who has do irreparable damage to America (McConnell). Something to consider is many Republicans also hate Mitch, it's just that they see him as giving Kentucky footing on a national level. "Having him as Senate Majority Leader means he can do more good for Kentucky" is a very common sentiment among R's who would vote him out otherwise. It's upsetting, I hate it, but I do believe it is possible to replace his seat with a Dem going forward.

3) I cannot be more clear that I believe the boycott is a good thing. I know it will hurt people in Kentucky and I feel like that is probably for the best. My concern isn't that the people who voted for Trump this time around will suffer. It's that their kids, their grandkids, their great-grandkids and so on will suffer as the towns die out, crime rates skyrocket, and isolationism festers.

  
Hope this answers some questions people have and I am happy to respond to any messages later today!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It sucks to see people being tricked into their own suffering. 

Canada did targeted tariffs before at Kentucky, the bourbon industry and these small towns knew what was coming... They could have fought back at this election. Instead they didn't say anything AGAIN until it was too late. 

Owners of these distilleries made a choice to not engage in politics until it was too late. 

Leopards will now have bourbon to go with faces.</div>

Or will they just say “I support Trump but…”

Because 99% of people I read about or talk to who think Trump does bad things or is even directly affected by those bad things either accepts it as a sacrifice for the greater good,  or that it somehow would have happened anyway or the most common response - Kamala would have been worse and corrupt. 

I saw a video of a guy who lost half his property to the border wall he voted for and wanted built.  And he was like oh,  I didn’t know it would be inside built in America.  He still supported Trump but he wanted HIS land excused. 

It’s a cult - how do you bring people out of it?  Do you think losing everything will do that or do you think once they find something they will be right back voting for Trump in 2028 when he’s trying to run a 3rd term.</div>

Weirdly it's via Grok in Twitter only, but you can now ask for arbitrary edits to generated images - e.g. "make the shirt red". And the model will regenerate the image with only that change (modulo very minor details). They deliberately restrict this so you can't edit user provided images.</div>

It’s a bit of a time saver, for sure. But I’m not at all confident in ChatGPT’s ability to actually solve problems in real time. If anything, I’ve found ChatGPT to be actively bad at diagnosing root cause problems from logs. It frequently attempts to solve symptoms, which in turn confuses it into thinking that the symptoms are actually the issue. 

I’ve lost track of the amount of times I’ve given up in frustration after going down a ChatGPT rabbit hole that ultimately amounted to nothing. I’m sure it will get better. But it’s not worth paying that much for it at this point.</div>

                <div class="post-content">In my last years of university I remember a time when I would go back to my apartment on friday evening psyched up about all the freetime I would have over the weekend and how I would use it. By Monday morning I would have created an app or read a research paper or written something.
After school I went to live with my sister and one year later I could hardly concentrate on a single thing for one hour. I work from home so you can imagine how that has played out.
I’ve been trying to regain that p...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This happened to me. It’s part burn out. After a long period of time when you’re functioning at such high capacity, you can burn out… and it can take a while to get out of it.

You may also be in a task paralysis or functional freeze. It can be a combination of all these things. 

You now also lack the structure and accountability school provides. Getting things done, from achieving goals, leveling up, to even social things require much more self-motivation and planning on your part outside of institutions, which becomes another task on the to do list… and as the to do list gets larger and larger, the overwhelm can put you in a freeze state</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">As for how to get out of it, start by trying to get to the core of what might be causing it and see if maybe it might be depression, anxiety, and/or ADHD, because all these things you describe can be symptoms of those. If you get a diagnosis, meds can definitely help… as well as other things, like therapy and exercise. If you go to a mental health professional and don’t get diagnosed with any of these things, I’d recommend mindfulness practices and Google productivity hacks and tips to get out of a functional freeze state. Also check out some of the ADHD subs and see if people’s experiences there resonate with you</div>

Never gained it back, outside a few smaller spurts, and am now in my 50s. As far as I can tell the options are either discipline no matter what, or having some outside person that drags you along on their productivity.

I think these days the only driving force I have comes from my job.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">this may sound as a Google biased answer but I think they're going for serving the models really well they're the only company that has like no pricing for the input tier you can use the flash model in however many tokens you input is like no pricing on that this is zero dollar for the import and really really cheap for the output which is in long term really helpful for apps who just want to use it for normal queries and don't need like a over one level intelligence but I think they should also push the frontier and meet the over one level intelligence really really good as well I think they're doing some stuff with RL and scaling up the models and release is bound to happen sometime around May. I think the Google I.O. is May right?

It's ultra infinitely impressive how capable their small models are. I have no doubt they could create SOTA thinking model - however, it's just a waste of resources at this point and they do not want to compete on this field. Also their direction of tools integration is great.

Submission Statement:
Last month in Oklahoma City, several people captured footage of this strange glowing object in the sky over the course of a few hours. Initially, it seemed like it could be a kite—until you notice the halo effect and the sheer brightness of the light, even at night. It remained illuminated for an extended period, suggesting a powered system I would guess. 

As someone who lives nearby, I’ll be keeping my camera ready in case this phenomenon appears again and I somehow hear about it. Has anyone else seen something similar or have thoughts on what it might be?

**Yes, we're talking about ALIENS**.

Aliens are real. Our government is aware of it. They're calling them "Non-Human Intelligences" because they're not necessarily sure if they're from another planet. It's time to come to terms with this as a society.

Don’t you _want_ disclosure? Isn’t that what this is about? To identify **proof and evidence** and not to just parrot each other on social media?

“Well, Farrah said it and he was quoting Schumer and Schumer was quoting whistleblowers and whistleblowers were second-hand to … well, there’s a movie so it has to be real.”

Why can’t there be firsthand visibility for all of us?

Why is it movie after movie?

Why is it Jake Barber pay-per-view with some cult of Silicon Valley oligarchs?

If the movie has video of something otherwise unexplainable, great but I haven’t seen it yet. 

Isn’t it _possible_ don’t you think … that even a movie this big and full of government names could be continued “passage information?” Don’t you think it’s _plausible_ that the US Government could maaaaybe trying to nurture the belief that we’re the only society on Earth who has close contact with superior life forms?

Again, I haven’t seen the movie yet. I’m not that privileged. So, hopefully it dispels all skepticism somehow, but c’mon - don’t be played. We can all play the game.</div>

I am pretty well out the door.

i do sort of wobble awkwardly at times with my toes still in the doorframe holding the door open because a lot of smart people have been wrong before. sometimes things sort of, spread in our diction or we misinterpret things and convince ourselves. or I've seen people try to claim even around here that its intentional misleading for some purpose

with all that said, it sure seems to be a lot to suggest that there is something going on. and even just looking at the size of the universe a lot would concede something, somewhere.

all we have is what we have to go on, and a lot of people are saying  a lot of things. albeit they sometimes conflict, but my attitude sort of became, if were having congression hearing, okay, fine, I'm down to look a fool, lets talk about it</div>

Then the hemming and hawing and cognitive dissonance starts, baiting me to prove it. The details in the UAPDA are about as unambiguous as one can get, and imply a whole bunch more data is available that led to such unambiguous language. In addition, these players all have much more to lose than gain by pushing this agenda.

All they are asking for is more rigorous and coordinated investigation of weird stuff by people who aren't compromised by others who are motivated to hide stuff that in some cases is 80 years old. And there's the biggest tell, when the DoD/IC won't even allow that.</div>

I think it's wild at this point how many people just go off of stories. We know where to find them, and how to see them. 

Go outside.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; do you think UFOs are real

Not to be pedantic, but this is an obviously true statement. People see things they can't explain in the sky (and water) all the time. Always have. But the question is if there is a coherent phenomena that this is reflective of, or is it simply a by-product of...billions of people looking at things from various vantage points and sometimes things get wonky or you can't recognize them because you don't know/don't have access to all the information about it (such as it being obstructed or you're seeing a new technology/weather event you've never seen before, etc).

UAP are undoubtedly real from a face-validity standpoint. The claims of UAP sightings being indicative of an underlying, connected, and unknown phenomenon are what needs to be tested. So far, no matter who does it (governments, academics, etc), there is always a small subset of sightings (1ish%) that seem to lack prosaic explanations. But what exactly does that mean? That's the debate.</div>

When they say "AGI" potentially by 2027 do they mean capable of replacing like 90%+ of current human jobs? Or maybe an acceleration of recursive self improvement? 


I ask because the "agentic" aspect of LLMs currently seems to suck. And agency seems to be a necessary component of replacing intellectual labor. Are people expecting us to overcome this hurdle very quickly? I guess we should see what agents look like at the end of 2025.

Now once we have that, they will start doing a lot of stuff that makes commerce irrelevant. Growing food on lawns, making cloths, doing all the services we pay for.

At this point what is ubi needed for? If we have servant that can work 24/7 and cooperate with your local community and their robots?</div>

I mean, we already have that kind of robots for decades for manufacturing and they're extremely efficient at doing their jobs. The new robot with AI may replacing some of their human supervisors but not all of them.

Human will be still the supervisor for many years to come until [the last job on earth](https://youtu.be/Yvs7f4UaKLo) finally replaced by AI.</div>

His 'game', advertised non-stop to his 600k followers and RT'd off Musk, sold about 5 planes (?) because he charged $30.

99% of the revenue is from other Twitter-addict founders advertising ***their*** AI product.

Maybe I'm wrong but this is surely just no different to if he just started posting advertisements on his profile?

Plus I'm not so sure it's cool the way he speaks to actual experienced game devs who try highlighting this to him or the security concerns which means the game keeps getting hacked? For someone with 20+ YoE (?) it just seems strange?</div>

From this article at least, it doesn't seem to imply he wants to replace it with anything. Instead, the hope is that "tariffs bring manufacturing home."

Obviously, that's bullshit. It takes years to build the factories that we don't currently have, and he expects to do it with no funding, letting the free market solve it.</div>

I am in the chip industry — like it or not our supply chain is international. Tariffs will increase prices for us, we will have to increase prices, lose business.

CHIPS act was supposed to make it cheaper to bring more manufacturing to the US — and help countering China’s subsidies for their chip making companies.

Tariffs while keeping CHIPS act could have accelerated bringing more manufacturing to the US

Tariffs AND canceling the CHIPS will just benefit Chinese chip makers more than anyone in the short term

So frustrating tbh…</div>
