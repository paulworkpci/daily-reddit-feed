                        <div class="comment-body">Sometimes I wonder if all the insightful people were successful at getting off Reddit.

I remember how the sub was 5 years ago and it's a shadow of it's former self. I recommend any new lurkers try sorting by Best of All Time so you can check out some of the older posts.

One of those posts is called "A Life Wasted" where iirc they mention how scrolling takes away time from hobbies and life. That's why I consider it an informal addiction, because people continue to do it even when it is negatively impacting their life and they want to stop. 

I've been trying to gather my favorite points and sharing those. One that helped was learning to be kinder to myself. When I'm more upbeat I'm less likely to doom scroll. I still have my weak points, I still scroll Reddit and post sometimes.

Another thing that helped was having creative outlets. It makes me want to post on Reddit less because I could be putting that energy towards my own audience rather than a site that will stop talking about the topic in 1 day.

I still kind of hope traditional forums have a revival, as I miss the long term discussion they provided. A single thread could have hundreds of pages of discussion over years, instead of 1 post with 3 comments. lol</div>

For example some people who get an old phone or sell their pc/laptop, I think the most challenging part of no surf is to strictly not scroll for too long while still appreciating some aspects of social media. It has to be all bad to quit, which is not helpful at all. I don’t want to sound judgemental but I feel like most people here are HS / college students who suddenly realize they spent too much time online and their grades are suffering now. I am just saying, I find most posts here rather judgmental and one sided </div>

People don't need to deal with their childhood trauma or be 1% better every day to use the internet less lmao. What they need to do is... use the internet less.

The AI slop has just exposed a problem that was always there. There's value in threads discussing how to fill that time and dealing with side effects etc because those are discussing real direct actions. But I'm not convinced the "here's 5 life-changing lessons" style threads are helping anyone or that people are even remembering them. It's like reading these threads/books gives them a nice feeling in their brain and act as a substitute for actually doing something.</div>

She asked me what I wanted to listen to (had a ton of records) I said whatever. She said she had a special one, didn't think much of it. When she walked back into the living room she was completely naked and sat on my lap.


I damn near had a heart attack.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">**From bj to hospital**

While getting a bj once in my early twenties, I suddenly felt pain in my chest, and prickling in my entire body that I had never experienced before. I ended up in the hospital with what I thought was a heart attack, it was Angina. 

A few tests, a few blood samples, and a month later I was told I have 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', with coronary disease, and if I went without treatment my life expectancy would be ~50 years old. 

So yeah, that bj might have saved my life in the long run.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I gave chatgpt the text of the article and asked it to write an unhinged left wing critque of this policy. Here ya go:

Oh, look, the U.S. government has decided to slap a shiny “AI safety” sticker on its plan to hoard tech, screw the global south, and call it leadership. This isn’t about safety—it’s a corporate-backed imperialist power grab dressed up in buzzwords. No ethics, no worker protections, no democratic oversight, just a big ol’ “trust us” as they hand AI over to the same companies that gave us mass layoffs and surveillance capitalism. And "U.S. allies only"?! Translation: rich countries get the goods, the rest of the world can eat dirt. This isn’t a policy—it’s a roadmap to a techno-feudal hellscape where a handful of elites profit while the rest of us live under AI-powered oppression. Tear it up and try again, but maybe this time with less corporate bootlicking and more actual humanity.

Is it wrong?</div>

There's no way he would cancel the TRUMP order and deprive all these wonderful data centers of all that beautiful beautiful energy. So many gigawatts. People didn't think we could make the gigawatts, but we proved them _wrong_.</div>

It tells us nothing about the circumstances. What were the Israelis doing there. What were they shooting at? How did the child end up there? Why did the journalist end up being in the line of fire? 

99% of you clowns are probably too lazy to do some research because "Muuuuuuuuhhhh! Zionist!", so I did it for you.

First of all that dude was an activist for "Palestine". 

Second he was killed at  an incident where he built a "protest tent" on the middle of a street. His own actions provoked soldiers to fire shots and caused the situations where kids were in danger in the first place. He is responsible for creating the circumstances.

Third he was killed by an Israeli who isn't even Jewish or a "Zionist" and

Fourth that dude was sentenced to eight years for this by an Israeli military court. Can't imagine the same happening anywhere on the world with any other army in such a case - especially not the US.

So stop crying please.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The OP did pretty goodthey mentioned Palestine as independent, never mentioned religion good job

Palestine predates all modern religion there is no 2 state solution because both those states incorporate religion into their government

&gt;Commerce transcends the governed and the government



Also ironically depicted a British being shot by the isreal government, again no religion


Those who know their history might point to a 1918 piece of paper from Britain declaring support for a zionist nation but really that meant nothing until Hitler pulled Romel out of Africa core after massive Italy troops surrendered he had to devote significant resources then decided to invade the Soviet Union

&gt; As the Russian said no one asked them to come but then no 1 would let them leave




Hitler's removal of Ramo and resources from Africa core and northern Africa left significant deployments of British troops and resources with nothing to do they fell back on their 2 centuries honed technique


&gt;Never forget it was Palestine that destroyed itself 3 factions willingly fought against each other never bothering to speak and ask if Britain promised them the same piece of land if they fought each other</div>

the big money investing/pushing these tools forward obviously understands that

a) their own revenue and profits come from economic activity of wage earners and

b) the economic incentive for companies to use these tools lies in their ability to reduce labor costs,

This is what we’ve all been taught since grade school. We used to say, “freedom of speech,” and I’ve been bored to death for countless hours listening to my high school teachers and my college professors rant and rant and rant about the topic. 

Now we’ve taken the concept and turned it on its head. It’s like I don’t even know where to begin with my anger.</div>

Idk if that’s true but it’s what I believe. I don’t think any social media company should be beholden to the content moderation whims of the government. If you don’t like it you can start your own social media platform in a crowd-sourced way with other like-minded individuals and wealthy backers. If you’re less comfortable with unlimited free speech on social media then choose or create one that reflects that. I disagree with a “government gets to tell social media firms what to do because they’re so big they are ‘the public forum’” argument.</div>

Many people in the US do not realize how extreme our copyright rules have become; they're boiled frogs.  Oldsters remember that there was not always a DMCA, for example, and that it's introduction was a draconian change:

*...criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM). It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an access control, whether or not there is actual infringement of copyright itself.  In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet.*</div>

Op is "just" revealing company secrets which I find less concerning  compared to users using ChatGPT as therapist and thus revealing their innermost emotions, personal secrets and worst fears about them and their social circle to a for-profit company.

If this information was ever leaked it could lead to horrendous extortion and/or destruction of a lot of personal lifes.

This is really dark and OpenAI does not enough to educate users about it imo. Also they will sooner or later monetize on it. They have to because they need a ridiculous amount of expensive compute.</div>

Well, first I would like to say that I don't know if I put the right TAG. I found the new Tag options terrible. 


Lol. 


Second, I just found this on twitter. I don't know who this whistleblower is. Jesse Michel was the one who interviewed him:


"🚨🚨NEW FIRSTHAND UFO WHISTLEBLOWER


Randy Anderson is a Green Beret and an American Hero. In March of 2014, he was taken to an underground facility at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane in Indiana to a secure secret compartmentalized facility titled “Off World Technology”. He was shown an orb levitating above a podium and a "gauntlet" emitting holographic, hieroglyphic-looking text. This second object reportedly killed the person retrieving it. I have back-channeled with Navy contacts who say that while Wright Patterson reverse engineers the Air Force’s most exotic retrieved technology, Crane does this for the Navy.


Randy also STILL occasionally works contract jobs at Area51 and has seen “electrogravitic” antigravity triangle-shaped craft flying around the test site.


Randy’s credentials are beyond reproach: we have his DD214 as evidence of his service and his weapons training certificate from Crane proving he was stationed there. The implications of this interview cannot be overstated. Although in many ways (as he’ll admit), it begets more questions than answers. If anyone has had similar experiences or can add ANY insight on what Randy saw, please reach out to me or 
@UAPGERB
 (who introduced me to Randy) and is the best up and coming UFO researcher in the world right now. Go follow him. He’s going to be releasing some mind-blowing information in the coming months and years.


On a final note, I want to say that I had to personally convince Randy to do this — he was reticent to come out at all and extremely vigilant around not doing or saying anything here for self-gain. In fact, there was a section of my monologue dedicated to discussing his deployments and sacrifice for the country on the battlefield — he wanted that taken out. If we get any blowback for this piece (which I’m sure we will), it should be directed solely at me. Full episode in reply below." [Link](https://x.com/AlchemyAmerican/status/1878951513110052929)

They're not the ones with multiple homes, and many of them probably worked endless hours just to afford to live in Altadena, as opposed to the much wealthier Palisades suburbs.

I'm British and know fuck all about Cali, so it was nice to have that perspective explained to me by Brent Krystahl.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Absolutely. Drives me crazy when people politicize stuff like this. I disagree with how the majority of voters vote in many southern states, but I was 100% in favor of hurricane relief because it really isn't that difficult to be a decent person. 

Sadly, we live in a society that rewards people who see events like these and say "we need more vitriol, that's the answer." Even when red states were hit, there was still massive flood of disinformation, and hate. 

Don't have children, still support the child tax credit and lowering childcare costs. Paid off my student loans a decade ago, still support student loan forgiveness up to $40,000. 

We're stronger as a people when we're stronger individually, and punching down on those suffering weakens all of us.

Best of luck to you and yours with the recovery.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">As someone who lives in Los Angeles and drives through it and Hollywood every day for work, this is what I think: some twisted fucks heard the Santa Ana winds were forecasted to be more severe than usual. This is a perfect time to create mass fire chaos and destruction. Those fucks went to Malibu and intentionally set the fires. They may or may not have been motivated to punish the wealthy specifically. Or maybe just arsonists that love to set fires.  

With that said, I don’t disagree that actors are just props and fodder for the machine, but I don’t think it had anything to do with the elites or warnings from them. Towards other conspiracies, it could be the hedge funds and private equity firms wanting to swoop in on some very expensive real estate for cheap to take over those markets. They could have paid an arsonist.</div>

The Sunset fire, the one that would have set the Hollywood Hills alight, was put out before any structure damage. (Take that Hollywood elites!) 

It’s absolutely possible that arson was the cause of one or multiples of the fires and I’m sure there’s plenty of examples of mismanagement and whatever, but a lot of these conspiracies are stupid af.

If you were building a smart city you wouldn’t do it in a fucking canyon, on the jagged slopes of the Santa Monica mountains, or a rapidly eroding beachfront. The fact that we did and that the govt is fast tracking rebuilding by bypassing environmental review shows you we will in fact continue to live in dumb cities.</div>

The entire purpose of life is to enjoy yourself by gaming, social media, eating good food, etc. And the cheaper the pleasure, the better: I don't want to have to work hard to make a lot of money for pleasure. I'm not sure how you "get pleasure from every second", but you sound a little like those people who want employees to work 70 hours per week and worship their jobs. Evil!

The entire point of productivity is to get your work done as efficiently as possible so you have MORE time for pleasure. I think you've gotten it 100% backwards.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The problem is that the more you indulge to dopaminergic activities, the more you become tolerant to them: in the short term you are "happy" but in the long term it will result in you not being satisfied with some aspects of life or straight out frustrated with them.

One could go to that hedonistic path of life, but sooner or later it will cost you dearly. If what you want is long term happiness, then searching for it ALWAYS in short term pleasure is the wrong way: your brain will get more tolerant to the dopamine. 

On the other side, reading a book may not be the most entertaining thing in the world, but it makes me happy and gives me knowledge and memories that I can use for the rest of my life. I think one should search and adquirir taste for happinnes in the peace of fruitful activities: learning an instrument, talking with your friends, reading a book, etc.

But he's not worried because clearly AI is affecting the world much less than he thought years ago when he talked about mass technological unemployment and massive societal change... Because he has AI smarter than himself in o3 and nobody seems to care.

I think his reasoning is pretty off on that.</div>

When those weaknesses are overcome, it will be like adding the throttle pedal to a kit car. It didn't move fast before the final addition, but it leaves everyone in the dust afterwards.

                                <div class="reply-body">I think a lot of people, Sama included, thought that it would be a graduate ramp up in capability, where people would adopt AI for its current capabilities as it developed.

But that's not really how people or business work. Instead, I think of it more like a tipping point. There will be a point where AI reaches sufficient capability to do a *lot* of the work, all at once. It will reach some level of agency, reasoning, and long term thinking that suddenly, in one big flash, renders most tasks possible.

I don't think we're there yet, hence all the hype without so much adoption. It's also questionable how quickly each company will adopt it, if at all. That's the beauty of the free market: everyone isn't ordered to take the same risk at once.

But once things tip over into true agentic AGI, I believe that companies which adopt it heavily will very quickly gain market advantages due to increased efficiency, and the value will become undeniable. Eventually. Next year or two.</div>

Note that I’m saying *possible*, it would still take a ton of safety testing before any public release, not to mention how expensive it would be at first so it wouldn’t be economically viable to serve to the public until costs can be brought down. Even then, it would be heavily neutered just like the most popular AI tools we have today.

                                <div class="reply-body">American voters put tech CEOs in an impossible position.

America voted in a president who was well known to exact revenge against those who criticize him and to reward to those who glorify him.

If **you** were a tech CEO, what would **you** do?

If you criticize Trump publicly, you know some Trump-appointed toady will take revenge and screw your business.  Maybe you'll have to lay off 100 people or even shut down and lay off everyone.

**Would you speak your mind, knowing that others will suffer the consequences?**

Some government employees face a similar dilemma:  Say you voted for Trump or get fired:  [link](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/incoming-trump-team-is-asking-white-house-national-security-council-civil-servants-about-their-loyalty).

The American people elected a vicious narcissist.  That decision is going to force a lot of people to choose between principle and pragmatism in coming years.

The good answer was, "Don't elect Trump."  Now there's no good answer.  Just icky options.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">David does make a really good point about automation - a model that can do 70% of tasks needed for a job will be able to fully automate 0% of those jobs.

When a model approaches being able to do 100% of those tasks, all of a sudden it can automate all of those jobs. 

A factory doesn't produce anything at all until the last conveyor belt is added 

(Obviously a lot of nuance and exceptions being missed here but generally I think it's a useful concept to be aware of)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A very common mistake being made here is assuming that the tasks required to do certain jobs are going to remain static. There’s nothing stopping a company from decomposing job responsibilities in a manner that would allow a vast majority of the tasks currently attributed to a single human to now be automated. 

You don’t need a model to handle 100% of the tasks to start putting them in place. If you can replace 70% of the time a human is working, the cost savings are already so compelling, you don’t need to wait until you can completely replace that person as a whole, when you can reduce the human capital you already have by such a significant percentage.</div>
