                        <div class="comment-body">Good move! Deleting Instagram feels like escaping from a bad relationship—you don’t realize how draining it was until it's gone. I did the same thing a few months ago, and the difference is huge. Less comparison, no mindless scrolling, and way less anxiety. Reddit feels way healthier because at least here I can convince myself I'm learning something useful while scrolling endlessly. 😂 Congrats on taking back your mental health!</div>

Submission Statement: Lue Elizondo claims the new documentary “Age of Disclosure” premiering at SXSW tomorrow is intended to be the centerpiece to help drive disclosure in a way like never before.

For those not wanting to patronize X/Twitter:

Friends, by now you are probably aware of the upcoming documentary, “Age of Disclosure”. This secret project has taken over two and a half exhaustive years to complete and I am proud to have played a major role in its development.  I believe it has the potential to change the UAP conversation irrevocably.  

The Director is Dan Farah, the Executive Producer of Spielberg’s “Ready Player One”.  I am also proud to be joined by many senior officials, many of whom risked everything to tell you the truth, to include their political careers, their professional reputations, and even their safety.  

This documentary was intended to be the definitive center piece to help drive disclosure in a way like never before.  It has been an rollercoaster for all involved. 

Please join Dan and many others for the premier at SXSW Film Festival tomorrow.  I have a previous engagement that I cannot reschedule but know that I will be with every one of you, in spirit.  I encourage you to go see it and tell your friends.

I think people who meet you on your wavelength are smarter than most. They can talk about pretty much anything, with anyone. They’ll shoot the shit with some people, discuss politics with others, listen as well as talk, ask questions, but also will take time to explain things if they’re asked.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">In unfamiliar settings, highly intelligent people often repeat themselves in different ways -- at different levels.

First, they will offer the expansive big brain answer and hope to be questioned on it. If that provokes nothing of substance, they will retreat to refine the message in common terms without extraneous information. If that fails to land, they will meet the audience at their level and lead them towards understanding the concept being presented from the perspective of the audience. 

Intelligent people realize that effective communication requires reading the room and adapting the message to provide inclusive momentum. 

If the message isn't received, they words spoken are merely noise in place of opportunity. Intelligent people value their time and will not be inefficient like that. 

If the message isn't critical, they will move on to make an impression elsewhere to a more receptive audience. Intelligent people want to be questioned and challenged. This is what keeps the cycle of enlightenment and curiosity fueled. 

No inspiration = no motivation.

Very smart people often have a great sense of humor that they *don't* turn on others, but are willing to use generously to laugh at themselves.    

They also don't look for affirmations of their intelligence from others.  (It's pretty meaningless coming from most people and there just aren't that many people around from whom it *would* be meaningful.)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The relevant part:

&gt;”The experiments conducted by Kaspar Burger and his team show that the frequent occurrence
of DNA double-strand breaks causes excessive methylation of NEAT1, which leads to changes in the NEAT1 secondary structure. As a result, highly methylated NEAT1 accumulates at some of these lesions to drive the recognition of broken DNA. In turn, experimentally induced suppression of NEAT1 levels delayed the DNA damage response, resulting in increased amounts of DNA damage.
&gt;
&gt; NEAT1 itself does not repair DNA damage.
However, as the Würzburg team discovered, it enables the controlled release and activation of
an RNA-binding DNA repair factor. In this way, the cell can recognize and repair DNA damage highly efficiently.”</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I respect your insights, but I have to ask—what about the majority of us who aren’t in that ideal scenario? Your methods work great for a small, focused group, but many of us are dealing with burned-out neurotransmitters or ADHD-type challenges. It’s like an athlete giving tips on running faster while sitting in a wheelchair—not to be harsh, just pointing out that one size doesn’t fit all. We need advice that recognizes the diversity of work environments and mental capacities out there. For many, the perfect note-taking system or deep work session might not be achievable when your brain is already overtaxed by constant stimuli.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed. My recommendations come with assumptions that you work in corporate as an intelligence worker with fairly good mental state and  mild level exhaustion. But if someone  seeks solutions to productivity if brain is exhausted with stimuli, day to day is disturbed every minute with hundreds of tasks, I don’t think that person needs a productivity advise. This needs an evaluation of life choises, mental health and current state of affairs. This issues cannot be solved with some productivity recommendations.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think your "gut" is your subconscious picking up on a bunch of red flags you've experienced before (either in person or by proxy). Our brains are great at pattern recognition even when we're unaware it's happening. Don't trust your gut implicitly, but when it starts as you say, screaming at you, it's worth stopping to critically assess the situation.

Condolences for your loss...</div>

Like you eyes, ears and nose can pick up differences in sight, noises and smells that you might not be consciously aware of, because being hypersensitive to everything all the time would just overload you, but it can be enough to trigger a warning in your brain that something just isn't right and it's time for you to make a 180 and move the other way.</div>

A woman had a stroke that left her with a circle of darkness in her perception where she couldn’t see shit through it, but by doing some experiments they learned that while she couldn’t “see” through it, her brain still recognized objects placed in that blind spot without fail.

So much of what we “see” is only a fraction of what we really take in and absorb</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I read something that helped me (as a fellow anxious person). For a lot of people, anxiety is specific, whereas a gut feeling is generalized. 

Anxiety is usually about something specific. What if someone comes at me with a knife! What if what if xyz. Anxiety is focused specifically in front of you, visiting different scenarios. 

Gut feeling is general unease. You don’t know *what* you’re afraid of, but you feel that pull, telling you to avoid something. It pulls you away

Side note: I’ve been learning to listen to my body more. And for me, anxiety is tense shoulders. It’s a worry frown on my forehead, a fearful energy buzzing in my brain. And then gut feeling is a drop in my stomach. My brain is screaming, but around the scream, it’s quiet. My anxiety mind chatter shuts up, and my brain is just like, “LEAVE.”</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Hope this helps - trying to un-gatekeep how to get results like these:

(1) Create images in Flux

Use a variation of this prompt

A tilt-shift, wide-angle clay-motion-style diorama of Harry and Ron soaring in the tiny, handcrafted blue Ford Anglia, its clay-like wheels spinning mid-air. Ron, with freckles and messy red hair, grips the wheel in panic, while Harry, with round glasses and windswept black hair, leans out, his scarf jerking in stop-motion flickers. Below, the miniature Hogwarts Express chugs along, its stop-motion smoke curling unevenly. The sculpted sky, dotted with handcrafted clouds, shifts subtly, enhancing the storybook, clay-animation feel.

(2) Animate the images in a video gen tool - I used Minimax - Gave me the best results, people have also recommended WAN but I prefer Minimax’s output.

Make sure you mention stop motion animation. That’s what helps to sell the effect.

Use a variation of this prompt

Stop-motion style animation. A tilt-shift, wide-angle clay-motion-style diorama of Harry and Ron soaring in the tiny, handcrafted blue Ford Anglia, its clay-like wheels spinning mid-air. Ron, with freckles and messy red hair, grips the wheel in panic, while Harry, with round glasses and windswept black hair, leans out, his scarf jerking in stop-motion flickers. Below, the miniature Hogwarts Express chugs along, its stop-motion smoke curling unevenly. The sculpted sky, dotted with handcrafted clouds, shifts subtly, enhancing the storybook, clay-animation feel. The camera remains static, allowing the intricacies of the handcrafted world to unfold within the frame, inviting the viewer to immerse themselves in the whimsical, meticulously detailed scene.

I use https://app.playjump.ai/home - just easier to access all the tools in one creative suite - used to struggle switching platforms for each tool.

(3) Stitch them together in a video editor - (canva on chrome if you want the most basic editing done)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Everything with Kid Rock is contrived, he’s a chameleon.

Everyone knows by now, he’s a guy that grew up rich if not wealthy  in Michigan, whose father owned several car dealerships. 
Was into hip-hop as a teenager, wanted to be famous, so he bounced around for years making relationships and was just a hang around until he finally caught on. he was straight up hip-hop, that’s the music that was hot at that time and what he grew up with. 
He was able to do this early in his career, for as long as he did because his father supported him. 

He saw rock being crossed over with rap, and was smart to jump on it. in got crazy lucky in the late 90s at the very end of the MTV era with his first hit. 

That really started Peter out for him years later, so he flipped the switch once again, to redneck country.  
And if you’re going to break in with that crowd, you need to not like Donald Trump, but love him. 

Look at how fucking corny his stage shows were when he really started flipping to the whole redneck vibe? 
Giant fucking Trump flags, American flags, etc., etc.  
So obvious, corny but work like a charm. 

He’s still rolling with it, but he golfs several times a week, and flies around the country in a private jet.  
It’s what it’s paying the bills, today.  

So who fucking knows what type of music he even likes or is passionate about, if he’s passionate about anything other than making money.  
I don’t like him at all, I think he’s a piece of shit. But he is good at keeping his name in the newspapers, and he does this a variety of ways good pressed and bad it’s all intentional.  Now he’s dating Lauren Bobert, which is 100% just to keep his name out there. 
If he ever could’ve made money with hip-hop, he would still be rapping and wearing chains, breakdancing on stage, etc.

I ready lengthy interview with him in Rolling Stone, and he was a real fucking asshole doing a lot of of it. Part of that he seemed OK, but he drank a lot during the interview and was fucking obnoxious.  

Bill Maher, is just turning into angry old man , who yells at clouds and is only 18 months away from wearing a red hat if not sooner.  I used to think he brought a unique perspective to left leaning politics and Voice. He seemed to be to a certain degree, sane and rational.
But he just kept sliding into the swimming pool, with his toes first, then his foot, then up to his knee now he is about to slide into the deep end.  
But the shit that used to be witty that he said, is now just obnoxious and he sounds like a miserable Cunt.</div>

The Chinese will rather start producing chips at such absurd low prices that TSMC fabs (even if they are more advanced) will start losing customers. I give that scenario max 5 years.

BTW, mature chips are still the most important supply chain risk. By 2027, China could control nearly 40% of the world’s mature chip production.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">**ELI5:** Imagine you have a magic flashlight. But this isn't just any flashlight, this one can shine a super tiny, tiny light, way smaller than an ant's toenail. And we use this tiny light to draw on special pieces of glass to help make the little brains inside computers (aka microchips). These chips help run everything from your tablet to video games to your mom's phone when she’s ignoring you.

But here’s the problem: People want computers to be faster and smaller, and regular lights just aren’t small enough to make these chips better. So we use a super special kind of light called Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV, which is so tiny it makes normal light look like a giant whale flopping around in a bathtub.

So far, only one company in the world. ASML, from the Netherlands, makes the machines that use this special EUV light, and they’re basically the semiconductor gods. But NOW, China has built its own EUV machine, which is a huge freaking deal because the U.S. and its allies banned ASML from selling these machines to China. If this works, China won’t need ASML anymore, and that could shake up the entire tech world.

Okay, so how does this magic flashlight actually work? Well, making EUV light isn’t like flipping on a lamp. Oh no, my friend. You have to literally create a miniature sun inside the machine. ASML does this by shooting a high-powered laser at tiny tin droplets, vaporizing them into plasma hotter than the surface of the sun, which then releases the EUV light. Simple, right? No. It’s batshit insane.

BUT CHINA IS DOING IT DIFFERENTLY. Instead of shooting tin with a laser, they’re using Laser-Induced Discharge Plasma, (LDP), which is basically controlled lightning inside a gas-filled chamber. This method is an alternative to ASML’s Laser Produced Plasma (LPP) approach. In theory, it could be cheaper and easier to maintain, but in practice, it has a ton of challenges, like controlling plasma stability, preventing mirror contamination, and making sure the light is strong enough to actually etch chips.

AND HERE’S WHERE IT GETS EVEN DUMBER: EUV light is so weak that it gets absorbed by literally everything, even air. So you have to use vacuum chambers and super special mirrors called Bragg reflectors made of molybdenum and silicon stacked in 40-50 layers. And even then? You still lose 99% of the light. You are literally fighting the laws of physics just to get enough EUV light to hit the silicon wafer.

But if China can actually get this thing working, we’re talking about a complete game changer in global tech. Right now, the U.S. has been throttling China’s chip-making abilities by blocking access to ASML’s EUV tools. If China cracks EUV on its own, it no longer needs ASML, meaning they can produce next-gen chips without depending on Western tech. That would be a massive geopolitical shift in semiconductor dominance.

…Anyway, uh, yeah. Magic flashlight goes brrr.</div>

For anyone curious, there are some videos on YouTube from ASML themselves that show an animated simulation of the inside of the tool at work. 

And as a bonus fun fact, (which is probably outdated by now with the next gen High End EUV tools currently being installed.) The light produced by those tools is so precise, it would be like if you pointed your finger to the sky, and an Astronaut on the moon was hitting the very very tip of your finger with a laser pointer. 

Also also, every step of the Semiconductor process is petty fucking crazy. Truly, some miracle level technology goes into making your day to day life function.</div>

Now, I could be lazy and say this is proof that aliens built the pyramids, but no. I'm going in a different and more interesting direction.

To me, this hints that there were intelligent creatures on Mars. Guess what star is visible from Mars? Orion's Belt. Three stars. Three points. Just like the three pyramids of Egypt and the structures on Mars. So, I believe it’s possible that ancient Martian life was also inspired by Orion's Belt, just like the Egyptians.

**TL;DR:** Life on Mars and ancient Egyptians were inspired to build pyramids by the same constellations.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The pyramids don’t match origins belt. You have to mirror and flip the image 45 degrees to align to the pyramids. Further the absurd alignments of the great pyramid itself being so accurate and the alignments are way off for Orion’s Belt make this even more of a stretch. Over the thousands of years and even much further back it never aligns at all. It’s one of lowest effort comparisons thrown around. The Sphyinx potentially aligning with the constellation Leo and the head as such being a lions originally like Leo 20k years ago is dead on accurate though for alignment.</div>

So he's very optimistic. 


I wonder if that's correct.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It seems clear to me that test-time compute is another form of "scaling"- just like pre-training- where throwing more FLOPs at the problem leads to better results and greater intelligence. Unlike pre-training, though, test-time compute is more of an algorithmic improvement rather than a hard resource constraint like access to chips and power, which remain physical bottlenecks in the world of atoms rather than bits.

I think the metaphor of Type 1 and Type 2 thinking systems is fitting. Type 1 corresponds to "next-token prediction," while Type 2 represents more deliberate reasoning.

The broader question, to me, is when LLMs will develop "long-term," Type 2 memory. Once they do, it’s game over. They’re already super-intelligent in many ways—they speak dozens of languages, are expert coders, diagnosticians.—but they lack coherence over time. Once they achieve that, it's done-zo.</div>

My young son is really into space. I end up looking i to it more so I can teach him stuff.

One thing that blew my mind. Hard to explain but its the hubble deep field view. They zoomed into a dark spot of space and keep zooming into dark spots as more stars come into focus. Basically if you could see them all at once the whole sky is solid stars there's so many.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">These were taken with a Fuji camera in an extremely desolate part of Montana.  This sighting was less than a mile away from a launch control facility with 10 missile silos.  My brother in-law has a 2000 acre ranch next to it.  He took these photos and said he sees crazy UFO's like this all the time going back to his childhood.  He said he has a bunch of other videos and photos he would dig up for me.  I was pretty blown away with he quality of these pics.  I thought he was going to show me an orb or something lol.
