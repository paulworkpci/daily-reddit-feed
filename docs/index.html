The path to superintelligence is clear - you generate a huge amount of synthetic problems that are hard to solve but easy to validate.

And compute requires shittons of money to Jensen and power utilities.</div>

one for the daily stuff like work, groceries, home  
one for travel etc

I have a smartphone and a dumbphone and take either one with me based on what I need access to that day. I feel it's a great compromise and thought I'd share the idea.</div>

Incoming podcast excerpt:

So, you have cyber war, you have narrative war, then you have economic war. Something I've really never talked about publicly that we'll give you here on the show, is the one thing that they're (China) so good at is putting U.S. industry out of business. As you probably know, the generic drug business is almost 100% in China now. There are drugs that are absolutely mission critical drugs here like heparin for dialysis patients, and that's 100% made in China. 

They could just stop sending it to us, and we'd be in a real problem very quickly, but even worse than that is the people that are sequencing genomes here in the United States, let's say you go to 23andMe or you go to ancestry.com or you just want to pay to get your genome sequenced. There's a Chinese company called BGI that does the overwhelming majority of all the sequencing of U.S. genes. **There are other Chinese companies that are all the backbones of any of the U.S. genomic sequencing companies.** **China has the genomic sequence of every single person that's been gene typed in the U.S., and they're developing bio weapons that only affect Caucasians, which is crazy.** 

A genetic scientist that is a friend of mine, his name is David Mittelman, he works at a company called Othram, but for 25 years, he's been sequencing genomes. He's known in the business as one of the best in the world, and David has brand new equipment. He's been doing this his entire life, and he tells me that there is absolutely zero chance that someone can sequence a genome for less than 1,400 bucks or something like that ... I don't know the exact number, but the Chinese company, BGI will sequence your genome for 1,200 bucks. That's how they got all the business. Because they want that information. They can undercut every single company in the U.S. because it's state driven. This is how they put our aluminum business out of business. This is how they went after our steel business...

They subsidize businesses they want to take over, and they'll operate at an economic loss. We won't. We can't. So, we have to stop these things from happening.

Biological weapons that can target specific groups or individuals vulnerable to pathogens or other diseases are a growing national security concern, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said during a Tuesday speech on nuclear deterrence in Washington, D.C.

"Be careful who you send your DNA to," Richardson said at the event, hosted by the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. "There's a number of those companies where you can go and find out what your makeup is. That's a lot of information.

The U.S. government is surreptitiously collecting the DNA of world leaders, and is reportedly protecting that of Barack Obama. Decoded, these genetic blueprints could provide compromising information. In the not-too-distant future, they may provide something more as well—the basis for the creation of personalized bioweapons that could take down a president and leave no trace.

Get a Covid test at the peak of testing time?  Rumor was they were doing advanced testing of 5-10% of the swabs submitted, supposedly generic.  Plasma donation when you’re a poor college student?  Allergy testing?  Annual doc physical blood test?

Somehow the thought of a genetically targeted weapon spontaneously enters our mind and we all go... Nah I'm good. 

I've had more than 10+ IRL conversations where this exact idea comes up FROM the person I'm talking to. 

When I got a ancestry kit as a Christmas present, that was the immediate thought I had when I opened it to read how to use it, I put it back in the box and it's sitting in the same drawer 4 years later.</div>

Most people dislike walking, so Uber and Lyft take advantage of this and will charge you more to get a ride directly out of the area as a result. A solution I personally found is to walk as far away as you can from the touristy/popular area as possible before requesting a ride.

Releasing an AI video game (because anybody can release anything it doesn’t have to actually be good or profitable) has essentially already happened. Company run by AI is also guaranteed because again it doesn’t have to be a good one. Household robot is also a pretty safe bet but it will be stupidly expensive and not very useful.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Right. The “AI finds a cure for cancer” one in particular stood out to me. That’s not just a singular point of time thing and AI has already been used to find potential cures. They then need to be tested and go through clinical trials. So what really does it even mean? The invention of a drug that cures cancer (which we might not know for years or more) or the completion of a trial of a drug that was found years ago? Either way, it’s not really what the card is saying unless you interpret it in a very flexible way.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly. It is entirely unplausible that it is the chinese. First of all it would not be very strategic of them to fly around their fancy 100-year advanced technology over our Eastern seaboard for no reason. They are much more calculating and long game strategic than that. Secondly, it would be tantamount to a declaration of war at a time when they can ill afford it. This isn't china. The drones with the flashing lights are almost certainly next level DOD contractor stuff, with a degree of separation from our military forces for plausible deniability, in order to distract and obfuscate from the orange orbs violating our restricted military airspace. The orbs are the real story. These orange orbs are strikingly similar to those that have reportedly shut down our nuclear missile launch capabilities on several occasions. The orbs are the real story here. The drones are a distraction and a red herring.</div>

China can’t hide shit that big. The one recent sub they tried building sunk at its own dock. No way they are running subs long term 15,000 miles from home. They are a regional power. 

We would track those subs down in 30 seconds flat we have hydrophones all over the Atlantic and we have tracked Soviet subs for 60 plus years with them. Chinese active off our coast moving and launching drones would have a Navy destroyer following it.

                                <div class="reply-body">People just want an explanation. Myself included. But I am skeptical of all of these explanations.

If Chinese drones were invading my state for over a month I guarantee the U.S. would be shooting them down.

We shot the Chinese balloons down instantly.

People say we can’t shoot drones down or are somehow not willing to over civilian populations.

Anti drone tech exists that can bring them down without using explosives.

Even if it didn’t they would 100% be countering these.

If enemy fighter jets flew over NJ for a month you think the U.S. would just say “welp! They made it to a civilian populace. Guess we can’t shoot them down”

Complete bs.

This is either us black tech or it is NHI. 

Sorry - I don’t trust the word of some deranged dude who wrote a manifesto before killing himself and blowing up a car.

But it’s telling that so many do. Because our government has become a laughing stock of lies and greed and people would trust a used car salesman over anything our government says.

I also think it's way more likely that if heat signatures aren't observed it's because these drones have a method of cloaking them. It's not because they're using some engine that doesn't produce heat.</div>

It makes zero sense at all… Now what DOES make sense is running a propaganda blitz that makes there military tech sound much more powerful than it really is to Americans. Fly your “6th generation” jet out in the open while you start some rumors in America that they are flying drones out there, create a frenzy with bots, that spreads to the real people on the internet.

I’m sure this is just the first stage of the propaganda, be on the look out for a billionaire that is close to the president that is desperate for money and has ALOT of money tied up in China… 🤨</div>

If they put flying objects over America without them being able to stop it, that could guarantee America doesn't intervene I guess.

                        <div class="comment-body">Let me share an interesting perspective on this, drawing from both personal observation and historical context. Pre-smartphone era wasn't some magical time of deep focus - we just had different distractions. Picture someone in 1995 at their desk: they're probably doodling on a notepad, chatting with coworkers, checking their pager, flipping through magazines, or getting up for their fifth coffee run. The human brain has always been prone to wandering. What's fundamentally different now isn't our capacity for focus - it's the nature of the interruptions. Before, distractions were mostly passive (like a magazine sitting on your desk) or scheduled (like a TV show at 8pm). Now, they're active and random: notifications ping at unpredictable times, creating what psychologists call a "variable reward schedule" - the same mechanism that makes slot machines so addictive.

**Here's a telling detail:** libraries in the 1950s had signs asking people to be quiet - because people were talking and socializing instead of reading. Office workers in the 1980s would read newspapers, play with desk toys, do crossword puzzles, or gossip by the water cooler instead of working. Students in the 1970s passed notes in class instead of paying attention. The real shift isn't in our ability to focus - it's in the effort required to maintain focus. Before, you had to actively seek out most distractions. Now, you have to actively defend against them. It's like the difference between choosing to go to a party versus having a party randomly burst into your room several times an hour.

What we're nostalgic for isn't better focus - it's the ability to choose when to be distracted. The solution isn't to idealize the past, but to reclaim that choice in the present.</div>

I'm suddenly reminded of "WKRP in Cincinnati", station manager Arthur Carlson playing with his toy choo-choo trains in his office...

Things like movie theaters also strongly encouraged long attention spans. You couldn't pause. You couldn't rewind. You had to stay glued to your seat the entire length of the movie if you wanted to see it all, and if you got distracted, you missed part of it. 

TV was a little less demanding on the attention span, but there, too, you couldn't pause or rewind. There were commercial breaks every 10-15 minutes and it was a national mad scramble to go to the bathroom, get your snack, and rush back to the couch before the commercials ended. 

Couldn't pause or rewind radio, either. No VCRs yet, so no way to rent videos. 

I recall the movies and TV shows of the pre-internet era tended to be much slower-paced than the modern stuff. Example, Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West", and Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey". 

In the 1970s, that slow pace just added to the intensity of the experience, allowing you to absorb and ponder and built up the emotional experience of it.

Today, folks in their 20s consider both movies to be just too boring to watch because of their glacially slow pacing. 

MTV marks the beginning of the fast multi-shot editing style of 80s music videos, which spread throughout the movie and TV industry, which in turn was borrowed from the whip-saw editing of TV commercials, often 10-15 seconds in length and you had to capture an audience's attention in that time, and make it memorable.

People were just as distractable then as today; the tech of the time was just way less distracting than now. Packed far less machine-gun style dopamine hits.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is a great point specifically about the variable reward schedule.

But in addition to this, the experience within these applications are designed to trigger maximal dopamine responses. Things like infinite scrolling, pull-to-refresh (similar to slot machines), personalization, autoplay, time-sensitive content (stories, live broadcasts), "other people are typing", etc. 

It's sick and leads to dopamine receptor downregulation at an intensity that is really quite unhealthy to soceity.

Comparing media consumption between now and the 90s reveals several key differences in how content triggers dopamine responses:

90s Media Environment:

- TV shows came weekly, creating natural waiting periods

- Limited channels meant fewer choices and less constant stimulation

- Movies required going to theaters or waiting for VHS release

- News came primarily through daily papers or scheduled broadcasts

- Gaming consoles had physical limitations (cartridges, loading times)

- Music required physical media and dedicated listening time

Today's Media Environment:

- Instant access to virtually unlimited content

- Multiple streams of simultaneous stimulation (notifications, multitasking)

- Algorithmic content recommendation constantly serving dopamine hits

- Shorter form content (TikTok, Reels) providing rapid-fire stimulation

- Interactive elements (likes, comments, shares) adding social rewards

- Autoplay features removing natural breaks

- Personalized content targeting individual interests more precisely

- Higher production values and more sophisticated engagement techniques

- Mobile access meaning constant availability of stimulation

The key difference isn't just the content itself, but the:

- Speed of reward delivery (instant vs delayed)

- Frequency of stimulation (constant vs intermittent)

- Intensity of engagement mechanics (multiple vs single channel)

- Accessibility (always available vs time/place restricted)

This shift has made modern media significantly more potent at triggering dopamine responses, which can make older forms of media feel less engaging by comparison. This is particularly noticeable in younger generations who grew up with more intense stimulation patterns.</div>

o1 is better than me at:

* Creativity. It can generate more novel ideas faster than I can.
* Learning speed. It can read a dictionary and grammar book in seconds then speak a whole new language not in its training data.
* Mathematical reasoning
* Memory, short term
* Logic puzzles
* Symbolic logic
* Number of languages
* Verbal comprehension
* Knowledge and domain expertise ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I forget who said this, but someone mentioned if any human knew about as many things in as many separate fields as current AIs, they would be able to draw some impressive symmetries between different fields. As it stands the AIs don't seem very good at that. It's like they haven't ever really thought about what they know and how it relates to everything else they know at any more than a superficial level. 

IDK why I mentioned that, but I guess I already think the AIs are smarter than me in terms of raw brain power, but they seem to struggle applying their mental faculties. That's one of the reasons I think we're still missing some algorithmic advancement, and it may be something simple, it could just be scaling RL, or something else that's already been tried but just scaled up. Because if I had the faculties of an LLM I'd be a genius, but they seem to me like an undeveloped brain, one that loses coherence if left alone too long.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think this is why many people still think the original gpt4 was better. Because it was a giant model that was firing off lots more neurons for each request, giving it a deeper/more nuanced human feel to it's responses, even if it's performance on benchmarks is lower than current (smaller) models.


I suspect that the cross-domain thinking might be a emergent property and/or something that can specifically be trained for. Humans can be trained to do it. What if o3 was promted to generate millions of interdisciplinary metaphors or to spend millions of computer hours going through applying known techniques to distinct fields. Or looking at images and trying to draw parallels to different scientific and literary fields. Maybe a certain percentage of that data would create the connections/training data necessary for the type of "thinking" your talking about. Maybe! I wonder how there could be a benchmark for this... </div>

We know that with minimal information LLMs can build impressive world representations that are way more complex than you'd think. Just by being trained on moves of an unknown boardgame, it internally reverse engineered the complete rule set of the game, and had a "mental image" of how the game board looks like.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13382

Top-k sampling or whatever won't help you tho. These guys in the paper had to create a second AI basically measuring and mapping the internal connections of the LLM to visualize such a world representation. So who knows what you need to do to extract the really cool shit out of LLM. 

We know basically nothing about sampling and information extraction.</div>

You could do this if you downloaded Blender and spent a few hours with some YouTube tutorials. 


Most people can't beat Deep blue from the 90s at chess, but that does not make it more intelligent than them. Your ability to apply your intellect to nearly any task it what makes you smart. When an AI can do that better than you, it will be smarter.</div>

Instead of watching a YT tutorial, the AI was guiding the person by speech, telling them what to click and where, and explaining what results it would produce. It worked seamlessly through screen sharing, so the AI was able to see your screen.

                        <div class="comment-body">Unemployment is the goal, but mass poverty is not. We'll need to figure out a way to get money in people's hands, or change the economic paradigm. There will certainly need to be a new economic order, and it will be radically different from what we have now.

People talk about getting meaning from work, but no one gets meaning from 'do this menial job or you and your family are out on the street'.

When people don't _need_ to work, work is going to be a lot MORE meaningful. People will be doing it because they actually want to, and only if they want to, not because it's under threat of destitution.</div>

This implies ofcourse that we can't know what happens after it, because we're about to encounter unimaginable knowledge and tech at an incomprehensible speed. An intelligence explosion.</div>

Over 62% of the US jobs are white collar. If a large enough segment of those are eliminated then the economy will crash. We have no safety nets in place and it's a pretty safe guess that the vast majority of business owners and corporate board members are not going to be worried about the economic impact of replacing people with AI, just how it affects their profits today.</div>
