                                <div class="reply-body">For those without fluoride in your water, Portland folks included. Here is some advice from my dental hygienist and dentist. 

Don’t rinse out your mouth after brushing and spitting out the fluorinated toothpaste! My teeth were sensitive and my gums were receding. Then my dental hygienist told me not to rinse out my toothpaste with water. Just spit, wait 30 minutes to eat and drink. Voila. No more sensitivity. Don’t know if it could help anyone else, but my quality of life has significantly improved!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I just don’t get it. I live in a country with no fluoridated water. We just brush our teeth. When I see statistics comparing our oreal health to other countries we seem to always be kind of in the top.

Are other countries worse at brushing?

Edit: We also do not add fluor to our salt, beverages, food or other crazy stuff. You can buy toothpaste with fluor and dentists recommend that you do.

Edit edit: I looked into natural occuring fluor in drinking water and apparently 2/3 of the country have a high natural level of fluor in the drinking water, because of the underground composition. The 3 largest cities in the country are also placed within those regions. Those regions also have a high amount of calsium in the water and people outside this area have a much higher rate of Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth.</div>

All the conservatives are terrified to have much focus on this, just the fact that they were using Signal was violating the Federal Records Act because there is no permanent record of the communications. They will use any means they can to distract from that. 

I mean, even if it was hacked by a journalist with no technical expertise. What does that say about our enemies' ability to access our sensitive cabinet-level communications.</div>

If you can ask the same question in a different way and the answer would be wrong, then maybe it didn’t “understand”

You get my point?

My point is as a human, you rarely would suddenly loose knowledge/wisdom just cause your friend ask you to explain as as if you are a musician. 

But I agree. A lot of the work of LLMs are essentially replacing humans as a unique value resource of the economy. The are there or will get there in time</div>

The major anthropic paper this week shows llms do not simply generate the next token. Combined with whatever 'reasoning' is (which is not reasoning), these things are becoming more and more alien.

Like they get the right answers most of the time, and increasingly we don't know why. When we ask them to explain, it is unrelated to what actually happened. And furthermore, the latent space that goes beyond language based tokens continues to rise so we go beyond human comprehensible capability at all.

                        <div class="comment-body">The idea that LLMs are "better" at some field than humans just because they score higher on a relevant benchmark needs to die.

If someone makes a mistake they can learn from it and avoid it in the future. LLMs can often do that as well, but only within their current context window. Imagine how frustrating it would be to work with someone who would need to be reminded every day that things have to be done in a particular way.

Until LLMs can persistently learn from feedback without losing unrelated capabilities or changing their behavior in unexpected ways they can't be trusted to work autonomously in a general setting. They will be relegated to work as assistants or on narrowly defined, essentially repeatable tasks.</div>

Here is my submission statement for this post. On Dec 17 2024 I found a connection between whats believed to be drone swarms partially detected by radar from a Youtuber who is linked on the post on X, to the live Gamma Radiation website provided in the description of the post on X. Im here for scientific discussion, speculation etc, not to claim this is 100 percent what happened. If youd like screenshots of all the coastal radiation anomalies of the time please DM me.

Normally I would just be happy about it since I’m an investor - but this sub has turned this shit into team sports. 

So given this is the FIRST EVER time that objectively Google is in the lead —- all categories as well as context price and speed —- it’s worthy of a post lmao

Cheap tricks like Ghibli memes stealing the spotlight may work in the short term but no one can deny the game has fundamentally changed.

We know GPT5 is imminent, o3 which they showed in December is slightly better than Gemini 2.5 and will probably be better than it was in December when it finally launches. Also it's Anthropics public policy to sit on models and only release them when the competition release a comparable model as they claim that they dont want to drive an AI capability race.

Sleep affects mental abilities, discipline, motivation and mood directly. 

Bryan johnson did a study on kernel showing how he was unable to resist temptation on lack of sleep. Sleep makes you a high performer and its essential to become a 'professional sleeper' as he calls it. Identify as a sleep athlete.

                        <div class="comment-body">Not saying Zegler’s comments didn’t have any impact on the film’s box office or critical reception but how about make a better movie and maybe there will be more interest?

Gal Gadot’s performance was comedy, terrible writing, color grading/green screen looked like ass and the CGI dwarves looked fucking horrifying. 

Also why was the main love interest wearing a hoodie in a movie set in medieval times?

I would say Zegler’s performance was one of the better aspects of the movie (and she wasn’t good either)

edit: I straight hate live action Disney princess movies, they are just lazy corporate cash grabs but at least Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast was somewhat whimsical and fun? This movie was just drab and lifeless. Mulan was decent and haven’t seen The Little Mermaid yet</div>

As a general rule, one side in these culture wars doesn't get a choice about their engagement with it. If you're the "undesirable" side of the debate, you have skin in the game whether you like it or not, whatever your degree of political awareness. It's politically immobilising for that reason.</div>

However, your message is particularly for the right side since they are the ones who seem to actively support the powers that be and carry out their dirty work of actually attempting to genocide certain sectors of society. The far right will always be a tool of the wealthy and of the state which is owned by the wealthy, always have been. 

I would love for them to see how they’re being manipulated, but until then the far left will have to continue helping as a defense for society’s most vulnerable. 

And yes, those factions are perfectly capable of defending themselves, they are just outnumbered.</div>

nah you would think its that easy but they literally say braindead loser stuff like "we are made in gods image so if someone says they are a different gender than their genitals they are attacking my god." we as a race are cooked because so many believe in objective fiction- that their gods and only their gods exist and care about them</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's actually pretty limited compared to Dall-E. I've been trying to get it to reproduce stuff like a Pixar style, which Bing does with ease, and with bright saturated colors and deep blacks, but with Sora, everything is either photorealistic, or Ghibli, but even the photorealisitc stuff isn't, in that the colors are very muted and you don't get deep blacks. I have seen some good results if people post-process in photoshop to correct the tone though.

I wonder if something in their rule set is affecting the quality of the images. They're much more restrictive than Bing was too. Bing would happily make a Pokemon even if it got it wrong most of the time, but ChatGPT and Sora simply refuse, even if you're just trying to get it to make an image of a pokemon more detailed. It figures out what it is and refuses.</div>

My gf in moscow just send me pictures of this "thing" over her house.
She said it was high up in the sky and kinda reminded her of a flying doll.
She couldn't hear any noises.

She couldn't take clear images since it was really high and taking a photo fully zoomed in with bare hands is kinda difficult.

Its prolly some sort of drone but what drone looks like that?</div>

Social media isn’t the root of the problem. Just like heroine isn’t the root of a drug addicts problem. 

But a drug addict isn’t going to quit and recover with a baggie of heroine in their pocket.</div>

I am not here to whine about it. But the problem is, even though I can't contribute in that sub, I still keep visiting that sub and watch other people's posts and comments. It is pathetic. Imagine going out with a group of friends but you aren't allowed to speak and you can only hear them talk. That's what it feels like.

                        <div class="comment-body">Hi there - 

I was unfairly banned from a Discord and found it to be a completely heartbreaking experience. It was not one where I could re-join from a fake account, because then I would have to participate from a fake persona and not get to be myself. I was there to build authentic community, and the mods said crappy things about me that turned the people who I thought were my friends against me. I lost all of them and the whole thing.

So, I am really sorry this is happening to you. I know how painful it can be. 

That said I do agree with the other commented who said you can make another account, if you want.

But I understand if you don't.

So what I would suggest is to take the time to grieve the loss of that sub and community, and recognize that you have a habit of participating on it during your downtime and think about what you can replace that ritual with.

For example, if you normally check the sub at X time, instead, call a loved one, walk outside, do 10 jumping jacks, or sit down with a cozy book. 

So make a list of 1) times you check the sub and 2) activities you'd like to switch to

It will take time because your brain is trained to go there.

I'd also suggest trying to find a way to participate locally with people who share that interest, perhaps by starting a meetup group that talks about something similar to the sub.

Finally, give yourself time. Let yourself feel the grief and anger. 

Maybe even try a 30 day cleanse with tons of replacement activities, knowing it will be hard at first, but that on the other side you might realize you didn't need the sub at all. Good luck :)</div>

If google gives us gemini 2.5. pro for free...wow...and lol to all paying claude and gpt users.

And then dont forget about LLaMa.  The "3.3" model is not bad, but im sure there is more to come. Open source and free</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Funny enough, I was actually one of those people. I grew up on computers, so before Google Chrome was a thing, I used to just type in google.com and the address bar on Internet Explorer. Once I switched over to Google Chrome later down the line, I had no idea you could actually use the address bar as Google search, because I just download it on a whim because my classmates were praising it. Low and behold, it took me until late middle school until one of my friends told me “you know you can just type your search in the address bar right? “And my mind was blown. Even after he told me that, because of force of habit, I still went to google.com with the address bar for like a year after that, but I’ve since corrected my ways. Just to give you a little bit of insight. 😆</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Sociopaths have a much higher than average chance than others of becoming a CEO. At the very least Altman is Machiavellian, it’s hard to achieve what he has by being a decent human being. Being a compulsive liar and self serving likely got him where he is in life.

On the flip side if he was a more decent human being he probably would have been easy to manipulate by Elon. According to the emails they released Ilya was ready to fold when Elon tried to grab control of Open AI and Sam resisted.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think that highlights how humans are more easily influenced by appearance and messaging than then they believe they are. Narcissistic sociopaths seem very secure and confident on the surface but are deeply insecure when you peel their outwardly facade away. They have a need for validation and control and often try to get to positions of power and prestige. 

People are often amazed by how "confident" and "capable" they seem to be while not being able to tell that it's all surface level. It's mostly a facade. So these people get to positions way above where they should be.

Meanwhile regular people are realistic or slightly pessimistic about their own capabilities that they often never try to get to these positions or aren't overly confident and aren't able to convince people to hire them for high level positions.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Ilya Sutskever and Mira Murati actually signed the petition to bring back Sam along with every other employee. So it was their plan then they immediately folded. The article says that Ilya apparently thought people would cheer when he told them Sam was getting fired but it went the complete opposite way, the employees started thinking it was a coup by Ilya and a few others and that Sam was being unjustly fired. 

I have no idea why Ilya thought he could outmaneuver Sam in a game of office politics</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; They were all liars and manipulators to some extent.

Source on the other members of the board being “liars and manipulators”?  There were no examples in the article.

I think Altman comes off looking much, much worse than the original board.  As far as I can tell, the only thing the board did wrong was fail at politics.  Altman lied about an awful lot of important things and tried to manipulate people who opposed his agenda.  The board’s decision to fire him was the only sane response to a CEO that won’t be honest with his own board about what their company is doing; the board just had terrible execution.

I don’t really understand why you sound *ambivalent* after all this.  The way I see it, an unscrupulous liar won against four people who actually believed in OpenAI’s original mission.  I don’t like that this person might end up in charge of the most powerful technology humanity will ever discover.</div>

With the scale of the stakes (as they see them), it's surprising things haven't gotten even uglier.
