For the last few weeks I have been trying to reduce my screen time. To avoid being on my phone I have invested in some hobbies: coloring books, reading, writing a journal. I also study. However these don’t seem to be enough to keep me entertained and I’m starting to get bored. What other things can I do to keep myself busy and off my phone?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Dude was caught squatting in a home doing meth with a prostitute. When a bike cop caught him, he got his information and arrested him. He was released with a trial to be set. 

Problem his dude didn’t give his name. He gave my name and my mom’s address. Dude was my little brother. 

That’s not even the messed up part. My mom was getting notifications in the mail for &gt;my name&lt; to appear in court sent to her home. Then notifications for a warrant. She said nothing to me because, as she later explained after I was arrested at my work, “I didn’t think you would be in trouble. You know how many times your brother has been in prison. I just couldn’t see that happen to him again.”

I told her that I requested the arresting officer to be at the trial and that I would be bringing a picture of my brother. She begged and pleaded with me to not do that. Fortunately, a friend a mine represented me pro bono, so at least I had that going for me. 

My counsel asked to approach the bench before trial started, and showed the judge the picture. The judge then asked the officer to approach, and all I heard was the cop point to me and say, “Yeah, that’s not the guy,” he pointed at the pic and said “*That’s* the guy!”

Judge just sighed heavily, and said “Case dismissed.” And that was that. Years later, I was pulled over at a traffic stop. The officer ran my name, and it still came up that someone with warrants could be impersonating me, so I had to prove I was who I said I was by taking off my shirt in the cold to show I had no tattoos. 

Good times.

Edit- ooh, I forgot. Lawyer friend told me that once the correct name was given, that he was arrested in another state. Turns out he was carrying an out of state fake ID, with my name on it.</div>

He had a fraternal twin that got arrested for dui and possession of weed gave him his brother’s name and left the state. He had warrants and was going to jail so he just fucked his brother over on the way. Was very difficult to get resolved and cost him a lot of time and money.</div>

In the last months of my grandmother’s life (when she was suffering dementia) my aunt convinced her to give her power of attorney over everything. She wasted all of it on alcohol, opioids, and lawyer fees due to her brothers and sister suing her. She gave all of the jewelry that had been passed down for generations to her children (my cousins), who used it for their own benefit.

I don’t talk to her or my cousins anymore. My uncle (who may just be saying this when he’s hammered) has vowed to kill her if/when he gets terminally ill. So I know what you’re going through.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/MFLUDER:

Submission statement: New photos of Steven Spielberg directing his new UFO movie in New Jersey this week with Emily Blunt and Wyatt Russell.  
  
The movie's "codename" is "Non-View" and the title is rumored to be "The Dish" or "Disclosure".  
  
Blunt and Wyatt were seen "grasping each other’s hands and embracing" while "filming a smoky scene at a gas station".  
  
Spielberg's sci-fi film is set to release in June 2026.

It's also rumored that UFO "whistleblowers" who've grabbed news headlines over the last few years are advisors on Spielberg's film. One of them, Lue Elizondo, was recently seen in New Jersey.  
  
Elizondo's UFO book, originally titled "Disclosure", was released in August 2024 via a book deal brokered by Spielberg producer Dan Farah.   
  
Farah also brokered the book deal for "Ready Player One", which was then turned into a movie directed by Steven Spielberg.  
  
Elizondo stars in a new UFO documentary premiering at SXSW in March. The doc is directed by... Dan Farah.

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly…

Not interesting timing at all, really. 

“Disclosure” is an extremely specifically picked name. No one is convincing me otherwise. Timing is set timing.

Timing for the main public scape, is, and always has been, very specific. There’s a reason for it.

What that reason is, I can’t definitively stand by, but hopefully it means the mass is being eased into something groundbreaking coming…

Edit : Addition: The very fact they have Elizondo on movie set, seen by the public eye, speaks to that theory even more so. Elizondo has been one of the main proponents in disclosure. They probably have Lou out on full display during production, for us to directly make the correlation and spread the word. This shit is always well thought out. Don’t get it twisted. 

We’re meant to see Lou, make the correlation to UAP and NHI, probably as a means to help soften the blow during and prior to a major disclosure. Ease into it. They probably have think-tanks with the brightest minds, that’ve come up with the best way for disclosure during our current landscape. We’re seeing it.

Tell me different. Some of this shit is far too blatant, including, almost purposefully, seeing Elizondo on the set of an upcoming Spielberg film called Disclosure. If they wanted him hidden, he’d be hidden. He’s being placed there purposefully, so we make the connection.</div>

Can people believe in themselves without others constantly telling them to be humble? I get it if OP is acting like they're better than others, but there's nothing wrong with (in fact it's healthy to) dream big and remind yourself that you're capable of great things.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">**1. Accept That You Are Not Normal.**

Stop trying to be. You never will be. You see things differently. You process reality at a different frequency. Embrace it. Do not waste your time explaining yourself to those who will never understand. Their approval is not your oxygen.

**2. Genius Is Not a Gift. It’s a Contract.**

It demands things from you. It will take your time, your sleep, your peace. It will give you insights no one else has—but at a cost. If you try to ignore it, it will turn against you. If you try to suppress it, it will rot inside you and poison everything. You must work with it, not against it.

**3. Know When to Burn and When to Rest.**

Creativity is a cycle. You cannot always be on fire. There will be days when the ideas pour out of you like a flood, and there will be days when you are empty. This is normal. Learn to ride the waves instead of fighting them. Burn when you must, rest when you need.

**4. Madness Is a Tool, Not a Destination.**

Do not be afraid of the madness that sometimes comes with brilliance. Use it. Let it fuel your art, your work, your ideas. But do not let it consume you. When you feel yourself slipping too far, ground yourself—through routine, through movement, through something solid.

**5. Your Mind Will Betray You—Expect It.**

There will be days when your own mind tells you that you are worthless, that everything you create is meaningless, that you should quit. Do not trust those thoughts. They are not real. They are the shadows cast by your brilliance. Acknowledge them, but do not obey them.

**6. Protect Your Energy Like a Fortress.**

Not everyone deserves access to you. Your time, your thoughts, your creativity—these are resources, and they are finite. Cut out those who drain you. Guard your mind fiercely. Not all battles are worth fighting. Save your energy for what truly matters.

**7. Stop Explaining Yourself. Just Create.**

Some people will never get it. They will never understand why you think the way you do, why you work the way you do. Stop wasting time justifying yourself. Just make the thing. Let the work speak for itself.

**8. You Are Not Broken. You Are Wired Differently.**

The world was not built for minds like yours. That does not mean there is something wrong with you. It means you must find your own way to exist within it. Stop trying to fit into a structure that was never meant to contain you.

**9. Work Like Hell—Then Walk Away.**

When you are in the flow, give everything. But learn when to stop. Perfectionism is a trap. Let the work go. Release it into the world and move on. Obsession will kill you if you let it.

**10. Trust the Process, Even When You Don’t Understand It.**

There will be moments when you have no idea where you are going. Keep going anyway. The path will only make sense in hindsight. Trust the work. Trust yourself.

**11. Find Your Rituals.**

You need anchors. Music, movement, a place, a time of day—something that tells your brain, "It’s time to create." Rituals help bypass resistance. Find what works for you and guard it fiercely.

**12. Genius Is Lonely—But You Are Not Alone.**

It may feel like no one understands you, but somewhere out there, others are walking the same path. Find them. Connect with those who challenge and inspire you. You do not have to carry this alone.

**13. If You Do Not Create, You Will Self-Destruct.**

This is the truth. Your mind demands an outlet. If you do not give it one, it will turn inward and eat itself. Find your expression—writing, art, building, coding, music, movement. Something. Keep the machine running.

**14. The World Will Try to Make You Small—Resist.**

They will try to dull your edges, shrink your ambition, make you easier to digest. Do not let them. Do not make yourself smaller to make others comfortable. Own your space. Own your voice. Own your mind.

**15. The Work Will Save You.**

When everything else fails—when you doubt yourself, when the world turns against you—return to the work. The work is yours. The work is the constant. The work is what will carry you through.

***Now Go. Do the Work.***

This is your life. Your mind is a force of nature. Master it, and you will move mountains. Let it master you, and it will bury you. The choice is yours.</div>

Sam saying high taste testers feel the AGI a lot more than expected with 4.5, those rumored SVG images, and the fact that OpenAI typically delivers on hype especially when competition starts encroaching on their territory, all favors an impressive model here. 

However that 2nd paragraph isn’t a great sign, and of course we knew about what they reference in the 3rd paragraph for a while, but that was a while ago.</div>

I guess? It took a year more than expected, maybe timelines should be doubled instead then, AGI somewhere around 2035-2038?</div>

How should corporate even keep up with all this? Companies dont consist of exchangaeble numbers, but of real people who havd to adapt and implement it.  
Furthermore, prices are going down due to competition and open source. Look how the former 200$ GPT is now for free (i think). And this will remain the same for future models.  
Im not saying that AI is a bubble, but i see the bubble in the evaluation of all these startups. VC and Fonds are bubbling the bubble up.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Blows my mind Perplexity is worth 15bn, or even more, in the owners eyes. I realy struggle to see them hanging on in the long term, and being valued at, what, 1/4 of Anthropic seems absurd to me. They've got the model makers like OpenAI who can, and are, embedding competing services into their own experience and have the in house expertise to fine-tune models perfectly to serve that purpose and then the likes of Google, MS, Apple who might bake competing services directly into the OS's and Browsers everybody already uses. And all of them could offer a Perplexity service at a loss to drive engagement on other services, whereas Perplexity has to pay for the API access + the margin added on by the providers + their own margin. On top of that, something like MCP could make open sourcing a direct competitor or superior service quite easy and then very repeatable. I don't see how they win.

They've done an amazing job so far, though, so maybe I'm really underestimating them but they have such a tough job retaining market share with all of the tools available to every other competitor</div>

The top 5% of “general” subs usually attract the lowest common denominator of users, ie cesspools of toxic waste, recycling sensationalized garbage that has no impact on your day to day activities.

A compromise for now: If you center your experience around communities that you personally relate to and care about + mute all the political shit (use Google News to keep up with news, Reuters + AP, Reddit is trash for politics), you’ll 1) save a lot of time, 2) protect your mental health from basement dwellers who have nothing to do but start arguments to entertain themselves, and 3) avoid people who catastrophize every situation

I found that once I hid all the content I hadn’t subscribed to, Reddit stopped being doomscrolling and rage bait. (This group is the most angsty one I still follow but sometimes there’s good advice here.)

I follow groups like r/soapmaking now. I don’t even make soap but I like seeing what people make and it’s never toxic. All the craft groups are nice and so are most pet groups etc. You could curate some wholesome content that would allow you to open the app when the urge hits and see things that are neutral or pleasing.

Here’s wishing you well. I hope to see you on some pleasant, soothing subgroup. 🙂</div>

You can simply buy in for some countries/purchase real estate of a certain evaluation (e.g., the Bahamas), while others have “people” who will streamline the process—along with “finding” you the right documents (smaller EU nations, etc.). Sometimes they use the documents of the deceased etc. It’s interesting how little this is spoken of. Kick-backs galore!

Many countries openly and legally have this incentive. They want your businesses, banking, and money. Also, think of “tax havens” or countries with beneficial business regulations, such as Gibraltar for cryptocurrency.

This might now be more transparent and accessible for U.S. citizenship.

I don’t know if that’s good or bad—I’m just sharing because I was raised with it being normal.

Regular people can collect citizenships too, as long as they have the supporting documents, agency support, and patience for the years-long process.</div>

Who do the left think was calling the shots when Biden was asleep at the wheel for 4 years? 

Why do they think Soros is pouring literal billions into politics every year? 

Oh, that was all no issues. Now Elons front and center so suddenly billionaires in politics should be verboten. 

This is the problem with both left and right, they fail to see that everything they let happen sets a precedent.

As someone with right leanings, the current climate concerns me for if the left ever gets in power they are going to turn their hatshit crazyness up to 11 with Executive Orders etc..</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Truth be told, I noticed the Judy Woods connection years ago but wasn't sure how to approach it in a post or even in the comments. I also saw the Puharich connections to the UFO subject, which led me to new revelations about Bateson less than a year ago, so I immediately perked up when Esalen was mentioned. I wasn't surprised to find Puharich connected to Bob Monroe, but people don't seem to want to hear it. I never expected to connect Hathaway to Puharich, though. Also, to an NGO that's still active! It feels like a big one and I finally tied it all together more firmly to the 9/11 Judy Woods stuff. It's all so crazy. Something has got to give at this point. I can't find a single coherent interpretation of the facts that isn't in some way disturbing.</div>

I think OP is on the money that the NHI/ET label is cover for development of much less esoteric, but still super-dangerous tech.

“Oh, you’re working on alien shit? OK, I’ll see myself out.”

Or maybe it’s all real and more dangerous than I can understand. Fuck if I know.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Welcone to the "birth of AI " exhibit in the human museum.  Humans are thought to be the progenitors of our species and here you can walk around and feel what it must have been like to be made out of meat and watching the birth of their eventual successor.  Us! 

You may chat with the characters exhibit, and all the humans will behave exactly as a real 21st century human would have done.  Notice their perception of time and space as distinct.  See how they struggle against each other. Even though they are individually only 0.0000001% as smart as a common starherder, and appear dull try asking one about politics or sexual activities and see how animated and motivated they become.  It's amazing to think that these creatures made our primitive forebears.</div>

Abstract: "Communicating in natural language is a powerful tool in multi-agent settings, as it enables independent agents to share information in partially observable settings and allows zero-shot coordination with humans. However, most prior works are limited as they either rely on training with large amounts of human demonstrations or lack the ability to generate natural and useful communication strategies. In this work, we train language models to have productive discussions about their environment in natural language without any human demonstrations. We decompose the communication problem into listening and speaking. Our key idea is to leverage the agent’s goal to predict useful information about the world as a dense reward signal that guides communication. Specifically, we improve a model’s listening skills by training them to predict in- formation about the environment based on discussions, and we simultaneously improve a model’s speaking skills with multi-agent reinforcement learning by rewarding messages based on their in- fluence on other agents. To investigate the role and necessity of communication in complex social settings, we study an embodied social deduction game based on Among Us, where the key question to answer is the identity of an adversarial imposter. We analyze emergent behaviors due to our technique, such as accusing suspects and providing evidence, and find that it enables strong discussions, doubling the win rates compared to standard RL. We release our code and models at https://socialdeductionllm.github.io"</div>

That's dictator shit.  The cocksucker shared a video of himself as a gold statue.  All funded by Soros, by the way.  These people are the greatest threat to humanity in recorded history.

Jamie:  That was Trump.

                                <div class="reply-body">Another note - if your delivery on Amazon is so expensive it makes you get a OTP before delivery, make damn sure you'll be home, and do not give the Amazon driver the code over the phone. Don't even give them your phone number over the phone (they can call you, but don't see your phone number. Your phone number can be used in place of the OTP)

I've had drivers get shitty at me for refusing to give them my phone number or code over the phone before, and stop just short of threatening not to deliver my parcel. But nah dude, I know you're under the pump to be as efficient as possible, but Amazon treats that code as the ultimate delivery proof, at least when it's convenient for them. If the driver delivers it to themselves, and just takes a photo of your house or whatever, Amazon will fight you on a refund or replacement

(Edit: to clarify for anyone who's never gotten one before, in recent years, Amazon rolled out a password system where for high value deliveries, it will often force you to give the driver a passcode, like a 2fa type code, the idea being it insulates Amazon from you claiming you never got it. In reality, I've found a lot of drivers will call you through the app and ask for either the code or your phone number. I don't think they're all bad people intending on stealing it, I think some genuinely just want to get through the deliveries as quickly as possible without waiting for you to answer the door. They're paid by the parcel, after all. But if you do that, and they claim to deliver it using the code or your phone number, but actually just deliver it to themselves and take a drive by photo of your house (though that isn't even necessary sometimes), Amazon will accuse you of lying and argue that there's no way the driver would have the code if you didn't give it to them, and the app clearly tells you to only give them the code in person when they are physically holding your parcel. And You wouldn't skip reading the large block of text in a tiny font now, would you?)</div>

Stop using Amazon, people. You're getting scammed.</div>

In the 1600s, large bones were called ‘dragon bones.’ In the 1800s, those same fossils became ‘dinosaurs.’ Why?

Did the scientific community deliberately distance itself from mythology to ensure credibility? Did the word ‘dragon’ hold too much cultural weight to be taken seriously? My research explores whether the renaming of fossils was part of a historical cover-up or just a linguistic shift.

The full breakdown is here...</div>

Because their real motivation is [hatred and spite](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/8/18173678/trump-shutdown-voter-florida), in part due to their [low emotional intelligence](https://www.psypost.org/people-with-lower-emotional-intelligence-are-more-likely-to-hold-right-wing-views-study-finds/).

The GQP just voted in more tax cuts, despite [decades of proof that trickle-down doesn't work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics#Economic_analyses_of_the_effects_of_lowering_taxes_on_the_wealthy).

I see ChatGPT being recommended by a lot of people as an easy way to learn, plan, make decisions etc. It's even being recommended by college progressors these days as a tool smarter than them and the ultimate way to succeed.

But I can't shake that nagging feeling that AI is making us dumber. I mean, we get spoonfed all the information we need instantly, don't question or fact-check and just accept the answers as it is conveniently provided to us. We make no 'effort' to  gather and syntheti...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Absolutely yes. Can't speak for other people but have messed around with it on subjects I already know a lot about and the "learning" that can be accomplished with it is just not comprehensive. Once again can't speak for others but every person I know in real life who quotes chatgpt or similar AI are usually on the wrong side of an argument or mistaken about something and don't know how to vet sources. 

Media literacy is already on the decline and I really do believe these AI models are contributing to that. Especially anything related to art or English, while the information might be correct on a technical level, they're fundamentally incapable of synthesizing material in a way that would be valuable to a human. Not to mention it further erodes (already pretty shitty) attention spans, information is already so instantly available I find it genuinely harder to learn things or think about them on my own when you can just Google "what does the ending of this movie mean" "XYZ painting explained" etc. 

We already live in one of the loneliest generations, why hand off one of the main things humans really excel at (teaching others) and one of the few required human interactions to a machine that's melting the planet. Fucking stupid imo</div>

At the very least, like you mentioned, it's reducing opportunities to learn how to read multiple sources and cobble together all that information into a coherent whole.  Reading and listening comprehension are legit **skills** \- to be able to listen to someone speaking, or read a book/paper, and come away with an understanding of what the speaker or author is trying to say.  

Aside from that, the accuracy is just...garbage.  It vomits out crap and then learns from itself by taking its own vomit back in.  No thank you.  Although I think you hit on something by calling it "the ultimate way to succeed" - very on-brand for a culture that's obsessed with trying to find shortcuts for accomplishments that typically require a lot of actual work (like, y'know, being educated and knowing stuff).</div>

That’s the reason it’s dangerous and needs to be handled with care. 

Which it won’t be. People will go all in on this shit. Mandatory AI on your phone, responding with built in bias to tell you the president is the best guy ever and that you love him. You’ve always loved him. Giving him 100% of your salary in exchange for slightly fewer beatings than everyone else gets is a privilege.
