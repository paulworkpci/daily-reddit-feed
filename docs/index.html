"The awards to Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI – each with a $200M ceiling – will enable the Department to leverage the technology and talent of U.S. frontier AI companies to develop agentic AI workflows across a variety of mission areas.  Establishing these partnerships will broaden DoD use of and experience in frontier AI capabilities and increase the ability of these companies to understand and address critical national security needs with the most advanced AI capabilities U.S. industry has to offer."

It's actually awards of up to 200M for the 4 frontier labs. Pretty interesting.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">What can they possibly add now?

The ZR1X has flat crank V8, twin-turbos *and* electric motors, and aero and tires that’s pushing the limit of a road car.

Maybe they meant they’d do a track-only model like the old XX program of Ferrari?

Edit: no, a different tuning of the powertrain or even adding things like active aero won’t justify a whole new model tier. Every C8 model variant has a different powertrain setup from each other, in additional to significant chassis differences. 

So if there will be a “Zora” model that sits at the top, I can imagine a stripped out light weight “GT-spec/track-only” Z1RX with a revamped powertrain, or even more likely, a Rimac-competing EV hyper car that doesn’t compete directly with the Z1RX on the track, but puts a sub-8 seconds at the 1/4 mile.</div>

So no, they are not going to make more mid range models. There’s no room for those anyway, the mid range is filled out (and always has been, there has been a very narrowly segmented range of corvettes/prices/performances you can buy since at least the C6, not to mention the insane amount of engines you could get on the c3 for example) </div>

No buying clothes, gadgets or gizmos, random Amazon buy, eating out, etc. (Super nice that we did it during Prime Day! Didn't buy a bunch of random junk we don't really need.)

My first job out of highschool was $9.60 an hour and I was in college so I used to base all my spending on how much I made hourly. Is this $60 outfit worth more than 6 hours of work? Should I spend $20 on lunch which took me 2 hours to work for? I made around $600 a month and I couldn't even fathom surviving on that again but I made it work. That's about how much I pay now monthly for my car plus insurance but I like to pretend I'm back at that salary when I'm trying not to spend too much in a month and I end up making way better financial decisions.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">joe will do what he always does when he’s in a sticky situation… he’ll just ignore and pretend it never happened

a few years ago joe was “mr anti cancel culture”, anytime someone notable went down for it he’d talk about it for ages, there was a moment when every other episode he would talk about the louis ck situation but as soon as someone within his circle of friends got accused he clammed up 

he never uttered bryan callen’s name for close to years when he was accused of rape and i don’t think he’s ever spoken about chris d’elia since his accusations either

joe talks a big game but he’s a bit coward when it matters and he loves his money (don’t blame him) so he’d never risk jeopardising it so we won’t hear him speak about epstein again at least not in a way that would criticise trump; no way</div>

They’re no different than tiktok influencers and true crime podcasters getting paid by Hollywood pr firms and law firms to push narratives on things like Blake lively vs. Justin baldoni, Johnny depp vs. Amber heard, Karen read trial, Taylor swift vs. Kim Kardashian, etc. it’s always about the spin and controlling the narrative. Trump comes from this entertainment/reality tv world (he’s close to both tmz and National enquirer), so it’s not surprising he’s weaponizing influencers to spread propaganda and shift public opinion. These people all get their marching order from the White House. It became obvious when they received their epstein binders.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The Best Claude Code Setup For Real Developers (No frills, no vibery)

Context:
After evaluating various AI‑assisted coding workflows, this “no‑frills” setup strips away hype and nonessential plugins. It focuses on the core tools and practices that experienced engineers rely on to build and maintain production‑grade software with Claude Code.

Core Components:

Claude Code “Max” ($200/month) Plan
Unlocks the full Opus‑4 model, highest rate limits, longest context windows, and unlimited CLI/agent tooling.

Claudia (Community‑Built GUI)
A desktop/web interface (Tauri‑based) that layers on top of Claude Code’s CLI. Provides project/session browsing, visual diffs, token‑usage analytics, and custom agents.

Context7 MCP Server
Injects up‑to‑date, version‑specific docs and code snippets directly into your AI prompts. Ensures imports and API references always match your codebase’s exact versions.

Built‑In web_fetch / web_search Tools
Use Claude Code’s native HTTP fetcher to pull live data, scrape docs, or call internal APIs—without wiring in separate request libraries or headless‑browser tooling.

Good Specs &amp; Prompt Engineering
Invest in clear PRDs, wireframes/mock‑ups, and structured documentation first. Feed those artifacts directly into Claude prompts; the AI excels when guided by precise, human‑crafted requirements.

Why This Matters:
• Minimizes tooling bloat—no dozens of plugins or “vibey” no‑code widgets.
• Keeps your workflow lean and scriptable (all via CLI + Claudia GUI).
• Maximizes ROI: spend time on product spec and code, not wrestling with UI gimmicks.

Usage Tip:
Start every new project with a /init that scaffolds your README.md and prd.claude.md, then iteratively build features one function/file at a time, verifying via Claudia’s diff view.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I hear what you're saying but focus makes a substantial difference, focusing the mind. Especially if it is particularly mind oriented work, if it really matters what your mind is doing in each moment to the point where the energy of the body is focused on keeping it up and keeping it going that's a different kind of ballgame. 

I think for some people the non-dual realizations would be abundantly helpful, so if they focus their mind on something they can focus in a way that's not nearly as driven by ideas of what could go wrong or what they could do wrong, but instead they focus their emotional resources, more or less deliberately in a variety of ways. 

This way of being can be more natural for some, this way they can focus, they set an intention and immerse themselves. Of course that'll mean different things for different people.

Control is an illusion, something could happen at any moment, but when people are conscious of their thoughts and feelings it starts to entrain emotions and when emotions are entrained it can feel in a big variety of ways, there is a sense of stillness with motion involved, but it can also feel like you have some emotions working with others, like a connection, people can know this connection very well and understand how things can feel, generally speaking, like it helps them just know what's going on and what they could or could not do.

So, people can use the word control for reasons, they're embodying emotions all the time, constant expressions of life force come up in the body. 

You know, if all of your energy is up in your back or something and you get all tense down there, naturally a strong release for that would simply be some rising energy to the head with an expansive mindset because it'll really help get that kink out of there. That could feel like sucking an emotion up from the crown or it could feel like a push and a suck, some mix.

Like the awareness is perched up there and when it's recognized it can give a little flex in all sorts of ways, including letting go of intention with an expansive mindset.

One way I would personally consider going is having 24/7 devotion, it can feel about as simple as recognizing the color grey and something involving devotion can be involved in the experience somewhere in all those compartmentalized thoughts and feelings, like packets of information. Sometimes what's in the "packet" is prominent and other times it can come up surprisingly. 

I would word it like action and motion are fluid, there are tons expressions of life force in the body and there can be many emotional processes running in tandem and they can be complimentary based on the potential of the body at that given time. Emotions can be thought of like subdivisions and there are many bodily rhythms and bodily cycles, the body can only do so much so quickly. The subconscious can be on a dynamic track, as someone is familiar with the moment it can make future moments much more possible or predictable, even. So it's possible to have the subconscious on this track and vividly feed that motion with complimentary action at a dynamic rhythm, it can largely be like a set rhythm cuz of what the body can actually do, if the environment is alright it can end up that way.

What happens when it's done very clearly, noting energy blocks contribute, is someone can have emotions with the track whilst having other emotions and they can merge the track with these emotions they're making or they can have them in tandem and flow with the continuation of action rather than getting as mixed up in the motion.

What can happen when this is practiced is that people can have ways they enjoy having their thoughts, which can certainly still be quite meditative, but leaving some amount of room for creativity especially can make this fluid part really stand out. Nonetheless someone can learn to meditate better practicing this kind of thing because they begin to comprehend their emotional resource management. There are many different ways emotions can play out differently as someone is more clearly subdivided when desired and also where natural, because it's always happening. It's just like in music theory, and even in meditation their mind can be in different rhythms and their body can be in different rhythms, like they can just have their emotions and there could even be tons, but they'll know them in a way that helps them work in tandem. You could use the word "closer" in abstract terms, noting that the modern understanding of awareness is attention rapidly moves between things, and when emotions are flowing deep down in one's soul they know, there's always a knowing in conscious experience, connections in the mind on whatever subtle level, emotions are embodied and we do Not make emotions from scratch in their entirety, it's a big system of motion.

In this very way one can see how a yogi could be generalized like they're living more subconsciously, like playing an instrument or living by second nature. Energy moving around the body could feel like compartmentalized packets of many emotions, if energy is good and well then especially then they could feel it like they brim with potential, like they come out in a way someone knows they can work together.

So there are a lot of ways to benefit one's own self and coherence, like dynamic rhythm, attention at that rate can move really really fast. Even then, it's like a rhythm, even in nirvikalpa samadhi there is STILL an expression of life force through the body.</div>

They have to inspect the machine, perform routine maintenance, help load/unload it from the truck on site, walk around a dig site to get more context on what they're working on, etc. There's a lot of feedback that you also get by being in a machine that would be difficult to capture remotely as well.

There's also a lot of downtime for each machine, and a single equipment operator will often transfer to different machines at different points in time.</div>

I have zero experience coding. 

Fom (basically all day everyday) since the start of Febuary using sites like Replit and lovable at first, I've grown to easily creating entire apps in Visual studio.

It's literally trial and error and paying attention. Its copying code to maybe another chat agent to spot the problem for you.

It's looking up the meaning of things in the AIs explanation and understanding what's required.

Constantly I'm having random revelations a day about how to construct an app that in my earlier stage I would be though was impossible.

You learn what languages are used for and where they excel and what other languages they work with the best.

I couldn't code something in my own, but I don't need to. All I do is apply my knowledge pf whats required to be completed and know how to best communicate my requests to the AI in the way they'll most optimally complete the task correctly.

Oh, the utter value of sufficient error handling.</div>

But first you need a demonstrator, which takes 10 years. But first you need a prototype to prove the physics, which seems to be 5-10 years away. So IF, the current to proposed designs work, were 25 years away from first power and 35 from any meaningful amount of power. 


No, they all talk about fusion and fission to distract from the fact that they aren't planning for 10 years away, they're all just jacking up your LNG bills.


Solar and wind are the only modes that can come online quickly. Natural gas can fill in intermittency. That's our best-case scenario for the next 25-50 years... Sadly good power sources are woke so we can't have them </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Imagine when this happens per frame at 60fps, with coherency, consistency and logic.  Someone should feed this (if possible) simple rules, like consistent data, not trained off of images, but off of actually topographical data, with hardcoded rules.

The bowl should be human crafted, but the soup, 100% AI so to speak.  Im a game developer, but I would have no idea what tool is best suited for this.  Training off of images, for something like this is to me, a sub optimal approach.

but if we could craft the bowl ourselves, for some consistency, then how the AI would pour the soup would be a vast improvement.

If we could only capture the AIs output into volumetric boxes, or onto UV / 3D faces  live during runtime.  That would be a game changer.  Textures with built in real time prompts and constraints.

That would change the game much more.

Trying to do the entire thing in one go, leaves too much room for the AI to interpret incorrectly.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">To have any kind of real consistency, it needs to be able to store spatial data, keep track of where the camera is and where it's looking, and load that data back at will. In which case you've just reinvented  a game engine with much less efficient but more creative procedural generation and and AI rendering everything (which for most cases will be less efficient than conventional rendering). Stopping storage space getting out of hand will be a major software engineering issue, even Minecraft files can get quite big already (and that's a game where the level of detail is capped at 1 m cubes).

Right now the AI is largely predicting from the previous frame(s) which is why it goes so weird so quickly. Having it create further consistency by recording, rereading and analysing its previous output is something that anyone whose done video editing or image processing will tell you isn't going to result in 60 fps any time soon.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think AI is potentially a great tool for game development, but what you’re describing sounds incredibly inefficient compared to having a largely human-developed and prebaked game and graphics that strategically uses highly specialized, tiny, efficient AI to enhance things that are incredibly tedious to program, such as unique animations or animation combinations, nondescript procedurally-generated building interiors, or having random NPC dialogue dictated by chatbots that don’t break character, with real human performances or prewritten lines sprinkled throughout where appropriate.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It will happen over time. I think there will probably be a company that specializes in creating that bowl much like Valve and Epic are known for their game engines. 

This is like witnessing pong. You just know in 30 years this will be a whole other thing.</div>
