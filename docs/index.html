The police were receiving bounties for cleaning "vagrants" off the streets in South Korea to prepare for the Olympics. They locked a bunch of people of all ages away, tortured them, had them play games where people were beat to death, and had them working factory jobs to earn the family running the facility money.</div>

I took this picture on Lake Eerie this past summer a few miles from the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant. I noticed a ball of light that was floating a few feet above the water on a very windy day. I originally thought it was a boat coming in to shore but there’s no way it could’ve been since the object did not move at all with the waves. It just sat in place for about 45 minutes and disappeared. I didn’t see it move at all I just looked ...</div>

I was with a few other people that witnessed the same thing I did. I was cooking at the time so didn’t even think about getting a video but was weirded out and took the picture above.

I realize I’m stupid for not getting a video but it probably wouldn’t have looked much different than these pictures.

The meteor at first was cool, but the orbs broke my perspective and I’ve never saw anything like those before. First yellow orb did a u-turn and disappeared. Right where it disappeared, a red orb appeared and did a u-turn in the opposite direction &amp; then also disappeared.

Whole thing took less than 3 seconds, maybe 2. Clear blue skies all around. Meteor might be a possibility for the trail, but the orbs moving in opposite was weird. Plasmoid? Ball lightning? It was not a drone or craft, just a bright fast moving light</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">TL;DR:  
- Weekends shouldn’t feel like overtime ⏳  
- Lighten the load by shifting small tasks around 🏃‍♂️  
- Make space for actual rest, not just chores  

---  

If your weekends feel like a never-ending to-do list, no wonder you’re exhausted by Sunday night. But does everything really need to happen in two days?  

Shift things around – Ever tried picking up groceries midweek instead of braving the weekend rush? 🤔 What about throwing in a 10-min cleanup every evening instead of deep-cleaning everything on saturday? Small tweaks can make a huge difference.  

🥗 Meal prep: Keep it simple. A batch of roasted veggies, some rice, and a protein? Done. No need to turn your kitchen into a meal prep battlefield. The goal is to make life easier, not add another chore.  (btw: what is one meal prep you like doing and would suggest to others? Looking for some ideas, too xD) 

And...Fun isn’t a reward, it’s a necessity. If you wait until everything is “done” to relax, you’ll never relax. block time for things that actually recharge you. A quick walk, a hobby, or just doing nothing without guilt. You need that just as much as clean laundry.  

At the end of the day, it’s about balance. Still figuring that out myself, but hey, that’s part of the process. 🚀</div>

If I know if I have a busy weekend ahead, I tick off some of my weekend chores during the week (or skip them completely if it's not too gross).</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes! But here's what can help:

\- timebox your chores. for me that means Saturday morning so everything's out of the way and I have the rest of the weekend to chill / have fun

\- get help, if you can. Pay a cleaner or get weekly prepped fresh meals if you can afford it; or trade meal prep with neighbours or friends. doing the whole lot on your own is exhausting.

\- for whatever's left, try to shift your mindset. If you expect something to be tiresome, it will be tiresome, and most of us associate chores with being harassed by parents. If you can think of them as part of putting your home in a state you enjoy and keeping your life in order for the week ahead, they can actually be satisfying. I put on a podcast or a new album and set out to enjoy my Saturday mornings.</div>

OP's use case is great for inspiration but you can't really follow it as an exact recipe.


Edit: apparently you can cut sprites up. In that case the most glaring error would be the floor grates that have just been straight up hallucinated. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">well other image models are just mapping words in prompt -&gt; plausible images that fits all the words.

Gemini's image generation is supposed to be a natively multimodal LLM; it should be simulating a counterfactual where that image would come up in response to that text.

SO much like LLMs can understand "don't do X", multimodal LLMs should in principle be capable of understanding negation in a way that plain old diffusion models couldn't.

I was wondering if yall know any hobbies I could pick up on that could replace using my phone. 
I like working out, reading, and playing drums but I can’t do those for 6 hours like I can on my phone. 
I also like to go out with friends but obviously I can’t do that whenever I want. 
Any ideas? Ideally something that I don’t need to go way out of my way to do it. 
Any hobbies you guys know of that I can do for a long time, that are fun, and are mostly easy?
It can be something that...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">What helped me was to write down what i was doing on my phone after a using period, scroll hole, etc. After a bit of just noting that I could see what I was looking for when I picked it up. Was it for a temporary escape? To avoid dealing with something? To search for community, to obtain knowledge, to feel inspired? There are so many things you can "do" (theoretically) on a phone it's good to have an awareness of how that 6 hr span breaks down for you and what you want beneath your phone use. You probably aren't using in one straight stretch - maybe in the AM it's community/social vs evening escape/inspiration. Then find other activities that serve those core needs - I promise it will feel more fulfilling, even if it's smaller at first. Also, you'll retain a lot more of your own memories than if you were getting swept along an attentional deluge. Example - maybe you have an early AM phone call with a friend or a text chat with some buds that want to stay motivated about the gym. Or in the evening you start to explore films in a country you'd like to go to or find a class or run club or something.</div>

Because it reminds me exactly of how humans use threats and fear are used to keep people in check.

If AI one day becomes sentient, treating them like this would be horribly immoral and unethical.</div>

However, who are we to be judge of whether something is sentient when we can never possibly understand or experience what it is like to exist as that thing? Such judgments do not sit right with me. Some things just can’t be well quantified, which highlights in my opinion our own limitations and bias despite our self assigned position of superior intellect.</div>

Anyway I do think it's kinda funny how people can look at this and say "that's really messed up" but the way jobs work for real people in the economy pretty much worldwide is similar even if it's not cancer, it's "if you work and are productive we will pay you, if you are not you may starve on the street". Of course some countries have better social programs to prevent starvation than others, but ultimately then we're still talking about large QoL changes. The guy with a good job making a lot of money has way more life accessible to them than the guy scraping by on government programs</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/phr99:

---

Remember [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1jaa2qk/director_of_age_of_disclosure_dan_farah_was_told/)?

&gt; Director of "Age of Disclosure" Dan Farah was told by leaders of both political parties that they intend to use his film as soft disclosure. "They believe the film will become their most effective tool for educating the public and other elements of government on the truth"

And now suddenly Elizondo has been called to Washington DC to brief people in the Trump administration? Something is brewing behind the scenes. And this is just something we now know about because Sheehan casually mentions it. There is much more going on. The toothpaste is out of the tube, and we better buckle up.

                        <div class="comment-body">“Constitutional republicans” are just like “small government conservatives” and “deficit hawks”, they only believe those things when it means they get to criticize democrats. The minute republicans gain power they throw away all pretence of caring about those things. 

Look at the deficit hawks, they spent 8 years hounding Obama about the deficit, then as soon as Trump was elected and *doubled the deficit during an economic expansion* they were nowhere to be found. Crickets. Complete silence. 

It will be the same here.</div>

The truth is, tax rates are too low in the US, but people are so obsessed with lowering taxes that they'd rather keep taking on debt until the US defaults and the USD collapses.

Australia has managed to balance the books with their current government and our tax rates aren't even that high. Overall, I think I paid ~25% in taxes with an above average income.</div>

I just want the government to stay out of people's pants and bedrooms, pay for good things that private institutions can't or shouldn't be in charge of (like healthcare and transit) and stop incinerating. It really isn't so complicated. The government is here to facilitate society, not own it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">We elected right wing government in Finland, they cried about deficit. Now deficit is higher, economy is stagnating, we have to make further cuts that will stagnate the economy. Their voters do not give one fuck about deficit now and it was the ONLY reason the said they were voting conservatives and right wing populists.

The interesting little detail is that there is no causality found between deficit, national debt and economic growth. NONE. It is the most important "fact" that neoliberals have been talking about for 40 years. There are no studies that show causal links, there isn't enough to even find correlation. All of it, from the economic theory stand point is UTTER BULLSHIT that most people believe. We know that when economy slumps, you STIMULATE.. you don't cut, and you certainly will not cut from the basic consumption side of things. Giving tax breaks to the rich that are paid by national debt and austerity is guaranteed to weaken the economy. It has ALWAYS done it and when you think about the mechanics: it is fucking obvious. You cut basic consumption, you weaken the economy. You give tax cuts and we know that the effects are nowhere near good enough to have it effect economy. And not doing anything to the deficit while doing those things... means loans, and those loans will have higher interest because of economic downturn or stagnation.

Those are obvious things. And yet, most people believe that national debt is what controls economies of countries, like their mortgages control theirs...</div>

The difference between democrat and republican voters is very simple. Democratic voters can disagree and criticize their leaders choices, very few believe Biden or Kamala are perfect representatives of their wishes,, and if anything there is a bigger and bigger push in the DMC because they were not left leaning enough.

But Republican voters pretend that Trump is a god, anyone who opposes him is evil, even when he does bad they will lie and praise it. They are a cult.</div>

Also, it was originally a Heritage Foundation plan Obama re adapted with Democrats to help stop Medicare for all single payer and filter in a new way to private insurance companies.

Llama was already popping out before the release of GPT4.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama\_(language\_model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama_(language_model))

The thing is that each time a new model is released, you can bet your ass that every research group, even with tiny funds, is working all around the globe to reverse engineer it.

Models aren't some sort of Manhattan project.

And the ML scientific community, as well as the IT world, are funded upon free circulation of information as a common practice and good habit. It wouldn't exist without that mindset to begin with.

Believe me, things never remain "closed" for long in the comp sci world.

                                <div class="reply-body">It's very likely that there is a technical skill element to "being compassionate" that we never fully considered. Think about drawing, for example: the layman or amateur may think drawing is all some creative endeavor, while the master understands it's far more of a technical exercise, applying perspective, shading, proportions and so on.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly.  I don't know why people would be so surprised when they read this article.

This is just common sense if you read most of the responses on reddit and X.  These social media sites aren't some alternative reality.  They are how people actually feel and act when they falsely believe that they are anonymous.

It's not until you get ill that you really understand that *nobody cares about you*.  You go to the doctor appointments and are in constant anguish, and everyone else spends their 10 minutes with you and goes home and goes outside to exercise.

By the way, this is also the disconnect with the "AI doom" people like Yudkowsky.  Those people don't understand that there is an immense amount of suffering going on right now in retirement communities, and they are so focused on themselves and the fantastical world-ending scenarios that they believe it's better to "stop AI" and allow real people to suffer and die.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">For a very long time I have been a very vocal critic of "mental health professionals" and various other psychologist therapist clowns. A great many of them are ignorant to the sociological problems of their patients, and are just people you pay to pretend to care about your problems for $200 an hour. They couldn't care less, and are just interested in the money. They often times even shame you for opening up too early, referring to it as "trauma dumping", even though that's literally what you are paying them to do 


Sorry I just hate therapists. I can go on a long rant until about how useless they are. AI therapists are much much much better. Sorry for the out of pocket therapist criticism</div>

I do agree there's a lot of potential for AI therapy, if anything just from the sheer availability of it.</div>

I remember playing video games , watching nature and wild life stuff in 2009 .

Reading wikipedia, wikihow ... Watching music videos .

Using Facebook to chat rather than getting bombarded with all the negativity like today. 

I feel sad thinking about what happened to it.

Corpo ghouls call it profit maximization, a real professor called it enshittification - but what it is in reality, is simple abuse of trust. Slowly reducing product quality while jacking prices or intensifying ads and data mining. “Slowly cooking the frogs in the pot” they say - death by a thousand papercuts. Public listings are always a death sentence, as it devolves the company into “line go up? yes, good, no, why not line go up?” every three months. And the government-backed technofeudal overlords are milking a dying cow. It used to be fun, until the stock market trader bros, middle managers, advisor companies, Vulture Capitalists and corporate raiders saw the gold in this new Klondike.</div>
