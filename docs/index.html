Their goal is to literally fill Facebook with fake users that will feel real and also keep you on. Many people don't like people that are too needy, constant messages every time you open your app would actually cause those people to leave the app.

I think the main goal here is for the AI to identify the sweet spot for different people.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, i also don't get how that should be related to training.  
The main issue here to solve is that LLMs are stateless. They have no 'awareness' about time.  
And to implement that you could timestamp every reply. The question is just if the LLM will pick up on it. But maybe that can be done with a clever system prompt. But to make the chat more immersive it could then reply: "Last week you asked XYZ." Or lets say you told the LLM that tomorrow you have a job interview, and the day after the LLM would be aware of the passed time and ask: "How was the job interview?"   
I'm actually playing around with that right now and am working on context injection, like making the LLM aware of time and the current weather.   
But yeah training has nothing to do with that.</div>

Maybe American troops on the ground in Iran in two weeks? We're honestly at the point where nobody knows.

                        <div class="comment-body">There is an easy fucking solution to Joe's concerns:  
1: Read the fucking room and know your audience...the fact he's meant to be a comedian, talking to another comedian...tells you how switched on he is  
  

2: FFS this isn't rocket science...Japan is a ultra capitalist hell hole...its great to go and visit as a westener...but to be Japanese and fall outside the Bourgeoisie is absolutely fucking hell...if anyone has ever bothered to speak to the locals when we do our larping over there...they'd know this.  
  


They're not having fucking kids, because of the ultra capitalist structure puts all the fucking barriers in the world to stop that from happening. 

They also provide a decent level of education...so their citizens know what is happening</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">We need the same kind of power revolution to coincide with the AI one to keep up. In the long run, if we're talking about scaling AI with the technology we have today in generation (e.g. battery tech, solar, gas turbines, etc.) we'd essentially be blanketing the entire planet with power plants.

Fortunately, the technology around power generation is continuing to develop. Maybe not at the same rate, but solar panel price to efficiency continues to improve, and so has battery tech (think solid state and energy storage) over the past 10-15 years.

Either way, I think it'll still take a lot. My hope is that as AI systems continue to innovate and improve, they are also maintaining a drawdown on power requirements. That seems to be happening as well, where at some point, those things catch up to one another and can also be done using only clean power sources</div>

I've been vomiting for 15+ years.
I've done every single gastric exam and allergy test there is, and lately got diagnosed with anxiety and the meds actually helped, but it never stopped. 

After prompting it my exams it suggested me to check an otorhinolaryngologist for dizziness.

After a brain scan, It turns out I've been living with a massive labyrinthitis caused by a nerve pinch in my brain. Fully treatable.

I'm starting my treatment this week, hoping for the best.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Wow, I had a really similar experience. After a seizure-like episode sent me to the ER, the first neurologist I saw told me that I was making it all up for attention. Thankfully, the second neurologist actually took me seriously. He did a spinal tap- which no one had thought to do before- and ruled out meningitis.  Turns out I had occipital neuralgia, caused by a pinched nerve in my brain. 

The symptoms were brutal: sudden electric shock-like pain from the back of my head to my forehead and behind my eyes, light sensitivity, numbness and tingling. Baclofen helped for a few years, and it mostly went away, though I still get flare ups if I spend too long hunched over. Mine was likely triggered by a combo of whiplash and terrible posture from marathon study sessions in college.

So glad you got your answer and a treatable diagnosis - rooting for your recovery!</div>

Even now that I am confirmed to have endometriosis, it’s still a struggle to get any sort of healthcare and I still pretty much have none. ChatGPT has been a godsend in understanding my options, advocating for myself, understanding symptoms and all the intricacies of this disease. It’s a shame that we have to rely on AI for that sort of support, but I’m very glad it’s an option now. Wishing you lots of luck in your surgery!!</div>

It is an unfortunate fact of the human species that very few people are willing to part with large amounts of their wealth, no matter how staggeringly large that wealth is. Yeah there are exceptions, e.g., Bill Gates has already given away tens of billions, I expect at least him and a few others follow through on The Giving Pledge... but it's very rare.

We don't need to eliminate billionaires, but if our goal is to raise the quality of life of everyone, which I think should be the ultimate goal of any human endeavor and especially a government, then billionaires need to be _required_ to fund a large portion of what should be robust, universal social services and welfare programs. The very worst-off person must have a decent, comfortable quality of life and financial security... then they can make all the money and go play on their superyachts all they want.</div>

If Grok 4 actually got 45% on Humanity’s Last Exam, which is a whopping 24% more than the previous best model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, then that is extremely impressive.

I hope this turns out to be true because it will seriously light a fire under the asses of all the other AI companies which means more releases for us. Wonder if GPT-5 will blow this out of the water, though…</div>

I'm not sure how this whole endeavor will go, I have my doubts, and believe there are better options for the food crisis (using funds to heavily subsides health food options like fruits vegetables dairy and eggs). But something needs to be done about the soaring cost of food and tbh im glad to see its actually being addressed.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hey everyone! I’ve been meditating for some time, but I only managed to enter a truly psychedelic or non-ordinary state once before. Recently, I tried again, and I wanted to share what happened with you all.

I meditated for about two hours.

At first, it felt like my mind was restless, with many thoughts floating through my awareness. But I simply observed them without judgment.

Gradually, my breathing became deeper and more intense, and my body started relaxing completely. The feeling that I ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yoooo that sea beach sky metaphor is snappin! I’m reading a book right now that put something into perspective that your comparison reminded me of about being influenced by the sky. 

So you have your objective world and then your subjective world in your mind. Where you go when you envision and manifest. The place i feel i neutralize when i meditate to allow for better guidance, less ego. That subjective world (your mind) is giving you imagined experiences (like imagining your at that beach) and from that information you come back and have thought that leads you more toward that reality. 

This gave me a new perspective on the importance of meditation and on the other side of that, not envisioning bad stuff from lust to suffering of others. Because then that’s what my thoughts and feelings may be leading me to. Great post friend</div>

Edit: this is commentary about people neglecting to do maintenance then trying to paint a car as unreliable, not poor people not being able to afford bills.</div>

Those that did and were in ok/decent shape got a spray coating and two slaps, that's not going anywhere. No further warranty. 

GM is doing this now with their 6.2 V8s. Totally fucked? New engine. Not fucked yet? Here's some different oil and a sticker on the filter.

                        <div class="comment-body">It's not an "OS," that's just marketing fluff for VC money.

It's just a repackage of existing open-source browser automation tools with LLMs.

They just take an existing Linux distro and let you install "apps" (which are just shortcuts to the browser version of that "app" - like Spotify web, Outlook web, etc. Not real apps, just PWAs).

Then, they use one of many open-source "browser automation with AI" frameworks.

Spend some effort marketing on a mountain with all the free time you get from using existing open-source stuff, and VC money starts rolling in.</div>
