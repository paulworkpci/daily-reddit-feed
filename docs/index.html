And they're not just stealing Claude compute use and reselling that, there is a legitimate value layer added on top that ManusAI is trying to capture on.

If anything stuff like this should be encouraged, we've only really just begun exploring even current stage LLMs and there is a lot more value that can be gained from using LLMs in a lot of different areas that haven't been explored.</div>

On the Joe Rogan Show, Lue sketched on a pen and pad of a black “wedge-shaped” craft. When I saw that I immediately went to Dr. Jonathan Reed’s encounter book of the black craft. It had bothered me the sketch and this image were so eerily similar.

Now Dr. Jonathan Reed is an interesting topic because his documented experience wit...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes. In every single post here about a personal encounter with Elizondo, he comes across as extremely ingratiating and manipulative. Always encouraging the person's prior beliefs, complimenting them, but never committing to specifics or admitting to ignorance. Extremely telling when a ufo pundit is seemingly incapable of giving a honest "i don't know" answer to a question. </div>

One thing I’d add is to also recognize that some days, despite all the planning and preparation, things may not go as expected. That’s okay too. Not every work session is going to be perfect, and being kind to yourself during those times can prevent burnout.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">That’s not embarrassing at all. Breaking overwhelming tasks into smaller steps is a smart and effective strategy, and you’ve found a really creative way to do it.

What matters isn’t whether the task seems “trivial” or how much support you’ve needed before.... it’s that you recognized things are harder right now and found a constructive way to keep moving forward.

I hope things start feeling more manageable soon. And don’t forget to take care of yourself too.</div>

Once you are out of the agency and specially once you lose your security clearance, you are outski. Even with a clearance it is hard to argue you have anywhere close to the same level of access or tryst while working for some contractor vs for the agency itself. Yeah you can talk to a few people on the inside but they don't tell you shit you aren't supposed to know so you might as well be a civilian from their POV, and they themselves have their own need to know.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I have a very niche answer. We don’t know what is supposed to naturally bind to the area that benzodiazepines work at. 

Benzodiazepines, BZD, are medications like Xanax and Valium. They produce anti-anxiety effects. And they have a very distinct chemical shape to fit into the BZD site in a group of five proteins. But we don’t know what is supposed to go there. Many medications are analogs of naturally binding molecules that we copy and then use to create an effect. The BZD site is for something, we just don’t know what.

Edit: all you wonderful people. I am headed to bed. I will answer anything else in the morning. And feel free to reach out if you ever have a question. Witnessing so many genuinely inquisitive and intelligent people has made my day. Please never stop learning. Thank you all.</div>

Also Grok's calculation is way off. $194.7B ÷ 330M people ÷ 11 years = $53.64 per person per year.

Not saying we shouldn't support Ukraine, but it's kind of disingenuous to calculate an average cost and include years where Ukraine wasn't at war in that average.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The premise at the start is also totally wrong

The US doesnt have a flat tax, rich people pay the majority of tax revenues, then corporations. Must funding isnt even covered its all debt. 

To actually figure out how much the average person pays you need to correct for the percent of the budget that is income tax, then account for the progressive tax system, then account for the interest payment on debt, you should also consider the difference between just selling the military equipment and sending it to Ukraine. Its actually very complicated to figure out how much this war costs the average person</div>

The general concensus seems to be that our leader are still mystified about what these objects are.

The Babylon Project was a dream, given form. 

Its goal: to prevent another war, by creating a place where humans and aliens can work out their differences peacefully. 

It's a port of call - home away from home - for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs, and wanderers. 

Humans and aliens, wrapped in two million, five hundred thousand tons of spinning metal... all alone in the night. 

It can be a dangerous place, but it's our last best hope for peace. 

This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations. The year is 2258. 

The name of the place is Babylon 5.</div>

but my brain does the same, I think you have to see it in real live to update the real life filter.  
After all the last 25 years all robots were CGI in movies.

                <div class="post-content">A month ago, I did a post where I was looking for help. I'm pregnant (and tired as hell) and still working ('cause life ain't cheap). I was struggling to stay productive while caring and looked for advice, but all I found was people telling me to rest because it's going to be hard after.

It was so frustrating! I didn't need to feel guilty; society makes you feel that way anyway.

I'm sure there are other women in this situation, so I hope this helps :

                        <div class="comment-body">This is excellent advice - I have my own business and work from home. I make lists of “high concentration/complexity” tasks and “routine/mundane” tasks and if I have a low energy day, I focus most on the tasks that are less demanding. Having the lists is helpful for me because I can experience “overwhelm” which can make it harder for me to prioritize. Some days I just don’t have the fortitude to problem solve hard things (this doesn’t always mean I have the luxury to skip those tasks, but if I can, and I feel burned out, I will). Every day is different for me. ❤️</div>

Your strategies, like defining weekly priorities and using time blocking, have already made a big difference in my day-to-day work. 

Thank you so much for your advice and for sharing your experience! It's so encouraging to see that it's possible to be productive even when life throws curveballs at us.</div>

Not saying anyone couldn’t just break the treaty, but it wouldn’t end well for them. Russian &amp; China have already been known for violating rules of the treaty. 

I do think there will be some sort of war there in the relative future. I do think there are large oil reserves there that have been untapped. The Antarctic is the “newest” biome on the planet, it was once flourishing with flora and fauna. Comparison to present day Tasmania.

You can fly from southern Chile to Antarctica in 2 hours from late November through to early March. Charter flights to the Antarctic Peninsula and South Pole are increasingly popular. If you're looking to avoid the Drake Passage, a flight from Punta Arenas or Puerto Natales is likely to be the best way.

Or take a cruise. It's really worth it, I've been twice. https://www.swoop-antarctica.com/cruises</div>

The quality of answers and lack of deep discussions no longer exist on Reddit, nearly every subreddit has gone political, too many echo chambers, too many bots, pseudo intelligent people, one dimensional thinking or just people with bad attitudes.

I only use a.i. as a last resort. People who do not understand how computing works, chatgpt seems is like magic to them. It just steals content, sometimes reshuffles it and spits it out. It gets better with training, that's it but it does not and is not capable of coming up with original stuff, it always needs data to train on.</div>

People can be pretty hostile, and it also seems like everyone is *so* intelligent, *so* successful, and makes a shit ton of money in their 20s and 30s (like top 5 or even top 1% incomes—all the while saying their $250k+ a year incomes are not enough to live off of—). I feel like this is pervasive on countless subs, not simply the financial ones. It can be rough trying to compare yourself to people who are just doing amazing out there. People also continually say that XYZ is not that much money (as in $100k is a poverty income for a single person, $1 mil in investments isn’t much money, etc). So it’s like if they can’t swing it, how can the rest of us? It has given me a kick in the ass to want to better myself, but I can’t help but feel like crap in comparison to other Redditors.</div>

You don't know anything about the other person on their life yet the brain loves to compare your life  with theirs. You see them suceeding where you arent and that feels bad. But you have no idea if they are an father with a wife and three kids who lives in a HCOL area, a trust fund baby who just plays with their parent's money, or a retiree with a lifetime of savings to play with. Or they could just be an asshole who loves flaunting their accomplishments and making people feel bad in comparison. It takes effort to train the brain to stop comparing itself to others in this way.</div>
