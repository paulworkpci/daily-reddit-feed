**Full Hearing** [**https://live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv347256589**](https://live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv347256589)

Correction: not currently but it was yesterday

&gt;***2nd General Assembly of the Federation of Parliamentarians to clarify unidentified anomalous phenomena from the perspective of security***

&gt;***In the United States, the name of UFO has changed to UAP (unidentified anomalous phenomenon). In addition, a specialized organization has been established in the Department of Defense, and NASA has a research team, which is being tackled seriously as a security issue. Based on the current situation, we ask the government to take the same initiative as the United States. ( Excerpt from the press release)***

The following submission statement was provided by /u/CreditCardOnly:

---

Lue Elizondo, Christopher Mellon, and some unnamed colleagues met with Representatives Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), Tim Burchett (R-TN), and Eric Burlison (R-MO) this week to discuss UAP &amp; drone incursions.

[From Lue on X](https://x.com/lueelizondo/status/1905656773748380043?s=46&amp;t=M0ofkkf9lgSjlI29wi9d5w):

“Chris Mellon, myself and our colleagues were in Washington D.C. this week and had the opportunity to meet with several Senators/Representatives and/or their staffs to discuss the current UAP and drone issues facing our nation. 

I am extremely encouraged and humbled to see the level of effort and investment by these officials. Please keep in mind, that in our eagerness to obtain transparency we need to allow them the necessary time to work on these incredibly complex issues. 

This is a great step forward but we need to have patience as they begin to peel back the decades of denial and misinformation. I am very encouraged by the direction they are taking and so should you.  Thank you specifically to Rep Luna, Burchett, and Burlison!”

But turning that into a clear update, feedback note, or bug report? That’s where all the time goes.

It often feels like half of my work isn’t about solving problems — it’s about rephrasing what I already figured out so it makes sense in Jira, Slack, or an email thread.

Feels like there’s an invisible time sink we all just silently accept.

Anyone else notice this? What’s your solution?

                                <div class="reply-body">Totally agree with this mindset — reducing friction on those small but constant context shifts really adds up. We’ve also leaned into tools that help with writing clearer, more structured messages depending on who it’s for — like a quick template that turns a messy thought into something shareable (Slack, Jira, whatever). Anything that lets you spend less time formatting and more time actually thinking is a win.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I often find it faster to write a short message clearly if I first put the whole thing into complete sentences in my head, before touching a keyboard or pen.

On the one hand mental redrafts are much faster than written ones, and on the other hand it usually makes me understand my own idea better, although I thought I understood it already.

If I start writing too soon then I spend much more time tinkering with the wording. Then sometimes I spend so long that clarity starts going backwards, like when you repeat a word too many times and it loses all meaning, but applied to the overall message.

That's not to say edits aren't be needed after writing if I prepare the message mentally first, but they're usually fewer and easier.</div>

But mostly the same people were invested in both as those who backed Elon when he bought Twitter already got 25% stake in xAI.

All stocks buyback in this situation is just that everyone who owns shares in X will get a specific number of stocks in xAI based on their relative valuation.

An example company A is buying company B. The all stock deal can be that for every 3 shares in company B you get 1 share in company A. Shareholders of company B in this way become shareholders of company A.</div>

Nothing says “safety” like operating a forklift (or driving to and from work) with a schedule like this, and youre putting both jobs, your safety, and the safety of others at risk. Depending on your construction job, you’re also increasing your risk of injury.

Look, i worked 70-105 hours a week for a long time (dont tell DOT), and Ill tell you, im lucky i didnt fuck myself up worse than i did. I was 27 when i tore my rotator cuff and hurt my neck. I have a ligament tear in my knee, and in my pinkie. And I may or may not have totaled a brand new Mercedes because in my exhaustion i confused unclipping my seatbelt with putting my vehicle in park.

I’d also do it all again if it were to see my kids, but seriously, *explore all of your other options first*</div>

This is a test I give to various models and 4o has done the best of any model so far - both 4.5 and the new Gemini 2.5 get the Japanese Friendship Garden wrong, but 4o nailed it.

Has anyone come up with a benchmark for this yet?</div>

Even more so since this model does almost everything they do, from inpainting, text coherence, editing, style transfer, cohesion... All while being at least 10x better. 

This release must have REALLY stung, just look at what the Midjourney CEO said about it the other day lmao.</div>

Well, for those that can run them any way. The good news is that this means advances in LLMs will also apply to image generation.

Mostly, yeah, but one thing I have noticed is that 4o does a bad job with "painterly" styles - the brushstrokes look really off and unpleasant imo. It's better at just about everything else, but purely from the perspective of making something aesthetically pleasing and artsy, midjourney is still what I'd use at the moment.</div>

Gardening, cooking, woodworking, weightlifting, soccer, beer brewing, guitar, the list goes on. This spring I built a maple syrup evaporator and reverse osmosis system.

I cycle through hobbies, sometimes seasonally or even yearly. I didn’t touch my guitars for almost 10 years when my kids were little. Recently started playing again and having great fun.  Will I ever advance beyond intermediate ? No but I I already knew that.

My day job is for specialization and optimization and monetizing. My hobbies have none of that pressure.</div>

The cycling through hobbies is a way to generate dopamine because the newness of hobbies is exciting. Then the dopamine high wears off and on to the next hobby.

It doesn't matter which hobbies or what the money is for, it exists specifically so I can decide to pick up woodworking for a while with the full understanding that I'll never be terribly good and probably be bored of it in 3 months.</div>

I'm not sure what the case is for everyone, but this is definitely very common in LA. But also I think a lot of content creators are fairly wealthy, and that is why some people watch them. As odd as it sounds.</div>

There is no crime against humanity being committed because they feel their personal goals are becoming less valuable. Humanity is much bigger than any single discipline. The pursuit of art is valuable, STEM pursuits are valuable, playing sports, exploration, etc. - they are all human endeavors in their own way.

I've heard it myself, the stuff they can do is crazy. However as a visual artist I know that there's a big difference between technical skill (which i guess is the "better" part), and something that is made with passion. And don't get me wrong; an AI could make a brand new Nirvana song in no time, it will sound like Nirvana, have the same imperfections as Nirvana and maybe even feel like Nirvana; but it can only do that because Kurt and the gang have given it a template.

For the last part, I can say without a doubt you're better than I am as much as an AI is better at chess than you, but yeah. I still love playing music, even if i am shitty! lol Same as with art. I'm pretty good at art, but I'm inspired by other artists that I feel are just amazing.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree with the title, I disagree with the notion that it means artists are trying to be arbiters of what makes a human. Just because art isn't inherently more human than other human creative endeavors, that does not mean it's no longer a creative human endeavor that many people enjoy and desire.

A lot of people *do* act like arbiters of what makes a creative endeavor "human", but a lot of the artists you're referencing(not all fucking artists) are actually pretty subpar, and create art in the form of artistic expression just to justify their grand stand.

It's annoying to see people over generalize and say that all artists are like this just because a loud portion are.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Most people who make art do it because they like to make art. Garry Kasparov was defeated by AI almost 30 years ago. Since then, interest in chess has grown significantly. People were concerned that we would lose interest, that everyone would think playing chess had become meaningless. But it turns out that just because AI can easily beat people at their own game, it doesn't mean that people will lose interest in playing the game. People like doing things with other people, competing against other people, showing off their talents, and enjoying other people's talents. Even if other people, or machines, can do it better.

People won't stop listening to human music just because AI can compose and produce music. They'll still support their favorite artists. People won't stop buying excellent art from great artists, and it may even increase the value of art for many just to know that it's not AI.  People won't stop learning, growing, and striving for excellence at any of our traditional pursuits and we'll continue to invent new ones.

Personally, I believe that AI will eventually be able to do most knowledge work and advanced robotics and automation will do most labor. Most people will either work in oversight of autonomous systems, or they'll have to find some other work that we can all agree we'd rather have a person perform. If technology is going to "take all our jobs" that means that there will necessarily be some kind of shift in how the world works.

It could be that the majority of us will get left behind and suffer some kind of dystopian transformation of society, or it might be that we begin to value wealth and status less, reject the notion that all people must find some way to contribute to our economies to enjoy the benefits of society, and instead put our focus on finding other meaningful ways to thrive.

Whatever happens, we're still going to be people. Whether we're banded together in tribes, dancing around fires in some devolved echo of civilization, or living in some high-tech utopia where we spend the majority of our time pursuing leisure, creativity, culture, and connection. Or anything in between. We're still going to do the things that we have always done.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; that does not mean it's no longer a creative human endeavor that many people enjoy and desire.

nobody is saying this tho? everyone can draw, paint, sketch to their heart's content, that's the beauty with art. How goes the saying of a famous painter? all you need for art is being able to close your eyes. And AI being a thing shouldn’t stop you. 

For example I will always implement sorting algorithms my own even if they are thousand libraries + AI who provide them in 2 seconds but I love sorting algorithms. 

Or when programming synthesizers I will always start with a plain sinus sound even tho I probably have already a patch somewhere with the finished sound I’m after or could even just sample whatever I need out of Suno or some dedicated sample gen AI model. 

Why don’t I do it? Because it’s fun.</div>

They honed their skills for years and are now competing with AI art. This affects their ability to acquire money for their skill.


Their livelihood is being decimated and you're making a post with a sentiment that says "boo hoo".


Also your framing of religion as associated with a dark age is unfounded. Science emerged from religious contexts, which encompassed so much of the drive for knowledge and morality of human beings. We still pursue these things now.</div>

I agree.

People who were already struggling to make a living, being told to "get over themselves". 

Ridiculous.

However --

I will say, if those same artists who are vehemently against AI created art, are somehow totally okay with LLMs replacing programmers or doctors, they are being hypocritical.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yep, early scientists were usually quite religious and the christian view of the world is what enabled the scientific method to be born (basically by saying the world is God's creation and as such, studying the world is understanding God better. Instead of purely following texts or holy men like in other religions).

People use Galileo as an example that the catholic church was intolerant and close minded but when you look at the story, Galileo mostly got in trouble because he was a bit of an asshole and had a lot of personal beef with important people in Rome. Not solely for his views.

I'm not saying the catholic church has always been perfect or a beacon of tolerance but it gets a lot of undeserved bad press when it comes to science.</div>

As well AP was not actually banned from the press room only from the oval office. It's already a short invite list for the oval office so it's not exactly something the AP is entitled to.  Anytime they do something out of that office it's special invite only.

Edit.. ha ha voted down for the objective truth.  Too bad this sub is mostly fake accounts, bots and brain-washed they thems.</div>
