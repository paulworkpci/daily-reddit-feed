**Edit:** /u/MrKalyoncu posted [the tweet](https://old.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1lv8qi8/grok_becomes_the_first_ai_to_have_an_official/n246oqt/) (image [here](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2F7qcgb3p4wrbf1.png%3Fwidth%3D1179%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D9ac44184f15a83eeaca3cd3692734d421ef359f7)). It includes threats, which does change things some. Still, coming from a well known "edgy" LLM, IMO it should have been ignored.

                                <div class="reply-body">Turkey:

* Frequently Arrests journalists using “disinformation” &amp; “terror” laws.
* Heavy use of Article 301 (illegal to insult the state/Atatürk).
* 97% of media pro-government; dissent censored online.
* Site bans (with threats to jail staff):
 - Twitter for not censoring corruption reporting
 - Facebook for not censoring protestors
 - Youtube for insulting Atatürk
 - Instagram/WhatsApp during protests
 - Wikipedia for 'terror propaganda'

Lets not celebrate them banning another website because it made fun of their dear leader just because you dislike Musk.

This is from literally yesterday:

I've been working as a VFX Artist for some years now. This year, the job market as everybody knows is scarcer than usual on stylized cartoony projects which is my specialty.

Given all this free time, I wanted to start learning more about what goes into making a game from scratch. For me, this translates into starting a game and learning on the way. So, gamedevs, which AI was the most useful for you? Both in coding and explanations. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;Multiple victims (e.g., Virginia Giuffre, Sarah Ransome, and others) have testified that Epstein directed them to have sex with his wealthy associates.

&gt;Virginia Giuffre (one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers) has alleged that she was trafficked to numerous powerful figures, including Prince Andrew, former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, billionaire Glenn Dubin, and others. Some of these claims were detailed in her 2015 defamation lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell.

&gt;Court depositions from Epstein’s 2006-2008 case (which ended in a controversial plea deal) included testimonies from victims describing how Epstein and Maxwell groomed and supplied girls to his friends.

&gt;The 2019 unsealing of documents from Virginia Giuffre’s lawsuit against Maxwell included allegations that Epstein kept a "list" of powerful men who participated in his sex trafficking ring.

No fucking way. Epstein and Maxwell knew what they were doing was illegal and they both went to prison because of it. There is a list of clients obviously. If only for ammunition to blackmail. 

There’s some back room shenanigans going on that will come to light years down the road. This president has/had an ultra close relationship with the two. It’s not unreasonable to think he participated. 

In earlier times that alone would have sunk him, yet here we are.</div>

It really bugs me when people take shitty people and then overinflate what they’ve done, it hurts everyone.

Maxwell was convicted of trafficking 4 people. She most likely trafficked more, but there’s no evidence.</div>

                <div class="post-content">A few months ago, I tried using one of those AI app builders to launch a mobile app idea. 

It generated a nice-looking login screen… and then completely fell apart when I needed real stuff like auth, payments, and a working backend.

That’s what led us to build Tile, a platform that actually helps you go from idea to App Store, not just stop at the prototype.

You design your app visually (like Figma) and Tile has AI agents that handle the heavy lifting, setting up Supabase, Stripe, Auth flows,...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I've been down the same rabbit hole with AI builders that demo well but completely shit the bed when you need actual production features. The "pretty prototype → deployment hell" gap is real.

  
What you're describing with domain-specific agents is actually the right approach imo. Instead of one generic AI trying to handle everything, you need specialized agents that understand the nuances of auth flows, payment processing, etc. Each domain has its own gotchas and edge cases that a general-purpose model will miss.

  
The full code control + zero lock-in part is clutch too. I've seen too many teams get burned by platforms that work great until you need to customize something or migrate away.

  
Been building similar stuff at my current gig - we're working on Raindrop, which lets Claude deploy full production systems through natural language. Different focus (not mobile-specific) but same core insight: you need AI that can actually execute end-to-end workflows, not just generate code snippets.

  
Quick question - how do you handle version control and collaboration when multiple people are working on the same app? That's always been a tricky part with visual builders.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Looks neat, built off of a long line of memory-related research from the authors. However yeah the advertised numbers come from comparing MemOS to GPT-4o-mini with Memory. The actual gains compared to previous proper memory systems are neat but far smaller. Reading a lot of papers after a while I kind of stop taking testing on specific benchmarks or toy problems at face value too, so where their research goes next and how far their MemCube method will scale we'll only know with time.

And if you're interested[ here's another research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02259) paper also on long-term memory AI</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I first thought this was about https://mem0.ai/ and was already stretching my fingers to write a Grok4-inspired rant about how shit it is (or was?).

We’ve of course already evaluated all “memory” strategies under the sun (except this new one, obviously), and I’m pretty high on https://github.com/getzep/zep-python. Well, not exactly Zep, but the engine behind Zep,  https://github.com/getzep/graphiti.

It literally feels like magic, because it makes LLMs aware of “time” and the changes your entities may experience as time passes.

mem0 is... well, let’s put it diplomatically: it’s what happens when you let researchers ship an actual product. Blargh. Nothing really works, and if you think you can fix it by coding it toward your use case, you’ll get brain bleeds from the architectural design errors, the kind not even our interns would make.

Also they stopped their benchmarks at some arbitrary point so you don't see on their homepage that graphiti/zep is running circles around them.

A MemOS review will follow shortly, but “researchers release product” is already kind of the excitement killer.

Please dear researchers. Do research. Don't do products. Thanks.

&gt;However yeah the advertised numbers come from comparing MemOS to GPT-4o-mini with Memory.

which is perfectly valid, because gpt-4o-mini is also the backend for MemOS in the benchmark</div>

Trump likes to get mileage out of anything he feels makes him look good, and theoretically this is one instance where he was a legitimate victim. Weird how he's quick to play the victim when CCN is mean to him, or reporters ask questions, but not when he got shot? Wounded pride and ego don't explain it. Something is off there. It's like someone who takes credit for the work of others not taking credit for something they did themselves for once. Instinctively I feel like there is something here.

I'm truly baffled how he's barely mentioned it, we know nothing of the shooter or his motives, and nobody is even asking. We know even less about that golf course shooter.</div>

I picked up an episode not too long ago about archeology but that's like the only one. I dialed his show waaaaay back now, kinda sad but also refreshing. It was really grating on me with the same tropes for literally years after COVID. I definitely miss his show pre 2020...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">They also report the average amount financed coming in at a record $42,000. I have to wonder if it’s just that new car shoppers today are more affluent and lower income shoppers are being priced out of new vehicles. $1000/mo looks a lot different to a household pulling in $10k after taxes.

Edit: Working backwards on the math in the article, the most average purchase price is $45k-$50k depending on taxes, for what it’s worth.

2nd Edit: The [average household income for new car buyers](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2024/01/car-buyer-experience-improved-in-2023-study-shows/) in 2023 was $115,000. [Average age of new car buyer](https://hedgescompany.com/blog/2019/01/new-car-buyer-demographics-2019/) was 53 years old (kids off to college, mortgage winding down, more expendable income). So yeah, this number is shocking when the average Redditor [is barely out of college](https://adamconnell.me/reddit-statistics/) (23).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; When the current consumer debt bubble bursts it will make 2008 look like an afternoon market correction.

It won’t. The reason 2008 was so bad was not because of over leveraged consumers or home buyers. It was over-leveraged banks. Consumer debt is absolutely a drag on the economy, and a consumer debt bubble bursting (whatever that means in this context) would almost certainly result in a recession, the depths we can fall are less than that of 2008 because the banks are not as vulnerable. Affirm, klarna, and a bunch of little personal loan companies can all go out of business without tanking the economy. And their insurers are almost certainly in a position to cover losses without risking insolvency.</div>

I’ve heard that meditation can help with loneliness by making you feel more connected to yourself and less overwhelmed by negative thoughts. I'm wondering if anyone here has experienced that.

Did meditation make any real difference for you? Did it help ease the heaviness or help you feel more at pe...</div>

If by meditation you mean the Western approach mostly used for stress reduction and symptom management, then it might offer some temporary relief but probably not deep healing for loneliness.

But if you're referring to the Eastern tradition of meditation, centered on seeing through illusion (of self) and realizing truth, it can profoundly shift your experience. It can reveal that the self you believe is lonely is itself an illusion, and in that realization, loneliness can dissolve into a deeper understanding of your true nature.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The best answer in this thread. In the end, it depends on how you perceive the human experience.

 Will you view it through a Western lens, where only the material world exists? 

Or will you perceive human reality through an Eastern lens, where everything is a cosmic illusion maya and you're here to realize who you truly are?

  
All depends on you.</div>

At least in my experience the human mind craves some degree of human connection, and if it does not get it then you start to suffer. Not in the dukkha sense, but more like being hungry of getting physically hurt.

But I'm sure it would let you weather feelings of loneliness more skillfully. And I could be wrong.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Meditation does not substitute for human contact and attention. I think it could help with chronic loneliness if you use some of the time during the meditation session to visualize and invest energy into the life you desire, including being surrounded by friends if that is your wish. Remember, you get what you concentrate on. There is no other main rule.

It is worth noting, however, that friendships and relationships can require a great deal of tolerance, acceptance and patience with other persons who may be quite unlike yourself.</div>

At a quick glance, I feel like SurfSense has way more customizability than NotebookLlama:

1. They only support OpenAI, while SurfSense supports pretty much any LLM API.
2. They only have ELEVENLABS TTS, whereas SurfSense can work with six different providers.
3. Their search is basic semantic, while we use a hybrid approach over a two-tiered RAG. TL;DR: our retriever is just stronger.
4. They're locking you into LLAMACLOUD… not cool. We already have Unstructured support, with Docling on the way.

And one last thing: we already have a pretty big community on Discord. We'd love to have you join as a contributor</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I actually really don't like this attitude.  There's been a lot of research into persuasion over the past couple of decades, and while some early studies showing a small backfire effect got a ton of media attention, those studies haven't really replicated- most large studies show that when presented strong evidence against a deeply held belief, most people will become slightly less confident in that belief, and that this change in confidence is cumulative over time.

For many people, especially those who choose their beliefs to conform to some identity, correcting a false belief can take years or even decades of frequent exposure to evidence and counter-argument- but it does happen.  You can see that in polling trends- Boomers are less racist on average than they were several decades ago; belief in the Satanic Panic gradually collapsed as the evidence was repeated over and over; the fanatic support for Bush's wars that you saw on the right in the early 2000s has faded almost to nothing; irrational fear of gay people fallen dramatically. Evidence and persuasion played a role in all of these shifts.

This belief that there's no point in trying to persuade the right has been a popular one since before Trump, and I think it's done a lot of harm. The alternatives to evidence and persuasion- shaming and deplatforming- don't seem to have worked at all, and may actually have contributed to Trump's rise. Unlike shaming, there's no instant gratification in persuasion- nobody ever does a 180 on a strong belief after a single counter-argument, no matter how true. But that slow work of chipping away at peoples' confidence in falsehood is something I think we need to get back to if we want to have a real hope of fixing the culture.

So, to the OP: thanks. I think this sort of post does a lot of good.</div>
