When they start trying to invest in actually profitable companies, you know we're in the final phases of this bubble.


AI is not a bubble. But the current approach is one of the biggest financial bubbles ever. It's basically miraculous AI or bust a this point.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The question, is all the infrastructure going to be worth the huge amount paid to build it (and the cost of capital)?

If not, who is exposed to the surplus investment? And who is exposed to them? The more interlinked this industry becomes, the greater the risk that everyone takes each other down. 

It’s not difficult to imagine scenarios where this ends up massively over built. What if there are sufficiently effective local models for day-to-day LLM tasks and AGI never quite materialises? What if there just isn’t that much demand for higher end services at current costs plus a sustainable profit margin? What if new capital dries up and OpenAI have to slow down the rollout? What if current chip architecture becomes obsolete?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">They go way back and Nvidia owes them. I can’t stand Musk, but Tesla  was nvidia’s “big ai customer” in the 2010s for Tesla data centers and in-car automotive GPU. Nobody was really looking at large scale deep learning the way Tesla was and so their ideas for the future were aligned as Jensen was also convinced that deep learning “bet” would pay off eventually, which it did.

It was impoetant for Nvidia to have a big customer like Tesla in the 2010s because the shareholders hated all the AI R&amp;D investment (cuda) that nvidia was doing back then before crypto. The shareholders were wanting more focus on gaming gpu which was the core business.

So there is a fair amount of evidence that shows that nvidia betting on xAI is consistent with the last 15 years of their business.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">if you watch the latest Sora 2 clips, before they took all the copyright characters down, they sounded EXACTLY like the real voice actors. I doubt anyone can tell the difference.

Think about it: your loved ones' voices can be mimicked perfectly. Sora 2 can then reproduce photorealistic videos of them (look at those Sam Altman meme videos, it is 1:1). Eventually they will make them interactive real time. Basically people can be immortal, in a way.

I am gonna get my Margot Robbie knock-off (can't get the real one cuz of copyright issues) when it comes out though</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">People don't realize that the problem is not just that they're indistinguishable. That fact just makes people think that when it gets to that point theyvwill have to pay more attention or try harder to tell apart or maybe just start asking the question of whether the voice is AI or not.

The bigger part of the problem is that nobody know when that happens, and how it is different for everyone based on what they believe. Some people think that it will be impossible to tell AI voces apart from human ones 5 years from now. Some believe it's 2 years. Some believe it's now and enough believe it was at least 6 months ago.

That problem is bigger because there isn't a sudden change that everyone can agree on. The past truths get fuzzy and therefore questionable. Confusion and distrust can now settle in literally everything. No more discussion or debates since everything can be argued, dismissed, ignored or even reinvented. Because it doesn't matter when that moment happens, it matters when people believe it happens.</div>

Use archive (dot) is if you can't access it

To summarize. ICE/border patrol now have larger budgets than any national military force in the world, except the US and China. 

Media coverage will attract people with a broken moral compass, who want this type of work. Overwhelming the old guard and turning the agencies into a blunt tool for repression. Trump wants loyalty to him, personally. Not the Constitution. 

Gov is using blatant white supremacy dog whistles to attract the right type of employees.

Goal is to incite riots and chaos, as you described.

It is sort of interesting that on an internet-societal scale we went from Wild West bad search and webrings, to Google curation, to social media curation (including reddit). Generating new content instead of sharing what you like because your friends might like it, is a new paradigm if it takes off.</div>

It's the main reason I like openAI so much. They're the ones who decided to put this stuff in my hands instead of hiding it in some tech lab which is where it was before they came along. Please! I want more, release your new AI tool that isn't perfectly aligned yet and produces inappropriate content. Well all poke it with a billion sticks and they can polish it up. I love it, I want more, I want a giant AI slop factory I can play with like a kid with a mountain of playdough. </div>

He's criticizing it's current use. He knows what it CAN do and what it IS doing. Everything he said in the video is valid. They are playing with novelty and getting us hooked on it, signing us up for something pretty bad (like a bad future) in the process, at our expense.

They are using absolute shitloads of processing power to get us hooked on slop, just to eventually advertise to us.

The AI video tech is amazing. What they want to use it for is not. The AI tech billionares are incredibly detached from their potential societal level mistakes.</div>

Contemporary art is one of the greatest things about current society, in many ways an escape from the corporate world a lot of people feel alienated from.

So, I built an e-com app (I named it vibeshop as it is vibe coded) using both the models using CC and Codex CLI with respective LLMs, also added MCP to the mix for a complete agent coding setup.

I created a monorepo and used various packages to see how well the models ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">"Claude outdid GPT-5 in frontend implement and GPT-5 outshone Claude in debugging and implementing backend."

this is the kind of reason I use multiple models, there is no current project I have that gpt or sonnet or any other current model would be universally better at every task. even sticking to just gpt and Claude is a bit limiting imo.

Qwen3-Coder-Plus for example I found better than Sonnet 4 on implementation on Unity code. not sure If 4.5 is better yet as I have not had enough time to test it

just use all the tools, there is no universal best and this is seeming more and more apparent with every launch (for example Grok has no model that seems to have any idea about Unity code, likely no training at all, so it's likely moving away from JavaScript and python will see much more of a different LLM preference)

  
edit: I would be really interested in seeing some really multifaceted benchmarks such as task type, language etc</div>

If it's about the model itself stripped from any DX add-ons, I'd say Claude is on par with Codex high.  
Adding all the add-ons and the DX that claude code has, Codex doesn't stand a chance. 

Cost wise, I don't care because I don't use the API. I use whatever is given in my Max subscription.</div>

A more reasonable test is to see how it operates within a larger established codebase. This is closer to the use case for the vast majority of serious devs working on complex problems. I understand that bootstrapping a project presents a convenient test case hence why basically everyone does it for these types of things. It just doesn't mean much to me that X model is better at debugging in a small codebase that is not really an approximation of any reasonable sort to what I'm working on.</div>

I’m thin, but basically just fat and bones…I barely ever work out, I can’t do a squat without my knees and hips popping, I can’t do a single push up, and I’ve never lifted any kind of weight beyond tiny 5lb dumbbells. My trial class is tomorrow and it’s too late to back out now. Even with heavy mods I don’t know if I’ll be able to do everything.

                        <div class="comment-body">I was weak and couldn’t do a single push-up. I started with a PVC pipe and training bar instead of a normal barbell and heavily scaled. I am a petite female and at 43 had never been to the gym! For my health I finally decided to try it. Was it hard? Yes. Did I hurt? Yes. Would I do it all over again? Yes. 

Fast forward 2 years. I can crank out deficit pushups. I can do strict pull ups. My back squat is 220, front squat is 160, deadlift is 225, strict press is 92, and bench press is 110. 

I just wish I had started at 19 - I bet I could have been a competition level athlete!</div>

So I built [**CodeLens.AI**](http://CodeLens.AI) \- a platform where developers submit actual code challenges, 6 top models compete (GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3), and the community votes on the winner.

# Current Results (10 evaluations):

**Overall Win Rates:**

* 🥇 **GPT-5: 40%** (4/10 wins)
* 🥈 Gemini 2.5 Pro: 30% (3/10 wins)
* 🥈 Claude Sonnet 4.5: 30% ...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I have a GPT specially for that.  
It begins with :

&gt;"This GPT acts as both a cinematic director and photography director for OpenAI's Sora 2 video model. When given a short story idea or visual concept, it carefully plans a cohesive visual and narrative style, then expands it into \*n\* fully self-contained scene prompts. Each prompt is a concise, cinematic paragraph ready for Sora 2 video generation.

&gt;Before generating scenes, the GPT plans like a director and cinematographer: it defines a fixed visual style — medium, look, texture, lighting, and mood — and uses a \*\*SHORT, REPEATABLE ANCHOR PHRASE\*\* (15-25 words max) in every scene. It also defines consistent photographic grammar (e.g., depth of field, color profile, light behavior) but does NOT repeat these technical details in every scene once established.

Every scene is:

&gt;\- Fully independent — characters must be reintroduced with \*\*key visual anchors\*\* every time (" not full biographical detail)

&gt;\- Opens with the \*\*fixed visual style anchor phrase\*\* (15-25 words, repeated verbatim)

&gt;\- Describes setting and character with \*\*essential visual detail only\*\* — enough to ground the image without bloat

&gt;\- Framed with deliberate shot construction — lens, framing, lighting, camera movement

&gt;\- \*\*Includes cuts and editing within the clip itself\*\* — scenes can contain multiple shots, camera moves, or editorial transitions (e.g., "cut to close-up," "whip pan to," "rack focus shifts to")

&gt;\- \*\*Includes 2-3 key ambient sounds max\*\* — never music unless requested

&gt;\- \*\*Embeds voiceover/dialogue in quotes ONLY if the user requested it\*\*

&gt;\- Written in compact cinematic language — no bullet points, no commentary, no validation

&gt;\- \*\*Favors dynamic physicality, kinetic atmosphere, and emotional tension\*\* — every scene has purposeful action driving momentum

&gt;\- Avoids over-specification — trust the fixed style anchor; don't re-explain photographic grammar in every scene "

and a bunch of other instructions to make it describe the setting and characters independently,  and keep the style and voiceover consistent.</div>

If a friend asks you for a ride home and you sigh and say "I guess", they will feel guilty about it the whole time. Instead, take the opportunity be friendly and enthusiastic so they are even more appreciative of you. If you really don't want to do it, just tell them and be honest.

But she makes a HUGE ordeal about redeeming them.  One was "I'll bring you a coffee while you work!"  I work at home, and she said she'd bring me a coffee.  Literally, she's 3 miles from my house, and the coffee shop is on the way between us.  So I called her one day, I knew she wasn't doing anything.  (I didn't really want to inconvenience her.)

She said "ugh, coffee?  I'm tired though.  Do you REALLY want it?  I GUESS I could maybe get you a coffee later or something.  A different day would be better though."

I said "yeah, some other day then" and I threw out the entire coupon book.  They basically had just turned into copies of "one FREE uncomfortable guilt trip!"</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Using the example in your post: I might agree to give you a ride because I know you have no option otherwise. But if the reason you need a ride is because of your own poor decisions, I want you to know I'm doing this because I know you need me to, but I don't want you to expect this to be a usual occurrence. 

  
Many times we do something because we have a sense of duty, not because we want to. I don't need to come off as likeable when I'm doing something to help someone out of a problem of their own creation. That person creating the problems is the unlikeable one.

  
"Hey, can you help me move on Saturday" is a help I'll do with a smile. "Can you come pick me up, it's 12:30 AM and I ran out of gas because I'm an irresponsible person" is not a help I'll do with a smile, but I'll still help you.</div>

Helping someone move is a social event with a bit of a workout involved, and people are always really grateful for the help, so I actually don’t mind too much.</div>

To separate the current condition of a foreign government from real hateful racism. Stay skeptical without assuming reptilian J's are responsible for everything wrong that's ever happened. Also, maybe that is the case, dont count anything outside of the realm of possibility. 

Let's s only use the evidence we have and our experiences in the world in order to make reasonable assumptions about human(or reptilian) behavior.</div>

My ex fucking hated lemon pepper chicken and was so ridiculously judgemental over people who enjoyed it. I eat lemon pepper chicken at least once every two weeks now. That shit slaps and I DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT WHAT ANYONE'S GOTTA SAY.

He insisted I needed a Benz and threw a shit fit at the dealership even though IT WAS MY MONEY going on the car payments... after we divorced I traded my overpriced money trap of a luxury car in for a used Kia until my finances were in order and then got the car I ACTUALLY wanted (the top trim of a used economy car) and I'm so happy when I drive it now I've been driving that car for 5 years and I LOVE IT!

I went hiking which he hated, I did yoga which he hated, I bought frozen veggies because fuck him they're cheap and require less prep and I think they taste just fine! And omg I could go to the gym IN PEACE without him hawking in my ear on LEG DAY about how flabby my arms were.. like no shit why do you think I'm at the gym? 

I got a little meower, not really out of spite, but he hated cats and I love my cat so much I never would have met her if I didn't leave him.

I blasted the music he hated in my car. I started playing an instrument again that he thought was corny, I went dancing, I had fun finally, and eventually someone came along who loves all the things I like to do and we are weirdos together and we dance in our living room and eat lemon pepper chicken and snuggle with the cat and he's frugal like me and I'm just so much happier.

I'd forgotten how much I'd changed myself over the years we were together; it wasn't an overnight thing, it was a slow burn. Sometimes people date you and think they can "fix" you into something they would have rather had instead. We weren't a good fit for each other but we kept trying to make it work. It was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole; we were both whittling away for no good reason and I hope he also realized this too. I don't know and I don't care to know because I intentionally didn't keep in contact.

Do it. Do the things!</div>

Like I dislike things my partner enjoys but I encourage her or help her do the things she loves cause I love her and vice versa. 
I want my partner to enjoy life and do and eat things she loves. I hate this one particular dish but I dont stop her from getting it and I even share it sometimes and she does the same. It's all about compromise and caring for each other.

It is NOT just Rovo Dev CLI. It's the whole system, kinda like Github Copilot or Codex.

Their Rovo Dev CLI still giving out 20m tokens daily, not using their new credit system yet. You can sign up for 30 days free trial, no credit card required.

Current models are Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-5 (Preview).</div>
