First I restart at an earlier prompt.  I typically request that when debugging, do not rely on your initial assumptions.  Instead, review the code carefully, develop an understanding of the functional intent and current outcome.   Establish at least 5 potential causes - review the code against your 5 predictions and narrow down to the most likely cause before continuing.  


If I can't be bothered to review the code myself, I will sometimes start a new session with Claude in the role of a code reviewer tasked with simply reviewing the code for alignment with best practices / look for potential errors etc.   I have a giant prompt for this I won't. Paste here, but a code reviewer is a great way to highlight potentially problematic pieces.   

I specifically ask it not to propose fixes during the review.</div>

The issue is almost always in the logic between various functions. You need to be very specific when it’s outputting code and have to actually understand on some level what it’s outputting to see if it followed instructions. 

Lots of people miss that the way they communicate involves a lot of inferences to context the LLM doesn’t know but is obvious to you.</div>

It is utterly frightening that this is hailed as an advancement for humanity. Mankind has proven that it will exploit any resources to gain benefits. It does not take much super-villain thought to realise the manipulative power of such technology.

And really, I don't think that older gens yet realize how much they are going to lose when AI takes their mid-career jobs.  The older you are and the more they pay you, the more the company can save by replacing you.  Plus, who needs middle managers in this scenario?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I actually think this a huge problem.. like, yes AI will definitely challenge the need for many the low and probably even average skilled in many professions, but there might still be something interesting about the most brilliant humans in every field. But they don’t usually come out brilliant straight of the box (when they graduate). They still need time to do their 10,000 hours and develop their skills.. we are about to lose that pipeline.

So right now we might say AI isn’t replacing our best writers, artists, programmers etc. but we are going to have a problem in a few decades when we don’t have new talent being brought up.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">As someone else said, this assumes the AI will also never replace the experts.

It also assumes how junior people are currently trained is the optimum way to make someone an expert. I don’t this is true either. In most professions I’m aware of junior people are “trained” by just doing all the mundane shit no one else wants to do, because there’s no one else to do it. 

We could definitely create more effective ways of transferring only expert knowledge, within the context that AI will do the rest.</div>

I doubt that these people are nearly as brain dead as they say they are and I also highly doubt that any anesthesia is used.  EDIT: I also just found out that organ harvesting tables have straps to prevent involuntary muscle movements from interfering with the surgery or in the rare case when the brain dead patient is able to leap from the table. When they suck out your bone marrow you are probably screeching and throwing your arms around like Terri schiavo rather than laying still like a slaughtered cow</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">My late 27 year old cousin was in Thailand a few years ago and went to the hospital because of back pain. The night after he's found dead splatted on the street. They said he must have jumped from the window on the 13th floor, but I know him and I'm certain he would never have done that. Always suspected organ harvesting. It's the only logical reason, but my dumb family refuses to see it. They are more consoled by the fact that he jumped because of some pain medication delirium.</div>

Which, honestly, is shockingly sad behaviour. Bro, you’re a multi-billionaire. Have the tiny amount of balls required to hold your own frame instead of trying to impress randos and accidentally appear even more sociopathic than you already do. 

It’s like Zuck trying to appear cool for Rogan. It’s such sad behaviour. You’d think at a certain level you’re able to confidently do your own thing instead of trying to look cool in front of the school jock.</div>

I know this is seriously impressive technology, but a lot of these are still deep in the uncanny valley - so much so that I find a lot of the "Well that's the end of filmmaking!" hype to be extremely overblown. Not saying it won't improve, but we're not nearly at that point yet.</div>

It's like watching your life go by at 1.25x speed as you turn 20 and then 1.5x by the time you're 30. I assumed I was going to be basically at 2x by 40. Trump has completely flipped it. The past 4 months have felt like years. 

He's also accelerated the endgame of capitalism so I'm looking forward to watching his voters blame Hunter Biden or Hillary's emails as their share of the pie gets smaller, that's always fun.</div>

I would add that you learn a lot by making mistakes. I know someone who only does things when they're a slam dunk sure thing. That means he mostly does nothing and learns nothing.

Getting your ass kicked by life isn't fun when it's happening, but you come out stronger and often have a fun story to tell.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I am not sure if I am getting this the way you meant. 

I am petrified of public speaking and am also a bit of an introvert. Most of my colleagues were even more petrified so I ended up giving a lot of technical presentations, and eventually working trade shows and giving speeches.

I was not comfortable at all the whole time, but became good at acting open and affable. People would even comment how natural and approachable I was. It was never natural, and required overcoming some major insecurities.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Sounds like you faced a big fear and have achieved some success at something you were initially petrified to do. Even better that others recognize your skills. 

The happiness OP is talking about isn’t necessarily about liking the specific uncomfortable thing; the happiness comes from the pride of facing a fear, the effort you put into the challenge, and from the knowledge you can do hard, scary things. These moments build confidence and resilience, and lead to more satisfaction in life.

Rather then wasting time on the 10 and fatiguing I do 5,5,15,5. After the squats it seemed enough to get right back to it. Obviously gonna feel different with the vest but I only had a 2-3 min difference on 20 rounds with the vest. It’s the last run that kills ya. 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🔥🔥🔥🔥 let’s go!!

If you are going to do 20 rounds of Cindy you may want to consider 5-5-15-5, splitting the pushups into 2 sets of 5 around the squats for the same reason.</div>

So I've been in a huge rut for 8 years. I've had no friends and I've spent 100% of my days bed rotting. No hobbies, no job. I couldn't bring myself to "just do it": message that person on Bumble BFF, apply to that job, cook, start any hobby, etc. I've grown up with zealously overprotective parents who did everything for me (chores, choosing my high school classes, choosing my university program, etc) so I was basically handicapped. I lived every day miserable and ashamed, spinning ...</div>

All this to say that for a certain group of people (such as me) meditation may not work. I think I am completely numb. Anyone else have this experience?</div>

People will shit on Anthropic for being too safety oriented, but Anthropic and Deepmind are very noticeably focused on doing things that at least have the intention of benefiting humanity.

I think Anthropic's Interpretability research is some of the most interesting stuff you can find, and it's a shame that 90% of the people following AI are either crypto grifters, or depressed accelerationists who have nothing going in their lives, only caring about a race to the bottom between the corporations, with no care if people get mindfucked by ChatGPT's constant sycophancy glazing, or if models get used to create misinformation that changes election results.</div>

Dario constantly makes exaggerated claims, and I've started to wonder if most of them are things he doesn't even believe but knows will get people hyped up.

He's the one who's closest to LessWrong style doomerism, which is why wonderful philanthropists like Sam Bankman-Fried were funding a huge part of the company at the beginning.</div>

None of the hospitals in my local area allow flowers to be brought into the wards.

Some allow pot plants, but others state you cannot bring any plants in.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Maybe senior living centers, then, if full-on hospitals aren’t a local option? Standalone hospice facilities may be a better chance, too.

Some other potential options:
* Organizations that help with low-income housing
* Organizagions that help home-bound folks
* Halfway houses
* Domestic violence shelters
* After-school/summer services for kids of low-income families — they can be used to teach something like flower crafts or experiments (like for white flowers, experiments with food coloring) or even just making small bouquets for the kids to take to a parent or older sibling — kids _love_ being able to gift their favorite humans something, and many may have never had the chance to give flowers before

Basically, think of situations in which a person is likely to benefit from a little pick-me-up, and look for local organizations who work with those folks.

(I actually skipped cut flowers entirely at my wedding because I hated the idea of them only being used for a few hours, so it’s nicer to think about them having a longer purpose.)</div>

There was also the argument that by 2019 Subaru had already worked out the bugs with that generation from the manufacturing side, and at least in their case, the car has been trouble free since purchase.

I’d like to think the majority of kinks are worked out after a few years.  I’m no engineer but I would guess that in the last few years of a generation the incremental subtle improvements taper off? 

Perhaps not. Who knows. Maybe it’s less of “buy only the last model year” and more of “don’t buy the first model year” lol 

Case in point: 2021 model year RS6. Boy howdy has this car needed work done, spending about 2-3 months every single year at the dealership.  I’ve heard the recent model years are far better now.</div>
