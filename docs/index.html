Life is full of tasks we should do, or need to do, but are unappealing for whatever reason. 

The **best** way to overcome this is to have something waiting at the end that's worth waiting for. I'm incredibly food motivated and love to be outdoo...</div>

I figured out the secret (for me)—I tell my wife the task/metric/goal I have to hit and when I need to hit it by. Sometimes I’ll tell her what I’d like my reward to be (ie: check out that show I’ve been hearing about, take a nap on Saturday, etc) and sometimes she’ll choose a reward for me (some examples: long day, so she tells me to crash in the other room while she gets the kids ready for bed—I just come in and read to them after a 10-15 min break vs cleaning teeth, changing, etc)

She holds me accountable and it definitely gets me locked in/focused</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You guys are way behind on this lol. This is already sort of happening although not but humanoid robots.

There are already mine sites where big operations are running trucks that are either fully or partly autonomous. In the oil sands, those 400-ton Cat and Komatsu dump trucks are completely self-driving now at couple of mine sites.

Before, each truck needed two drivers on 12-hour shifts to cover a full day. Now with autonomy, there’s no downtime for shift changes, bathroom breaks, lunch, or operator mistakes. The trucks just keep moving around the clock, way more efficient.

Each driver used to cost about $200k to $250k a year. Companies save that salary and cut all the extras too. No more workplace insurance, pensions, benefits, camp housing and meals, flights, shuttles, or rental cars.

When one person can monitor ten trucks instead of driving one, the ripple effect is huge. Fewer drivers means less camp staff, fewer shuttle drivers, fewer HR people, fewer payroll staff. It all adds up.

At first, retrofitting a truck with autonomous systems cost about a million dollars. It was rough getting the technology working, but now it runs pretty smoothly and more sites are making the switch.

Support equipment like dozers, excavators, shovels, and graders will take longer. There are too many variables to automate those right now, while trucks just go from point A to point B and dump.

The future is in the trades, at least for now. Electricians and mechanics will always be needed to fix things when they break. Until robots can crawl under a dozer that just came out of muskeg and swap out a starter, humans are still required.

What I think will happen is machines will be designed in a modular way. Everything will be a box you unbolt and replace. That part will be shipped off to China for refurbishing instead of paying a tech $80 an hour to do it in the shop.</div>

Someone shut the fuck up for two minutes and let the other speak then rebuke on your own fucking time.

It's going to be somewhat polarised I feel - some people will basically abdicate any agency and use AI to outsource all their coding, and some other will be smart enough to still do the learning and doing bit and then magnify their impact by leveraging coding co-pilots and agents. 
OpenAI and Anthropic will make money either way (less sure about Cursor, Lovable and Replit).</div>

I gave up on using aider/claude code other CLI tools months ago, as I was burning through €70+ in credits just in one evening's coding.

Codex running with my ChatGPT Plus plan €20 per month (and not the OpenAI credits) is the big gamechanger for me.

(btw what \*are\* the limits?  I've been using it on medium and feels unlimited? Not sure how to check if I'm approaching a limit or not. Is there a way to check my limit?)

(and anyone have any MCP recommendations to use with it? Seems very capable as-is)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt; Lieutenant Tim Fecht hits a button and an insectile DJI drone rises silently from the station rooftop. It already has its coordinates: a local mall where a 911 call has alerted the cops to a male shoplifter. From high above the complex, Fecht zooms in on a man checking his phone, then examines a group of people waiting for a train. They’re all hundreds of yards away, but crystal clear on the room-dominating display inside the department’s crime center, a classroom-sized space with walls covered in monitors flashing real- time crime data—surveillance and license plate reader camera feeds, gunshot detection reports, digital maps showing the location of cop cars across the city. As more 911 calls come in, AI transcribes them on another screen. Fecht can access any of it with a few clicks.

Lol, meanwhile when I call the police about the active murder happening next door they might have an officer here in 45 minutes with a potbelly and a bad attitude</div>

Mostly I focus on breathing and relaxing but Id like to step it up and dedicate more time to focus on sex and pornography addiction. Has anyone had success in dealing with compulsive behaviors like that? Are there related guided meditations i should check out?

Meditation is as close as ive come to f...</div>

Try one time when the urge comes, feel it immerse in it observe it and see if it comes and goes. If you have succeeded once, this means you have the absolute ability to overcome this urge, and then is the matter of consistency.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I work with men on this particular issue. It’s not uncommon to have strong sexual urges and mediation can often intensify and bring even more awareness to these compulsive tendencies. 

Learning to circulate the sexual energy through your entire body, not just your genitals, can be very helpful. The Hollow Bamboo Meditation technique Will Johnson teaches is what I’d personally recommend. The strong breathing along with pelvic rocking can release deep samskaric patterns that are stored as tension in the body. Deep beneath most addictive behaviors is stored trauma and pain which we try to dissociate from. Sex provides only momentary release from this pain which then returns. 

Will’s recent book is highly recommended: [The Radical Path of Somatic Dharma: Radiant Body, Radiant Mind](https://a.co/d/hWdVVwz)

If you’d like to reach out and get more assistance, we could go more into how meditation could be combined with other techniques to help overcome compulsive behavior. I could also share a video course on the Hollow Bamboo Meditation Program I recorded.

What? You can get a Supra for $33k in Japan? That must be an error, right?</div>

Anyone in the market for something like that though is probably far more interested in a more fun car at the 40k+ price point though.

These things are going languish on lots at over 40k.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Former Claude Code user for a few months on Max 20x, fairly heavy user too. Loved it at the time, but feels like at least during part of last month the quality of the model responses degraded. I found myself having to regularly steer Claude into not making changes I didn't actually agree on (yes I use the plan mode, it's highly valuable). Claude also often told me that code was production ready when it wasn't, it either failed to compile or had some kind of flaw that needed addressing.

Found out about a $1 Teams plan offer for ChatGPT so figured it would be a great opportunity to check out Codex CLI and GPT\_5. Suffice to say it impressed me. I tell it what I want, it just does that. Most tasks I've thrown at it are usually completed and successful in one or two shots. If I'm possibly wrong or there's a reason to debate something first then it usually does so, while Claude would've often said "you're absolutely right, ..." - blindly agreeing with me regardless. GPT-5 also makes far less assumptions compared to Claude, regularly replying with open questions if it has any. After it completes a task GPT\_5 will usually follow up with an idea or suggestion related to what we had done, which I also found useful.

The biggest challenge I've given it so far was to refactor a long overdue and messy .cs file that contained about 3k LOC. I've tried this with various other AI LLMs, including Claude Code (which couldn't read the entire file as it was over 25k tokens), but they just ultimately make bugs and mess things up when trying to do so. I didn't think GPT-5 would be any different, but my god, it surprised me again. I planned with it, did it in small bits and pieces at a time, and a day or so later I'm now down to around 1k LOC for that file. It seems to be working fine too.

I've been using Claude primarily since Sonnet 3.5, and GPT models before Sonnet 3.5, but it looks like I'm back with OpenAI again unless Anthropic "wow" me back.

For Codex CLI, I would recommend checking out the "just-every/code" fork. Much nicer UI, /plan, /solve, /code commands, multiple themes, integrated browser capability, can resume previous conversations.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I remember the same thing happened during covid, he was ranting about this study that showed young boys being hospitalized with myocarditis after getting the vaccine. Following this, the Science Vs podcast invited the author of the study to talk about it. And the author explained that any adverse reaction in children studies, even minor ones like a heightened temperature, has them hospitalized out of an abundance of caution. And that the kids went home the next day after taking nothing more than ibuprofen.

The thing that irked me about it was that Rogan could have easily had this doctor on his show - the biggest podcast in the world - and asked him direct questions about the study. Instead, he spoke about it like he knew what he was talking about it, and never showed the curiousity to actually ask the people involved - who were more than willing to go on podcasts and talk about their work.</div>

Searching your messages is currently a text search, but if you have embeddings you can do semantic search. I.e. "I need all the addresses that have been shared with me". 

Which lets you quickly build context locally, i.e. for an agent that needs to "understand" your local data, without sending it all to the server to classify.</div>

Developers can use the full 768-dimension vector for maximum quality or truncate it to smaller dimensions (128, 256, or 512) for increased speed and lower storage costs.

That is pretty neat. If the improvements over e5-large hold true in application, this might be pretty useful.</div>

When not working, the two founders slept on air mattresses and pondered the fledgling business’s potential.

Proven completely wrong by reasoning models like o1, o3, Deepseek R1, and Gemini 2.5.

                        <div class="comment-body">Dead internet is inevitable because too many parties benefit from fake online voices and AI.

Perfect for spreading propaganda through social media. You want something to become normalized? Just have hundreds of thousands of bots post about how that thing should be normal. 

Want to sell your product? Just have thousands of bots all talking about how incredible your product is. Flood the internet with fake ranking websites that place your product at the top. Create hundreds of fake blogs all raving about your product. Send your bots to those sites and suddenly it's the first thing search engines suggest.

Wages in your country not good enough to survive? Create thousands of bots in video games to collect and sell currency to players who don't want to grind. Have AI create YouTube videos for ad revenue. 

Want to be famous? Purchase a ton of bots to follow you on social media. Then have more bots go around and mention you every possible chance they get. Now you have inflated following from the bots and you gain more and more as they convince others to follow you.</div>

Ghislaine was just the fun aunty who never saw anything sketchy going on despite dozens of reports of her being the madam for Jeff. Mojitos Jeffy!

Jeff was a conspiracy of one and became rich by being a good maths teacher like a Good Will Hunting plot, he became rich enough to buy islands and planes and curry the favour of current and later presidents despite noone quite explaining what his role was or why he was involved with these influential people. He was just really fun to be around!

This alliance includes representatives of Russia, the Republican Party of the USA, British and European conservative circles, as well as their associates from various countries. Among them are populists, far-right, nationalists, communists and others. Their goal is the destruction of democratic societies and the suppression of democratic movements around the world.

They are secretly subjecting people with democratic beliefs and outstanding intellectual and creative abilities to repression. These people are subjected to psychological pressure, which demotivates them, leads to mental disorders and even suicide.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It looks like he got a hair transplant at some point to fill in his original hairline when it first started receding, this is why you see defined hair along the old hairline still. But it doesn't seem like he did any of the other stuff after that, take finasteride, apply minoxidil etc to prevent further loss. So now his natural hairline is still receding, but those little guys they transplanted from the back of his scalp are still doing great up front, holding the line. 

With as much money as he has, I don't know why he doesn't just do another transplant and use the meds. Or just shave. But leaving it in-between is pretty odd looking.</div>
