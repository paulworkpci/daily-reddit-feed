Search for "old" or "used" instead for example. Unlike "vintage", " old" is often used by people that don't know what they have.

This ofcourse applies to several genres of used buying with different searchwords.

I think is it possible to train you mind to see if a photo or video is AI generated but it's the basic prerequisite is a gift that not everyone has to the same degree.

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;i think its possible to train your mind to tell if an image or video is AI generated or not

sure, its possible NOW. there's subtle tells and artifacts, some of which you pick up subconciously. i know this.

and the people that make AI generators know this. and the people that make AI generators want to improve their AI generators. theese artifacts are "bugs" that will be "patched out". don't sink too much time into sussing out the tells, because eventually the tells will cease to be.

if you can point to an AI generated piece and be like "this has a distinct AI tell", then AI engineers can do *the exact same thing*, and *fix* it

say for example, AI engineers had enough of 6 finger hands, so they tell the AI "if you are generating an image that contains a hand; count the fingers. if the hand has an abnormal amount of fingers; ditch the picture and generate a new one."

if there is a way to AUTOMATICALLY tell an AI generated image apart from a non-AI image, then you could implement that *into the AI itself*. now the AI knows to ditch any photo or video that triggers the AI detection. and we are back to square one.

"the physics and movement in this video is unnatural" ok, use an AI to detect unnatural movement, implement it into the AI, and when it detects unnatural movement; regenerate the video untill it doesn't. i fully believe this will happen eventually. and the *bug* of " i can tell that this is AI-generated" will be *patched*.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm not sure anyone expected them to be marketable and packaged as products in such a beta testing incremental way. I remember it being discussed like it, AI, would be contained in one room and airgapping and limiting access etc. Instead it's taking up acres of space and requires teams and teams of technicians and maintenance staff just for the hardware. 

I was just reading about how rlhf is likely part of the reason llms can't say i don't know and are probably also the reason they are so agreeable even when that lowers the quality of outputs.

I find it odd such frontier science is completely captured by business. I mean I guess that's the case most of the time but for AI with its unique profile it manifests in the airy fairy world of customer feedback being baked into the science, not just the tech, as a fundamental part of the process of creating it.

I always figured it would be scienced by scientists at an institution like CERN. Gov, bus partnership that does pure science first and the packaging of the science into products comes later. Not just the theory, but creating and manipulating its practical implementation for science and to better understand it before release into the wild. What a sweet summer child I was! 

It seems the profit motive was too easy to reach and we're getting the low hanging fruit as a result. In terms of product as well as safety.</div>

Every other problem it can reason through. It's bad at pathfinding, so it drew itself an ASCII map. Its bad at image recognition, but it can reason what something is eventually. It records coordinates of entrances, it can come up with good plans.

  
The problem is it can't keep track of all this. It even has a program where it faithfully records this stuff, in a fairly organized and helpful fashion; but it never actually consults its own notes and applies them to its actions, because it doesn't remember to.

  
The fact that it has to think about each individual button press is also a killer. That murders context really quickly, filling it with garbage.</div>

If this is the case, I'd like to see Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental 01-21 give this pokemon paythrough a try. It isn't as smart as Claude but is smart enough and has a massive 1 million token context length. Hell, even Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental 02-05 might do a better job given it has literally twice the token context length at 2 million</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I disagree. It can progress just fine with the memory it has, it just progresses very slowly.

The main problem right now is that its vision is so bad it can't distinguish:

- Normal bushes from cuttable bushes

- Stairs

- Its own sprite from other NPC sprites

If it could see the cuttable bushes, it would have already progressed and completed about half the game at the very least.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The problem is that these models can't do actual in context learning like we humans can do. They recognize patterns yes, but they never build the abstractions on top of this. A human would build routines and subroutines in their head so that they only have to think about the big picture tasks but Claude is stuck "manually" pressing down,down,down,right,a for every little step it wants to take.
It would need the power to save learned things and re-use them later. Ideally at coarser and coarser levels of abstraction.</div>

It doesn't matter how smart you are, if you lose the memory of the way out in the time it takes to walk there.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Soon there'll be a time where it'll be illegal for doctors to work without AI. And a short time later they'll be replaced. Remember how barbers used to be dentist. Present doctors will be perceived like that.
Doctors, lawyers, teachers and accountants are in my top 10 which'll be replaced easily by AI.  It's just the nature of their work. Just cramming a load of data and based on situation, finding which piece fits best. AI is made for this exact kind of work.  Moreover they are limited by experience. A doctor may meet 10k-100k peopl in his life. AI model will have access to millions of people's data. And plus point, It doesn't forget anything. Once learned the entire species knows it in an instant. While we have to slave away a quarter of our life every  generation trying to learn everything from scratch.


There will be consultants. To deal with new situations. But not everyone can be a consultant.</div>

People uncomfortable with AI are always going to want to speak to a person about their diagnosis, even if an AI is involved. Will the total demand drop? Maybe. Will their salaries go down?

The input image is 64x64 which is small by today's standards. It seems incredibly unlikely that the change would result in a +35% gain in accuracy. I've seen a number of these types of papers with hyperbolic results. My prediction is it results in... nothing.</div>

Folks here and other platforms always seem like they need their hands held in order to do anything. 

It almost seems like these folks would squirm if they taste alcohol or panic if they get lost in public without a guardian.

Personally I am a bit afraid of ordering food at a restaurant, but that doesn't prevent me from actually doing it, nor would you actually tell by looking at me. It is just a bunch of tiny fears that I have to push through every time I order food.

The medium of communication removes all nuance and that combined with people only telling one side of a story that is laced with feelings and not facts tend to paint a very black and white picture.</div>

The universe being an engine of complexity that builds on itself exponentially to the point that it's happening before our very eyes and things begin to become more and more absurd.

Of course Musk lost his fucking shit on them. Guy is and always was a clown.

I don’t think she fantasizes about me the way I fantasize about her. I fantasize about her body. She fantasizes about the way I kiss the back of her neck when I’m behind her or the way I grab her hips and ass when she’s on top of me.</div>

Hi all, been a bit since I went long, had to go to Medium with this as it's too lengthy for here.

I happened to catch a tweet from somebody named Stew Peters who claimed that two very important documents were missing, those being testimony given by longtime lead CIA Counterintelligence officer James Angleton, who was part of the OSS and then the CIA until he was forced to resign in ’74 after Watergate, as well as Angleton’s confidante Newton “Scooter” Miler, who many have long thought to be Source-1 behind the most Majestic-12 documents like the “Burned Memo” and “Important Memo” that Miler himself possibly saved when many of Angleton’s documents were being burned after his death in ’87 and later passed on to Timothy Cooper.

Some of you might remember the work of u/harry_is_white_hot, a legend in these subs. You can read about his takes on Angleton and Miler here:

If you’ve been deep in this sub, you’ll remember the work that harry and u/36_39_42 have done in putting together much of the 1933 Magenta, Italy UFO crash-retrieval case that David Grusch was cleared to talk about when he first came forward. (Fun fact, looks like 36 and I are going forward with a documentary project about this!)

                                <div class="reply-body">OP's claim is that [this tweet](https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1902422035227197695), from a guy named Stew Peters, shows the record number for a file that can't be found in the release. But that's untrue. That file is [right here](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2025/0318/157-10014-10006.pdf). So while I generally appreciate OP's work, this particular article is completely incorrect.

As an aside: This "Stew Peters" guy seems to be a rabid anti-semite. Yikes.

Another aside: I now see the word "Temporarily" before the word "missing" in the title of this post and the article it links to. I don't remember seeing that earlier. Not sure.

Final aside: [Further discussion with OP](https://old.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1jhm7u1/temporarily_missing_documents_from_the_recent_jfk/mja7exb/) clarifying that he isn't claiming the file is still missing, he in fact used it in his article. My mistake, and my apologies.</div>

We can only make about 1 million high-end chips a year, and growth is slow,  we need to build new fabs which is also very slow and expensive. 

I roughly estimate 1 AI chip for 1 human job automated, given that AI needs many more tokens for reasoning mode, but can generate more tokens than a human. We also need to consider real time video costs, which is too expensive to serve today. So it's a wash.

I did some math, estimate a human at 100K words/day, while an AI chip can produce 50-100x more tokens per day. When you factor in reasoning, multimodality and strict real time demands it makes sense 1 job =~ 1 chip.</div>

\[Advice\] I'm 38 and finally cracked the discipline code after failing for 15+ years. Here's the system that changed everything.

\[Advice\] I’m 34 and finally cracked the discipline code after a decade of fake starts. Here’s what actually worked.

Both of them are the same, only worded differently. I am getting sick of this type of content. People are going to end up backing off from anything AI.

They think it is funny to experiment, they think they will eventually find some "money glitch" or marketing hack or whatever. Nauseating.</div>

I was thinking as I initially scrolled by that it's stuff like this that is killing reddit and the rest of the remaining Internet for me. It's just cannibalized and regurgitated content. Nothing interesting anymore. </div>
