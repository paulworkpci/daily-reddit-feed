workflow that genuinely improves my productivity rather than just being a novelty:

Tools I'm using:

- GitHub Copilot for in-editor suggestions (still the best for real-time)

- Claude Code for complex refactoring tasks (better than GPT-4o for this specific use
case)

- GPT-4o for debugging and explaining unfamiliar code

- Cursor.sh when I need more context window than VS Code provides

- Replit's Ghost ...</div>

One of the VPs gets flack for something that was done that shouldn't have happened. They then unleash their angry tirade on some middle level manager laden with the worst assumptions of the employee responsible.

And like clockwork, approaching the employee and asking for the full story almost always goes one of 3 ways.

And as middle management, you tend to have to be that buffer zone where you can take that moment to intake the info and then go down the line finding out more so you have the full picture and not just the gut angry reaction from above.  

I too have found that there's usually more to it than "Oops, I forgot to..." but even when it's that situation, going into it from an inquisitive standpoint versus and aggressive one is how you get buy-in from your team for sure.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, I have had this mindset as a manager for a long time. I started viewing everyone's mistakes as "there's probably a good reason as to why this particular thing happened" instead of texting the manager group chat "WHO TF CLOSED LAST NIGHT?"

I work in restaurants and it seems to be a common thing for managers to approach everything from a *negative* point of view rather than a positive one. If there's something not done right, if there are ever *any* issues that happen, they just start from "this was done because of incompetency" or "this was done *maliciously* / *on purpose*" and it's really frustrating. Additionally, a lot of managers will nitpick every single little thing that doesn't get done and bitch about it. All it does is *create* conflict and animosity between managers when we start from the position of pointing the finger and blaming someone. When I encounter things not done from the closing shit when I open, I just deal with it and move on. A lot of managers will write a goddamn manifesto because a fork was on the floor in dish or one of the drains wasn't cleaned properly.

Relevant story about this: A few months ago, I had another manager just absolutely lose it in the group chat because I had forgotten to follow up with someone to make sure that we had potatoes prepped. I simply had not been told that this was a reoccurring issue and I also had no idea that this was done during my shifts rather than during the day. Optimally, he should have shot me a direct 1-on-1 text and said something like, "Oh hey, by the way, when you close on Thursdays, make sure these racks are full of potatoes. It makes it difficult when there aren't enough potatoes and one of the kitchen has to go back and prep some. I'm sure you weren't aware and just wanted to make sure you knew. I'll see you at noon, bro!" 

Instead, this manager opted to go into the group chat and start getting violently hostile saying shit like "so are we going to start doing potatoes on thursday night or are we too busy doing schedules in the office during volume?" I wanted to lose my fucking shit in the group chat at him and had a whole aggressive ass response typed up and instead I was like "Hey, sorry, I was looking at it last night and I saw several trays there and thought they were good to go. I haven't been told that this was an issue on Thursday nights, sorry. I'm in at noon and I'll prep some myself." To which he replies with a picture of an empty rack. Turns out they stocked the line with the potatoes that I had seen previously and I did not realize that they hadn't stocked them up front yet. Genuine mistake on my part and I tell him "Sorry, I guess they must have stocked the ones that I saw, that's my bad." And then he replies, "Heard. I'm going to go up to the line and check and see if there are 200 potatoes up there."

He was a complete ass for absolutely zero reason. I called my Director immediately and sent him a screenshot of what was said. I had never been treated like that by another manager (on the same level) before. I was also so fucking pissed that I didn't go in until after the other manager had left because I knew that we would get into it if we crossed paths and most likely end in both of us getting fired.

I: 1) apologized, 2) recognized that I made a mistake, 3) gave an action plan on how to fix said mistake, 4) made another action plan on how to prevent this from happening on any night that I close ever again, yet he was still so unnecessarily aggressive and hostile for literally no reason. That next Thursday, I even stayed until 1AM to make sure that that potato rack was completely full. I didn't have to, but I did it because I don't like to make mistakes more than I hate being petty over stupid shit.</div>

I once had a manager who was so up his own ass about corporate speak and not using any negative language whatsoever that I came to him once and told him "Hey, we've got a problem-" and before I could tell him what the issue was, he cut me off with "We don't have *problems*! We have opportunities for improvement!" I looked him straight in the eye and responded "Okay. We have an opportunity to improve the restroom by cleaning up the shit that's smeared all over the walls, and it's not going to be me." He very noticeably stopped with the toxic positivity after that incident.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's really just a mantra that you chant in your mind, not out loud.  I came up with my own mantra, which is just "Shaaam." I don't know any of the "sacred" Sanskrit phrases or mantras; I just came up with something that felt relaxing to chant internally.  The most typical one you'll hear of is the ubiquitous "aum".

From what I've gathered, it's just a mantra that you repeat internally without focus—the more you focus, the more you stay on the surface, from my experience.  I've noticed that when you eventually repeat the mantra for long enough, it becomes abstract and you start feeling a sense of "transcendence," I suppose lol

Many practitioners of TM/NSR/etc say that the mantra must be a non-meaning word, and I think that's the most important part.  If your mantra has no meaning, it makes it easier for you to sink into that nothingness.  If you associate your mantra with something (a person, a food, a place) you'll tend to focus on said thing, rather than actually sinking deeper into the meditation.

Speaking from personal experience only, I'm not a meditation teacher or anything, I still need to learn much more, just sharing personal insights.</div>

A guy called me from there and said yes I see where we messed up, I can offer you a one-time credit of $120 (nowhere near the benefit that they’d messed up). Pretty much said to suck it up otherwise. 

I filed an FCC complaint and reached out to customer service again. Once I mentioned the FCC complaint, they sent me right over to a supervisor. He wasn’t able to fix the original problem, but he was able to offer another solution that benefited me more than the original deal would have.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don't know about you Yanks, but when we discuss this exact thing in Sweden, it's one of the most divisive discussions we have where people are absolutely rabid and sat in their ways on both sides. It's our very own little Israel vs Palestine.

We have around 400 wolves in Sweden, according to google. The hunters and reindeer farmers fucking hate wolves, with their entire being, more than anything else in this world. They want to eradicate them from the earth, every last one of them, legit hate in their hearts for the wolves. Then on the opposite side of the isle you have the people who aren't directly affected but are environmentalists that care about the overall ecosystem who are very pro wolves. 

Then you have the majority, the people in bigger cities that don't actually know much about the debate(like me) or are affected by wolves at all who chime in and stick their fingers in the cake. It's always a good show where people want to tear off each others faces.

Edit:

 To add more context to the 400 number, we decided to cull a lot of them this year, and they're considered endangered. In contrast, Romania has 6000 wolves. Poland has 2000 wolves in 1/3 the area. Italy has 3300. Spain 2500. 
A lot of criticism has gone against the hunting side of the isle for killing the wolves instead of capturing them and releasing them in the rest of Europe, who have big issues with incest and inbreeding. 

It's a very interesting debate, both sides have very valid arguments in my opinion.</div>

I bet things get weird if you let it continue, like the AI hallucinations start and it breaks the laws of physics that don't exist in AI world.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I have mentioned this in other posts but I have a pretty standard test I give all models involving scrabble.  This is the first model to absolutely ace it.  It sat there for -10 minutes- thinking, then spat out two files (one with the code, one with the tests) and they worked first time perfectly.  No other model has gotten there the first time (I think o3 came close on my initial test).

Not only did it solve it, but it did it elegantly.  The code is solid (especially compared to the huge verbose code gemini produces), and it did something smart none of the other models achieved (being vague to not influence any future testing I do).

So far this is now the best model I've ever tested (on this one specific coding test).</div>

I asked it to improve the graphics in a game my daughter and I did in python with 2.5 pro and it managed to do so quite well. It flawlessly added 1000 lines of code and the graphics got some cooler effects and shadows and a bit of anti aliasing like effects. It is three separate games in one so its pretty cool to see that it managed to improve all three games without issues. Quite alot of code though as the game went from 700 lines to 1700 :)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I wish we lived in a world that was rational with this stuff.

The US is very reactionary, not pro active. As a country polices and plans are rarely put into place before the need for it. This is why the infrastructure, Internet in rural areas and an ungodly amount of other things are always kicked down the road.

I wish I could see a future where UBI was even half hazardly considered, but the US is a country of pure greed and we definitely don't look after citizens. You will not see a form of UBI until it reaches a point where it should have been implemented 10 years prior.

I don't even think the people that currently are in a position of power to make these changes even know how to implement something like this. It would require a complete restructuring of the entire economy. Very few people in charge are competent enough to spearhead this change. It's more than just giving people money too. How do you prevent housing prices from skyrocketing when landlords know you have a guaranteed income? The same with every other company trying to make a profit. These problems aren't even being addressed *without* UBI now.

It sounds very doomish but I think we might all sooner see the collapse of the entire economy before UBI happens.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The problem is the transition. We will not have a post scarcity economy right as people begin to lose their jobs. And even then it’ll take some time, because it requires mass automation and advanced robotics.

You can tax companies that lay off workers and opt for AI and funnel that into unemployment/UBI. But who knows how demand will react to mass unemployment and mass uncertainty. And who knows how financial markets and prices will react to all of that.

While I do think UBI will be the solution that works well eventually, the transition could be rough. But yes people need to start taking this seriously and start coming up with solutions.</div>

&gt;Numerous top military officials have expressed their desire to protect and increase foreign aid, as highlighted by a letter sent to House and Senate leaders: “For every $1 spent on conflict prevention, we save $16 in response costs and avoid sending our troops into harm’s way.”

Again, not defending AIPAC's grip on the US in particular, but "Any foreign aid higher than $0 is too much" is ignorant.</div>

It's just too bad that they're coming into the industry with not much. They don't have data centers nor the compute or a SOTA model of their own. They're trying to run AI on the iPhone due to privacy but that's no where near enough compute. Siri is a joke.

I don't see Apple being able to match that unless they were to partner with one of the big LLMs, and I'm not sure of any of them that aren't already integrated elsewhere other than Grok/X. Not sure how much of Apple's consumer market would be into that.</div>
