Researchers developed a pooled CRISPR-Cas12a technique that can create long, precisely targeted DNA deletions across many sites in the genome simultaneously. This makes it possible to study or reprogram complex genetic networks far more efficiently than before, accelerating large-scale genome engineering and automated bio-design — both of which are crucial for merg...</div>

this might be a bit of an odd question, but I’ve been feeling like a bit of a fraud lately and wanted to know if anyone else can relate.

For context: I study computer science at a fairly good university in Austria. I finished my bachelor’s in the minimum time (3 years) and my master’s in 2, with a GPA of 1.5 (where 1 is best and 5 is worst), so I’d say I’ve done quite well academically. I’m about to hand in my master’s thesis and recently started applying for jobs.

I look at it this way: Does the farmer feel like a fraud because they use large equipment to tend to hundreds of acres of land, when "clearly they should be using oxen and a shear plow"? (Or, perhaps, hand tools?)</div>

I think that analogy is smuggling in some assumptions. If we talk about scale, current LLMs really fall apart at scale. I think that they are much more analogous to the oxen and shear plow in your comparison. LLMs can take an unaided beginner from zero/extremely low productivity up to a reasonable, workable level. But as of now, it seems to me that the ability to build large, high quality software products depends on real skill in software engineering. Many people here are experienced SWEs who take for granted the skills they've acquired through years of grinding and immersion in code, which beginners like OP are at risk of failing to develop.

OP, in my view, feeling like a "fraud" is a category error. You're doing your best, and certainly ChatGPT couldn't produce anything like your master's thesis on its own. So be proud of what you've done, it's not fraudulent. However, I do think that if you're rarely writing any code by hand, you're probably losing something, and you may be hamstringing your development. 

Imagine, five years down the line, two versions of you and ask yourself which you'd rather be. In one version, you kept a bit of time aside every week to focus on coding completely unaided, developing deep instincts about the code at *multiple* levels of abstraction while you do so. In this scenario, you didn't *stop* using AI, you just put some time aside to keep and develop a foundation of independent confidence and expertise. In the other version, you spent those five years purely vibe coding. Over time your knowledge of language syntax might erode, and you'll never really have engaged fully with the ins and outs of the specific logic of the code you've written. You get used to writing your queries in natural language, taking AI outputs (which become increasingly like black boxes as your degrees recede into history) and running tests on them, feeding back to the AI until you get something working. Which version of yourself do you think will be more comfortable and confident when the team decides it is finally time to stop incrementally adding features to their 1M loc legacy codebase and do a major refactor, putting you in charge of it? Who'll be more confident answering to stakeholders, assisting juniors in pair programming sessions, and driving a consistent vision across the codebase? Remember, both versions will have access to GPT-10 and all the latest new fangled agentic frameworks etc.

To me it's a question of whether you're willing to gamble on the kinds of skills that differentiate programmers from any random person off the street becoming irrelevant. It's possible that is a scenario that occurs, in which case maintaining or developing SWE skills is redundant. If that's the case, I'm not clear how you'd have been especially *disadvantaged* by maintaining the skills. In that scenario, it's a difficult position to be in either way, because you'll have waded into a field where labour supply is extremely high, and as a result, very cheap. If on the other hand the great "AGI revolution" is even 15 years away instead of 5, the opportunity cost to losing out on those skills seems enormous to me personally.</div>

A lot of companies are allowing ai to be used during interviews, and asking much harder questions to see how well you can steer the AI into the correct fix. 

One piece of advice would be to start using an IDE, with coding agents like Augment Code or ZenCoder. It’s much more efficient and can quickly give you information about your entire code base.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Definitely seems like the future especially with the success of the follistatin gene therapy recently. 

However, I'd bet we are a ways off this being accessible. The main risk is that you could produce too much and parallelize your gut and see other side effects. I get that an antibiotic could inhibit it, but the risk of over production just seems too high. 

Should would be nice if we could just elevate everybody's GLP-1 level to like 0.25 mg indefinitely. Could probably solve obesity just with that. As someone who lost alot of weight on tirzepetide and have been off it for a year, I can confirm that it works. I know maintenance is the recommendation but I sure don't want to inject myself every week or pay for it indefinitely.</div>

The second statement doesn't directly follow from the first, and is more like a footnote or an exception. It would make more sense to say "To change the past is to unmake the present. However, you'll remember the life you wished away." Or something like that.

Also it doesn't make sense to say "You will remember both." In this context, the person being spoken to can remember the timeline they're leaving, because it'll be terminated or paused, but they'll be actively living and experiencing the new timeline.

The writing in general seems too minimal and bare. I don't use AI for writing so I cannot judge it in comparison with other models, or if prompting in a certain way would produce better results.</div>

I imagine it will sell much better than the EV variants but without a cheaper ICE model, it still won't compare to the previous gen.

Even IF EV sales increased at the speed they were previously; there's no way the coupe EV would sell the most of all four varients. Should have lead with the coupe ICE, then the sedan ICE and EV, and then the coupe EV</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly if the EV variants were actually the most powerful and quickest for their price class they would have sold a lot better. Just made no sense the way they launched it to ask for huge amounts of money for a car that would get walked by a bunch of cheaper EVs. Who wants to drive around with fake rev noises only to get walked by a random Tesla?!

At least Stellantis seems to get that their pricing has been horrible on these cars and seems to be trying to deliver something that seems like a deal this time. I still think it’s going to be a much more niche car than the old Charger though</div>

It just looks so... pedestrian. Like nothing about this car screams performance except for the hood. 

It almost reminds me of the current gen Accord vs the previous gen Accord. They just smoothed over the lines and made the car look more dull compared to the previous gen.</div>

Yeah, sure until you hit run.

Now you got 20 lines of errors from code you didn’t even fully understand because, surprise, the AI hallucinated half the logic.
You spend the next 3 hours debugging, refactoring, and trying to figure out why your “10-second script” just broke your entire environment.

Do you guys use ai heavily as well because of deadlines?

My experience has been that a lot of people just suck at written communication. Tie that in with not really understanding how to use AI, know the various prompting techniques and when and where to use them and you're going to run into a lot of problems.</div>

One, it gives enough range of motion to squat, jump, etc. You could also get that by leaving the gap exposed, see Boston Dynamics various humanoid bots, but if you're covering it to keep debris out you need to account for it.


Two, they didn't realize how noticeable it would be until after it was fully assembled and it was too late/expensive to craft another one for what genuinely isnt a problem- we're allowed to objectify literal objects.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">XPeng is already selling cars world wide, including to Europe and to Australia.

It's amazing that some people would think XPeng would use an actual human to fake a robot they have been working on, especially when [XPeng has demoed the previous Iron](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TFi2nIwQo00).

Like the harm to XPeng's reputation if they decided to use a real human being in place of an actual robot, would hurt their reputation and sales world wide, so much more than if they didn't enter the humanoid robot industry in the first place.</div>
