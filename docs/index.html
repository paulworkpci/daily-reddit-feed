                                <div class="reply-body">I’ve seen Eric Schmidt at a private event, and walked away thinking… anyone with above average intelligence, some decent communication skills, and the right time and place mixed with the right kind of privilege (reasonable education, right connections, inherent biases, upbringing, etc.) could have been CEO of Google. He was surprisingly unimpressive and disconnected from understanding much of what he was talking about. Intelligence, and insight did not stand out at all. I did not witness thoughtfulness.

Maybe he is just too removed from real work to know… but I’m certain there are thousands of more capable and qualified people who have not gotten the opportunity to be CEO. Impressive accomplishment, but since then I questioned if leaders are as capable as they present externally. I’m not a naive person; the gap/chasm just turned out to be much larger than I expected. Leaders in a number of smaller companies were more impressive to me - perhaps a person bias of my own.</div>

Which, honestly, is shockingly sad behaviour. Bro, you’re a multi-billionaire. Have the tiny amount of balls required to hold your own frame instead of trying to impress randos and accidentally appear even more sociopathic than you already do. 

It’s like Zuck trying to appear cool for Rogan. It’s such sad behaviour. You’d think at a certain level you’re able to confidently do your own thing instead of trying to look cool in front of the school jock.</div>

We all carry internal "stories": "I'm not good at X," "I always mess up Y," "I'll never achieve A." Sound familiar?
The crucial thing is, many of these narratives were written years ago by a younger, less experienced version of you, often based on old fears or limited information. That "past self" did their best, but they didn't have the wisdom or experience you have now.

The LPT here is to consciously question these ingrained stories. Ask yourself:
Is this still true for the person I...</div>

The take away should be, stop being so negative with yourself. If you have weaknesses, then recognize it and actively take steps to work on it. Stop shitting on yourself though. Recognize those things that need work and make a step by step plan to work on them, and then do it. If you don't know how, ask for help (from someone who can actually help you, not some random or family member that can only listen, but not actually help).</div>

I would add that you learn a lot by making mistakes. I know someone who only does things when they're a slam dunk sure thing. That means he mostly does nothing and learns nothing.

                        <div class="comment-body">I am not sure if I am getting this the way you meant. 

I am petrified of public speaking and am also a bit of an introvert. Most of my colleagues were even more petrified so I ended up giving a lot of technical presentations, and eventually working trade shows and giving speeches.

I was not comfortable at all the whole time, but became good at acting open and affable. People would even comment how natural and approachable I was. It was never natural, and required overcoming some major insecurities.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Sounds like you faced a big fear and have achieved some success at something you were initially petrified to do. Even better that others recognize your skills. 

The happiness OP is talking about isn’t necessarily about liking the specific uncomfortable thing; the happiness comes from the pride of facing a fear, the effort you put into the challenge, and from the knowledge you can do hard, scary things. These moments build confidence and resilience, and lead to more satisfaction in life.

I hope this was helpful!</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hey all, I think about this anytime a classic car drives by and leaves that heavenly smell that just lights up my brain with contentment, nostalgia, and calm. It takes me back to when I was a kid a didn't have to worry about anything.

What is the cause for the smell? Is it just because theres no cat? I assume they're not all running 0E or leaded fuel or anything like that.

Is there a specific cause or set of chemicals that give off that distinct smell? And can I make a candle out of it?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes. Modern cars will still briefly put out this smell on a cold start because the catalyst needs to warm up to be effective, but once it does, it turns (most of) those unburnt hydrocarbons into fully burnt hydrocarbons and the smell is gone.

edit: I really hate the no-cat car exhaust smell, but two-stroke exhaust really gets me going in the same way. Which is fun since it's even worse for you than uncatalyzed car exhaust!</div>

So I've been in a huge rut for 8 years. I've had no friends and I've spent 100% of my days bed rotting. No hobbies, no job. I couldn't bring myself to "just do it": message that person on Bumble BFF, apply to that job, cook, start any hobby, etc. I've grown up with zealously overprotective parents who did everything for me (chores, choosing my high school classes, choosing my university program, etc) so I was basically handicapped. I lived every day miserable and ashamed, spinning ...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Hello, I actually did the 10 day Vipassana retreat in 2015 and I really think there’s something not right with me because not only did I not have any of the benefits of Vipassana (state of flow, quieting the mind, etc…), but I also did not experience the negative aspects (pain from sitting for 8 hrs/day, experiencing the stuff that comes up, etc…). All this to say that for a certain group of people (such as me) meditation may not work. I think I am completely numb. Anyone else have this experience?</div>

I doubt that these people are nearly as brain dead as they say they are and I also highly doubt that any anesthesia is used.  EDIT: I also just found out that organ harvesting tables have straps to prevent involuntary muscle movements from interfering with the surgery or in the rare case when the brain dead patient is able to leap from the table. When they suck out your bone marrow you are probably screeching and throwing your arms around like Terri schiavo rather than laying still like a slaughtered cow</div>

The night after he's found dead splatted on the street. They said he must have jumped from the window on the 13th floor, but I know him and I'm certain he would never have done that. Always suspected organ harvesting. It's the only logical reason, but my dumb family refuses to see it. They are more consoled by the fact that he jumped because of some pain medication delirium.</div>

They've been trained to think everyone is against them due to some grand conspiracy and not due to trump being idiotically self serving and a malignant cancer on the democratic process 

He got his Messianic appeal to them the moment he survived by turning his head and so now it's religious fervor

                        <div class="comment-body">I actually think this a huge problem.. like, yes AI will definitely challenge the need for many the low and probably even average skilled in many professions, but there might still be something interesting about the most brilliant humans in every field. But they don’t usually come out brilliant straight of the box (when they graduate). They still need time to do their 10,000 hours and develop their skills.. we are about to lose that pipeline.

So right now we might say AI isn’t replacing our best writers, artists, programmers etc. but we are going to have a problem in a few decades when we don’t have new talent being brought up.</div>

It also assumes how junior people are currently trained is the optimum way to make someone an expert. I don’t this is true either. In most professions I’m aware of junior people are “trained” by just doing all the mundane shit no one else wants to do, because there’s no one else to do it. 

We could definitely create more effective ways of transferring only expert knowledge, within the context that AI will do the rest.</div>

It is utterly frightening that this is hailed as an advancement for humanity. Mankind has proven that it will exploit any resources to gain benefits. It does not take much super-villain thought to realise the manipulative power of such technology.

Rather then wasting time on the 10 and fatiguing I do 5,5,15,5. After the squats it seemed enough to get right back to it. Obviously gonna feel different with the vest but I only had a 2-3 min difference on 20 rounds with the vest. It’s the last run that kills ya. 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🔥🔥🔥🔥 let’s go!!

If you are going to do 20 rounds of Cindy you may want to consider 5-5-15-5, splitting the pushups into 2 sets of 5 around the squats for the same reason.</div>

First I restart at an earlier prompt.  I typically request that when debugging, do not rely on your initial assumptions.  Instead, review the code carefully, develop an understanding of the functional intent and current outcome.   Establish at least 5 potential causes - review the code against your 5 predictions and narrow down to the most likely cause before continuing.  


If I can't be bothered to review the code myself, I will sometimes start a new session with Claude in the role of a code reviewer tasked with simply reviewing the code for alignment with best practices / look for potential errors etc.   I have a giant prompt for this I won't. Paste here, but a code reviewer is a great way to highlight potentially problematic pieces.   

I specifically ask it not to propose fixes during the review.</div>

The issue is almost always in the logic between various functions. You need to be very specific when it’s outputting code and have to actually understand on some level what it’s outputting to see if it followed instructions.
