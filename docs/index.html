                                <div class="reply-body">It's so funny. They keep trying new elements and posting extra videos to make it hard for people to call it fake, cgi or ai generated.

Some people thought the first dancing video was fake, so they posted [another video](http://xhslink.com/a/zEam9blFQxo8) with a mirror behind the robot while they hit it with balls and sticks.

Same thing for the kung fu video, so they posted [another video](http://xhslink.com/a/AwY6ZkrYyzo8) but with the ceo in frame interacting with it.

For the side-flip video, they just had someone firing [confetti](https://youtu.be/29xLWhqME2Q?si=8hvp6ZjJ1ch_HcvU) at it.

And for this most recent one, they have people in the background and interacting with the robot again, and now they finally added text.

Some people will still think they're fake, even with all that. But as more companies showcase the same capabilities, like in that recent Boston Dynamics video, it'll just keep getting harder to stay a skeptic and call them fake.</div>

AI’s applications are vast - spanning science, robotics, semiconductors, data processing, and much more. As it becomes more accessible and scalable, its potential will only expand. Non-restricted, uncensored AI models are crucial for achieving anything resembling true intelligence and for continually pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.</div>

I called the first time, they acknowledged it was a mistake, then they charged me again the following month. I had been a customer for over 20 years and they basically grifted me. Finally the customer service agent I spoke to in the last transaction corrected it, and said he has seen this happen multiple times, and Tmobile is definitely in the wrong.  Not sure if it was the whistleblower I spoke to but I hope that company gets dragged through the mud, sinks and dies, they really suck.  They also tried to send my bill to collections, so I am ready to sue if I see that come through again.</div>

"I have a Substack website that currently has 93 stories exposing T-Mobile as a whistleblower, let me list some of the big things I’ve exposed about T-Mobile so you get an idea of who you’re prosecuting based on a lie.

T-Mobile provides unlimited money for Transgender surgeries as an employee benefit

T-Mobile violated Texas Health &amp; Safety Code Chapter 81D by discriminating against me for being unvaccinated (in Collin County)

T-Mobile’s parent company created the Vaccine Passports for the World Health Organization

T-Mobile Insiders sold $5.3 billion in stock in 2024 and I was the only person to report on it

T-Mobile censored customers text messages during Covid and The Gateway Pundit wrote an article about me exposing it

T-Mobile uses Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion (DEI) to destroy America from within

T-Mobile took my TikTok from me on December 4th, 2024 after my first court date"</div>

I tried using the apps to block other apps on your phone. But I'd end up unblocking them and doing the same thing.

After a while, I figured out that if my brain does not see my phone for a while, it kinda forgets it exists. So the urge to check it disappears (comes back once you grab it tho)

Something about the finality of doing the little drawer and clicking it away just gets me. It also keeps my phone accessible but out of sight without one of those little lock boxes (that only have a limited amount of overrides). 

I've considered getting a bag pouch with a locking zipper too for the same purpose as phones get bigger and more cumbersome, with the added bonus being that I could put other tech in there as needed.</div>

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Anything that involves GTD, keeping daily todo lists, categorizing, tagging, contextualizing, pre-planning, planning, after-planning, (edit: forgot to add under-planning and sideways-planning), daily and weekly journaling and writing other kinds of essays, Eisenhower matrixing, time-blocking, calendaring, time-tracking, writing notes, *copying the last month's unfinished tasks to the new month, by HAND, with PEN, in the Bullshit Journal (it's easy and productive, no need to hire 3 people to maintain that shit, 1 full time employee and 1 intern is enough),* etc., any of that is just destructive to any resemblance of productivity for me.

What the OP is proposing though, I like it. I think I can see why this works. I will try this approach, while adjusting to some of my personal preferences and circumstances.</div>

I love OP's approach to building consistency in habits. That wasn't enough for me though. I had to change my mindset on what's important and whats not on top of habit building exercises. Discipline requires a mindset shift too - Listen to your mind, listen to your body and nurture your aspirations!</div>

A couple of extra things I do...
Do more mentally demanding things earlier in the day and easier things later. 
Minimise task switching by removing interruptions.
To do this I timebox the first 4 hours of my day to ensure I make progress on my big work items each day. Meetings go in the afternoon where possible.Only answer emails a couple of times per day. 
Take 5-10 mins break each hour to keep my productivity up through the day.</div>

Description of sighting: This user @cocosongz submitted several videos showing large orbs of light above the ocean. She states they are emerging from the water itself, then hovering above it.      

I'm curious as to whether anyone has seen these videos or similar and would like to share their thoughts, or whether there have been any explanations found. There is quite a large discussion surrounding recent sightings in this specific area, and many mentions of the presence of whistleblowers and military officials. Some even mention the belief that a large craft or "mother ship" has been found under the surface of the surrounding waters.

It's rising out of the sea (like the person in the video mentioned), with the shape, phase and even colour matching the video. 

The screenshot of the video is from the https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2GyfvWa/ video.

“I am from daytona beach, lived there my whole life before i joined the coast guard.

Disclaimer i am into ufos but im not a ufo nut throwing conspiratorial nonsense out there.

This is the most significant UFO disclosure news in years.

David Grusch is now insulated from any prosecutions via the Speech or Debate Clause Article I, Section 6, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution. This applies to congressional aides per SCOTUS.

It likely protects him not only from NDAs but also any sort of classification mumbo jumbo. He can read whatever he knows into the record.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">“I don’t think we should invade Canada or Greenland or go to war in Mexico.” is not a nonsense statement, but a legitimate political stance in 2025. 

There are some single sentences that I think are evidence of how fucked everything is, and this is one of them. 

“American citizens should not be [shipped to brutal prisons in third world countries](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/21/trump-musk-tesla-protests-el-salvador-prisons).” is one. 

“The richest man in the world, who himself has [billions in government contracts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/true-genius-elon-musk-subsidy-110500444.html), making decisions for the government after [contributing hundreds of millions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/31/elon-musk-trump-donor-2024-election) seems like it could be a little corrupt.” 

“People who [stormed the U.S. Capitol and caused evacuation during a session of congress, resulting in theft, property damage,  and deaths](https://youtube.com/shorts/9PRMK-FdeAY?si=YMoSy-Zg40ii9E02), should probably face consequences, regardless of if their views align with people in power.”

They've adapted their messaging now. Trump said the other day he'd prefer to deal with Liberals than the tough PP (rrriiiight), and now Shapiro and Rogan have softened there stance on Canada. This is despite Rogan calling us a communist hell hole and somehow knowing the conservative leaders name which is a red flag, and Shapiro threatening Canada multiple times on twitter. 

This is a propaganda arm messaging change. Rogan is not the friend of us normies. He's with the billionaire class now.</div>

To safeguard against training data contamination, I also evaluate performance exclusively on the most recent 100 puzzles. In this scenario, o1-pro remains in first place.
