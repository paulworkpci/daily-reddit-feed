However, I noticed I've became a bit lazy to program because I've already gone a couple of laps around the programming wheel already.

I don't really code a lot in this role so I had to put it down for a bit in favor of system design and infra. Now I am coming back to it after a bit of a break and the biggest reason for that is LLMs make coding actually fun and easy again.

Very thankful for this as it has inspired me to start building more projects and essentially re-lit the passion I had before.</div>

So sadly now I look at this ad and think: amazing, but probably fails in production. I might be even wrong, but I have been conditioned to think that after 2 1/2 of usage. 🫠</div>

Reminds me of Rabbit R1 too - looks awesome but in reality the advertising materials is very misleading. Too slow, too error prone, too expensive to actually make sense. All that reminds me of [General Magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Magic?wprov=sfla1). There was actually an awesome documentary on them a few years back that I heavily recommend, as it shows how being too early and being wrong are synonymous in tech sometimes.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Crazy that both shooters used old rifles too (based on the fact this is using 5 round stripper clips). That means people won't get bogged down with a push to ban AR-15s or other modern semi-auto rifles. Instead, they can focus on what's important - hating each other.


To be clear, I don't support gun bans. Just thought it was interesting that both of these happened in a way where that wouldn't even be part of the discussion.




Edit: on a second look, this might actually be a Mauser stripper clip. Did this shooter even use the same style of rifle? </div>

&gt;The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified, generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the same primitives apply to today’s generative video mo...</div>

We need a world model that continuously predicts and anticipates probable/practical futures... With the ability to test that in sim, along with the auxiliary ability to compensate for real world variables.


It's really all there already, proof of concept, it just needs to be stuck together and worked into..

So the secret source is probably not only the official OpenAI GPT-5 Prompt Guide.

1. Every LLM is trained for one style of prompt.

2. This not only applies to the user prompt, it also applies to System-Prompt, Tool-Presentation and Environment-Listing

3. Especial Anthropic-Style differs in huge manner from others. This is one of the reasons why coders like Cline still have quality issues with Non-Claude LLMs

4. Gpt-5-Codex does not support Completion API, it is Responses API only. If you just try to adapt your legacy completion call to responses, you might degrade in quality. Responses e.g. manages reuse of thinking tokens and so on. 

So just using the new model does not bring the full features and quality to your coder. The coders are just a very (!) thin layer of Tools and UI above the LLMs, but they need to fit.</div>

"The Trump team announced that he would be on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast October 25.

That came as a surprise to us. I'd been told that Joe Rogan couldn't interview me on that date because he was "taking a personal day."

We'd been back and forth with Rogan since late September or early October. One of the young leaders on my digital team made the initial contact through Rogan's platform, Spotify.

                        <div class="comment-body">After my C5 was totaled by a red light runner, right after the C7 was announced, my father convinced me to buy the first new car anyone in our immediate family had purchased in probably a few decades, and then convinced me to do the museum delivery.

This worked out in a few really cool ways. My pick-up date happened not long after the sinkhole occurred, so I got to see it first hand. It made a hugely memorable trip, including the fact the first full day I had the car I drove from 10 am til 2 am to get to St Paul from Bowling Green to make it in time for a family member's wedding. 

If I hadn't found the C8 I wanted already built and in route to a dealership, I would've done a museum delivery on that as well. I definitely encourage anyone with the option to do so to make the trip, and enjoy the drive home.

I would've shared a word of caution to not stay at the hotel on the street leading up to the museum due to the history that place had, but looking at street view it seems that place has been completely torn down without a trace, so no worries there!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I did this when I bought my C8. Absolutely worth the extra charge as it's a really incredible experience. Drove it all the way back to San Diego and don't think i stopped smiling once. Man I miss that car sometimes. 

For what it's worth, if you ever get the chance to visit the Corvette Museum, it's absolutely worth it even if you're not a big 'Vette guy. One of the coolest automotive museums I've been to and you can tell how much care went into crafting the exhibits.

They even claimed the shooter shot kirk with 30-06 but the weapon used was a Mauser. While Mauser can be chambered in 30-06, only later versions. Reports are that the weapon is a pre WWI surplus rifle which would not have been chambered with 30-06.</div>

We could probably still do something like that. While the ceiling of capabilities is rising exponentially the floor isn’t rising as the same rate. They still make simple mistakes they shouldn’t be making which makes them unreliable in a real world setting. </div>

                <div class="post-content">Hey everyone😊
So this is the situation, I’ve been familiar with CrossFit for a long time (since around 2013) but started training at a box only recently (dabbled with calisthenics and others for many reasons) and so I’ve been considering maybe doing a level 1 course, but I have no desire to become a trainer. The main idea is to get a better understanding of the thought behind the WOD’s and just general horizon broadening. Anyone do something similar? Or am I just throwing money away?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is kind of how humans work too. 

IMO this is a big part of what “general intelligence” means—the ability to adapt on the fly the way a human can. When what you’re “trained” on fails, most humans can come up with adaptions and solutions. Humans can solve problems they weren’t explicitly trained to solve. 

If you blew a human’s leg off—assuming they’re not dead or writhing in pain—they would immediately start hopping around on one leg. Even though they’ve lived their entire life with two legs, and they’ve never known anything different, they would use their intelligence to find a solution to this unexpected problem.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Trataka is the name of this practice in Yoga at least. It can be done with anything really but some things tend to be more recommended than others. I like the idea of using yantras as they are cool to look at, though never did this as a practice. I think in Buddhism it is called kasina meditation but I never did that either. Maybe I will take up one of these as it is an interesting way of training.
