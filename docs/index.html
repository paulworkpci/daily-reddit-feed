                                <div class="reply-body">Much less impetus to rush.  I think they were likely crunching to get a release out ahead of the new EU regulations.  Now that they have to comply with them, they will delay both to meet them and to lock in their performance targets strategically.

There's now time to "optimize, quantize, and lobotomize" to hit expense targets.  It gives "free room for improvement" in the future, instead of doing a rush release without time to draw it down and test to make sure it still hits higher on all the desired benchmarks.

They don't need to deliver a grand slam.  "The best and with new features" means they buy themselves another round, so they may as well put actual effort into holding some cards in reserve for later.

Hopefully I'm just being cynical and wrong.  :)</div>

I use it for bay leaves as well, all in one tea ball on a chain, and my chicken noodle soup is one of my most requested. I imagine the same could be done with chunks of cinnamon or chicory.</div>

It lets you remove the herbs when you want and you just toss it all when you're done. </div>

But I hear about things like using Roo Code. Then I see it has a million choices for the LLM it uses. And many new terms like quantization. A bit overwhelming.  
  
And new stuff is being created by the hour. So my question is this, for someone like me, with minimal coding expertise, and I'm cheap, what is the best setup I can run tomorrow to build my next app?

                        <div class="comment-body">Two ways to build app
- ask questions and copy paste from chat (boring, slow, cheap)
- use IDE/plugin/cli tool which read your entire codebase (fast, easy, expensive)

Example : you added a new feature - show top sales of coconut by month - using tools approach it can easily update the code in various location - frontend, middleware, api creation, sql creation.... Using 1 single prompt.

Without tools, you would have to copy paste it 5-7 times and still would make few mistakes.

which is cheapest tool? It's vscode plugin like roo/cline with llm api. IDE like cursor and cli like claude code is expensive

To answer your question,
- create and get a api key of openrouter.ai
- search on site for free models
- use that free model on roo plugin
- practice, practice 
- understand pricing of  each question/prompt you ask

Once you mastered prompting, start using premium tools.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My work flow uses copy paste from chat, and I can't imagine using the IDE tools loose on my code like that. I'm configuring environments to run kafka, spark, airflow and olap db's, and locally hosted llms, and all the work required is 90% discussing about the best way to go about it (centralised logging, auto data reconciliation etc) that I just know would all be undone as soon as I take the breaks off the agentic llm. I use TDD to build each component in turn, then follow up with the integration testing and it's baby steps the entire way to avoid polluting the code with inconsistent code patterns. Any chance it gets, the llm stops using my preferred decorator approach, creates some brand new way of logging and I'd have duplicate and inconsistent ways of doing things all over the shop.

Maybe for simple poc apps, but not on actual multi repo systems.

Would be interested if anyone has an experience that can change my mind. Kilo code looks like a potential option, but the focus is on the coding side, not the architecture and coding patterns side of this. I know there's an architecture agent, but in my experience I'm using o3 for ages before a single line of code is written and when it is, it's precise and one fully tested module at a time. I feel like a system like kilo code needs a fully configured chief architect agent for each line of code written to ensure it is inline with proper thinking, and the chief tester agent to assure the quality and consistency before the coding agent is let loose on introducing a whole new set of problems.</div>

                <div class="post-content">For years, I thought I was “growing” by bingeing spiritual podcasts, YouTube talks, and endless books. But honestly? I was still empty. The more I consumed, the more disconnected I felt—from myself, from others, from any real sense of purpose.

Then I stumbled on a verse from the Bhagavad Gita:  
*“You have the right to perform your prescribed duties, but not to the fruits of your actions.”* (2.47)  
It hit me: I was living on the fruits of others’ work, but not cultivating my own garden.

You can exfiltrate an entire model by just collecting its outputs.

"You would never steal a car" == "You would never copy and mass aggregate the responses of our LLM."

AI model piracy is about to become a big thing. DeepSeek was just the first.

And there's nothing these companies can do to stop it.

I love to see it. This is why the companies just need to adopt open models. They're going to be fighting an unwinnable war to protect their models.</div>

Anthropic has demonstrated through their actions, public statements, and interpretability research that they are serious about safety. It's a self selecting group of people who all think that AI is going to be very impactful and has the chance of going wrong if not done properly. 

Of all the companies working at the frontier they are by far the most responsible and committed to doing it right. That doesn't mean they're perfect but at its core anthropic is a company full of idealistic people who are trying to do the right thing.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Anthropic is still top dog for coding pretty much, even openai was using their models. You can can better results with additional tools on top, like coderabbit, sentry, linear, etc. GPT-5 is coming, but only time will tell how good it actually is for coding, but early returns look promising. A Claude code subscription for $17 is probably the way to go. Note: I have subs for cursor, windsurf, copilot, anthropic, and perplexity, but Opus 4 is still king. There are some cheaper options to fill in the gaps, I've been hearing good things about Kimi and a few others, but I really try and stick to SOTA models, as I get much better results with much less prompting.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I have been using all the new models that came out of China in the last week or two, GLM-4.5 is maybe the top one and its insanely cheap/free. Been experimenting with the new Qwen3 models, coder, 2507, also Kimi K2 is excellent. I always keep tons of tabs of all these open, Openrouter tabs, Gemini 2.5 Pro AI Studio tabs.. Honestly lately they seem equal to Claude 4. Claude 4 would sometimes.. do stuff I never asked it to do and I feel like I need to babysit it more than before.

I mainly use Cline and web chat's (huge amount of tabs open for all the different sites/models), but have Roo Code installed. I use a tool I made to go back and forth to the different web chat interfaces because I really just cannot get any agent tools to be as smart as what you get when you don't give ANY tools, no MCP, no agent stuff etc. So to get max intelligence, i plan things out, bug fix, outside of any agent tool, and then if it/we/me conclude the output is good enough to inact, i tell it "write a prompt for Cline, the AI coding agent, to complete the tasks. Enclose the entire Cline prompt in one big code tag, and include some explanations/whys to what we are doing to help keep Cline on task". Then just paste the output into cline and let it go. --- I haven't tried Claude Code or Open Code.. but thinking about trying it but with the API set to GLM 4.5. They have some guides 

Been having tons of good luck doing it this way... every time I get lazy and let an agent try to do everything it just.. well for easy things, its fine, but for hard problems.. almost never fixes the problem/figures out and i end up wasting more time than if i had just used the web chat. I did make a free tool to help me generate the context to paste to the web chat's (so I don't have to copy and paste - there are like 30+ similar tools to what i made out there for people that don't want a UI on it: [https://wuu73.org/aicp](https://wuu73.org/aicp) )

  
Honestly I think Github Copilot sucks, but they do give you unlimited GPT 4.1... for $10/month, and they allow you to use it in Cline/Roo Code/etc... so what I have been doing is not using the actual copilot (I even turned it off) just using the copilot API... in Cline. But I haven't even used it with all these other cheap and free models out lately. Copilot is always so slow whenever I have tried to use it for something.. its just like wtf.. why is it taking 10 minutes to do one small thing

\--- almost forgot there is Kiro, which has free Claude 4 currently. It is Amazon's clone of VS Code. I haven't ran into any limits with it.. seems to work and its free for now.</div>

Even crazier is RETURNING a refugee in the first place, presumably they were admitted because their life was justifiably in danger by remaining in gaza, but send them back to die for facebook posts lol?</div>

They probably has a bot having 100s of convos for him and trying to arrange dates for him. So my guess is you’ll get a generic GPT response to yoir reply.  

My guess is the photos are probably AI enhanced, as well. 

Honestly this is probably a net good thing for society if this destroys dating apps and people have to meet in person and not treat people like disposable commodities. </div>

# A Message That Actually Shows No Love

Hey there,

So I heard you're getting divorced. Honestly, I'm not surprised - I could see this coming from a mile away. Remember when I told you that person wasn't right for you? But did you listen? Nope.

You've always been stubborn like that. Making the same mistakes over and over. I swear, sometimes I wonder where I went wrong raising you.

Anyway, I suppose you'll be moving back in with me now since you probably can't afford your own place. Just don't expect me to cook for you every night like when you were a kid. You're an adult now, figure it out.

Maybe this will finally teach you to make better decisions. Though knowing you, you'll probably just repeat the same patterns with the next person.

Well, good luck I guess. Try not to mess up whatever comes next.

“Thank you so much for your message—it truly means a lot. In moments of transition, having words of encouragement like yours helps ground me and remind me of the strength that already exists within. This is a challenging chapter, but also a meaningful one—an opportunity for growth, healing, and rediscovery. I’m grateful to have your support on this journey.”</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">But that's her MOTHER. Literally, if you don't know what to say you be vulnerable. You say "hey, I was thinking of you this morning. Been typing and retyping this message because I want to send words of encouragement and let you know I'm here for you but wasn't sure exactly what to say to make you feel better. I wish I had the right words to make your pain go away. I love you" If you don't know what to say then say so. At least it's genuine. 

Except after I wrote that out it felt silly because literally saying "I'm here for you and love you" *isn't* hard to say. It just isn't. A mother should have strong, clear feelings for her child, and years of experience expressing them. Come on now</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt; The 19-year-old Naibel Benavides, who was a college student at the time, died on April 25, 2019, after being struck by a Tesla Model S sedan driven by George Brian McGee. McGee had dropped his phone while approaching a T-intersection with Tesla’s Autopilot software activated. The NYT report states that he drove through the intersection at more than 50 mph, crashing into the legally parked SUV of Benavides and her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, on the other side.

&gt; It was also reported that McGee's foot was on the accelerator pedal as he approached the intersection, thereby overriding a function of Autopilot that is capable of stopping for objects in the road. The lawyer representing Benavides' family said that data and video from the crash showed that the Autopilot system recognized the parked SUV and at least one pedestrian before the collision.

How in the world is tesla even partially responsible here, his foot was on the accelerator. The best L2 systems will override if you have your foot on the accelerator, the car recognized the obstacle. Should we really set precedent that the car should have priority over human inputs? Am I missing something?

The name is misleading, but autopilot in 2019 could not stop at stop signs, lights, etc.. Like, two seconds with the system or two seconds in the manual and you would know this.</div>

You’re in command of the car, you’re still responsible for its movement. Same thing applies to ships and planes, regardless if they’re on autopilot.</div>

&gt;The best L2 systems will override if you have your foot on the accelerator,


This is not entirely true. It would defeat the whole point of the "Automatic Emergency Braking" feature that virtually all cars sold today have. Think of a situation where you are looking at your radio controls, and a child runs out across the street. You'd have your foot against the pedal to maintain speed. If any amount accel pedal was allowed to override, you'd hit the child.


Most OEMs calibrate the system to require a substantial amount of acceleration pedal depressed to override the system. In many cases, as much as 80%.</div>

Its like the country had collective amnesia in 2024 and forgot what his first term was like. A malignant narcissist addicted to social media rage doesn't just *chill out* over time, especially when a date is coming where they will lose power. And this time, they have a plan to get everything done before he flips out. It's all written down, and they are executing it.

It's so frustrating. Like being able to see the future and nobody believes you because the truth is too crazy.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">"Agentic capabilities" are mostly a marketing bullshit thought. You need a very low error rate, long context, tool use, preferably good image recognition(depending on the type of the agent). There are no special capabilities inherent for a model, all of the above is very useful for a model regardless if it is an agent or not. And all the functionality that makes it "agentic" is an external orchestration. Models are not trained to be agents, they are trained on individual tasks that are useful for both agentic and normal workflows. I mean there is some RLHF to make it work better with orchestration engines, but better model overall will be a better "agent" almost always.</div>

Granted this is just my opinion but: companies pay consultants (like McKinsey) a lot of money because they provide a lot of value to the company, mostly in the form of showing them how to cut costs. You call this "enshittification", the company calls it "profit". Let's say those are synonyms, so we don't have any disagreement there.

That won't change with AI slotting in the place of those consultancies. It will just be used for more efficient "enshittification".

You'll go to Chipotle and the AI robot will analyze your mood based on your facial expressions and gait and posture, as well as all the data they bought from other companies, and determine *the bare minimum chicken scoop size* it can give you without making you upset.</div>
