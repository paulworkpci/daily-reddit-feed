This is not me making a statement on whether or not there is a conspiracy, because I have no idea. I'm just curious if people will believe it if the files show there isn't a conspiracy.

Edit: Couple of things. First off, I've used some poor phrasing, what I mean by "just died", is that the official story is true, no conspiracy.

Secondly, people keep bringing up the classified information part, but given the history of the US to just classify pretty much anything, that's not a smoking gun. It's evidence there MAY be stuff that's being hidden that proves a conspiracy, but it's not evidence in itself of a conspiracy. It could also well be that it's stuff like - the FBI were aware Lee Harvey was mental and the CIA were aware someone may try kill the President, but because back then those departments famously didn't talk to eachother, the assassination happened. Ya know, shit that makes the govt look bad, but not that they killed JFK.</div>

I think many of us deeply resent this app and its toxic culture, but we tolerate it because we’re bored and it’s addicting to use. Many of us might also be lonely, and getting to socialize on here helps us a bit with isolation and loneliness. But now let’s dig deeper.

Those false promises being that we will be entertained on Reddit, that we will learn something, and that we will engage in and become part of a community. None of those are true beyond the shallowest sense of interpretations.

I've been there, and read a lot of posts on this sub from others who have as well. Since Reddit is my only social media, I notice a significant contrast in my life during the periods when I quit this site.

Primarily I think the reason I keep coming back is a lack of social contacts and community in my real life. All my friends moved far away so we only see each other a couple times per year. Being offline completely is peaceful, but lonely. I think I keep returning to Reddit because I mentally trick myself into thinking the illusion of community here, is better than no community at all. Which probably isn't even true when weighing out all of the negative effects of this app.</div>

Joe is pure misinformation now and he’s not even hiding it. Fuck man, it really sucks to see this shit as someone who used to listen to every episode a decade ago.</div>

I know the ending hasn't been written yet and no matter which way it goes it's going to be terribly tragic, but somebody has to start working on this.

Musk is the walking embodiment of money doesn't buy happiness.

It really feels if you do some thing X you will be happy, and Musk is out here like doing all this cool stuff but then also very clearly paying people to play video games for him; completely changing X so that his posts get more views than everyone else; and admitting to having sock-puppet accounts to do, among other things, pump his own actions as a dad up.

Its so pathetic and so relatable, and I really hate it.</div>

They jumped the shark with DEI big time.

                                <div class="reply-body">Y’all need to quit spreading that propaganda. They are doing this because the data they collect on the usage of 100+ million people using it for free is infinitely more valuable than the $20 they would collect from &lt;10 million. 

The $20 or even $200 a month subscription is peanuts compared to the money coming in via API use by Big Co. Major companies paying &gt;10k or even &gt;100k a month for OpenAI API is happening.

The reason DeepSeek is offering their services at that cost is because the 100 people that actually pay for it isn’t enough to stress test their infra or pay their bills. So they are losing even more money to try to acquire customers.

The 30 redditors that cancelled their ChatGPT subscription to migrate to DeepSeek because of the inflated and exaggerated, capabilities of the model vs OpenAI isn’t even enough to pay for toilet paper in San Francisco. They will be fine.</div>

If a project has a due date or someone is relying on me to finish something, I’ll buckle down and get it done. But when I’m working on something with no immediate deadline—like a personal project, studying, or organizing my home—I tend to procrastinate like crazy.

For example, I’ve been meaning to declutter my workspace and finally organize my files, but it’s been on my to-do list for months. Every time I thi...</div>

Limit your time. Give yourself x amount of time to do something, hard limit.

Edit: The Idea is not to set an artificial deadline for when you have to be done with a task (unless that works for you). 

The idea is to set a time limit where you get to do a task. If you aren't done in time, try again tomorrow. Might work best with things like reading where it's more about the journey.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The pomodoro technique works really well for me in this regard. That's because the time frame (25 minutes - 5 minute break - repeat) is short enough that even my mammal brain can comprehend it. It sort of enables it to act as a focus exercise as well, since you have to catch yourself if you are getting distracted and be like "you can think of that in 15 more minutes (or whatever is left), back on task for now". You just have to decide how many 'pomodoros' you need to put in each day, and then actually get yourself to sit down and start it. 

For sitting down and starting it I sort of use an induction method where I just make myself sit quietly and breath, clear my thoughts a bit, and then think about the task that needs to be done. It is a lot easier to convince yourself to sit down and think about something than it is to actually do something. But after thinking about it and why it needs to be done it is a lot easier than trying to jump straight into the pomodoros without clearing your focus.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's pretty tough. In school, I found it was pretty effective to break down my daily schedule and carve out time to work on specific projects. Even if the deadline was still months off, setting that time aside motivated me to get it done.

For my personal projects, I also find it *really* helps to have another person involved to motivate you. I try to bring in collaborators on projects or ask a friend to be an accountability buddy. Knowing that *someone else* knows you've been putting it off can give you the same kind of drive that a deadline would.</div>

Any one of these billion-dollar investment companies can be occupying the absolute bleeding edge of this tech. And all it takes is one person on that edge to quietly let it loose to rubberband the whole field back up.

Scientists have more in common with each other, by a *lot,* than they do with billionaires. It seems increasingly like the people in the best position to know *exactly* how big a thing they're working on, are aware of that.</div>

But, in the end, scientists and engineers are still subject to the greatest powers of humanity: politics and economics. It's only a matter of time until these fabulous and disruptive technologies are instrumentalized by powerful actors to suit their own fears and goals.

I don't see many futures where AI doesn't lead to war. The tensions are accumulating, everywhere. We will test the best AI/AGI/ASI model in the post-apocalyptic scenario that comes next - whoever survives the nuclear winter gets to rebuild the world however they want.

All it takes is 1 nuclear leader who's confident enough to take the bet. All of the others (and the whole world) would be dragged along.

How americans chose Trump to be responsible for this single choice is beyond me.</div>

The only reason AI researchers / engineers in the US earn as much as they do rn is because of supply VS demand, not because AI is some field where only geniuses can work.

So all the community can do is speculate and create their own beliefs. I don't think you can solve that unless someone starts releasing the evidence. The community is going to keep doing what they're doing until the truth embargo is lifted.</div>

[Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) responded](https://x.com/senschumer/status/1882555171596804472?s=46&amp;t=M0ofkkf9lgSjlI29wi9d5w) to the news of President Trump’s executive order calling for the declassification of the JFK, RFK, and MLK files.

Schumer simply said “Now do UFOs.”

It’s great to see Schumer still engaging on the topic.

Schumer simply said “Now do UFOs.”

Harry Reid makes the DoD study UFOs -&gt; Lue Elizondo comes out and gets to the frontpage of the New York Times -&gt; Schumer, Reid's friend and successor as majority leader, drafts the UAPDA (which passes the Senate) and might just get the football to the end zone.

This was allegedly used by the Allen Dulles/CIA faction to block JFK's efforts to declassify the UFO file in the 1960s. This "Restricted Data" stamp is allegedly still being used today to keep large tranches of UFO documents secret.</div>
