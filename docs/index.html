Altman said intelligence scales as the logarithm of resources, so even with exponential scaling, intelligence gains are only linear. He also estimated AI is improving by about one standard deviation of IQ per year. But even these linear intelligence gains quickly lead to super-exponential usefulness as new capabilities emerge. And the cost for last year’s intelligence does go down 10x per year. See [his blog post](https://blog.samaltman.com/three-observations) where he explains these three observations.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">my 2 cents (as you remind me of me): you're too strict with yourself, and this is draining your motivation. when you do something, you force yourself to do it excellently to the extent it can become joyless and punitive, 'pushing through' even when it is hurting you (like in your gym example). in these conditions, why on earth would you want to do anything?! it's natural to want a break from your inner dictator. your subconscious is rebelling because it wants a break - understandably!

i'd try to make the tasks you procrastinate on feel easier and less pressurised - eg, break them down into small pieces, reward yourself, and LET YOURSELF REST. take breaks and be strict about that - you're not allowed to not take breaks. listen to your body - if you're pushing through when you're exhausted, then stop. you got this!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agree to this. Try to do time blocking in your calendar, set an hour or 1 and half to do a particular task or progress a task forward. Don't forget to insert a break in between before moving on with another task. Otherwise, you will burn yourself out and fry your brain. 

And if you do end up getting diagnosed, they do not outright prescribe medication for ADHD - I know this because I am diagnosed with it. It just comes down to how you manage it. You just need an outlet for that pent up stress, and it sounds to me like the gym has become more like a chore, instead of something you enjoy doing. 

Maybe try another form of exercise that changes your scenery, like cycling or hiking?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If you have always been this way my bet would be adhd.

Many people with adhd are good workers but not good at stuff they find boring. Adhd people are even supermen in some areas (for example, working 3 jobs at the same time and still having a social life- i could never).


Possibly you are depressed if its a new thing.


But perhaps look up some tricks for adhd, see if that helps you? If its seriously bad perhaps see a psychiatrist and get a diagnosis and some sweet medication</div>

So Ross says that he has been talking to legacy program defectors and they say that the reverse engineered UAP technology is mind bogling and can end the era of fossile fuel, end wars, unify humanity and open doors for consciousness understanding. This is joigning what Greer is saying, and what Ben Rich pointed to but he said that getting those techs out would require an act of god. Eric Davis said that there is no ARVs but there is some advances in programmable quantum materials. The Ecosystemic Podcast with an official from DOE seemed to point to the same direction of getting those technologies out to the public domain.

I kid and I love Ross, but I also get the people that point out that if this technology has the possibility to save humanity from war and poverty, I don't see these personalities that are being told about all these secrets really considering the gravity of it all.</div>

The last CME I did was called “The Psychedelic Medicine review” and it was all about legitimate medical research and treatments for various medical problems. 

They had a whole section on Psilocybin and they had some promising data and legit research to quote about its effectiveness and efficacy rates coupled with practical and safe ways of administration. 

They did speak very briefly about micro dosing and while they spoke very highly of using psilocybin in controlled environments and correct conditions, they did say that micro dosing wasn’t a promising treatment and with the data they had, would not suggest it for treatment, especially for those that are using it without proper medical oversight. 

I don’t want to rain on your parade and tell you that it’s bad, but the data didn’t look very promising. They said that psilocybin was an excellent method when combined with proper therapy and consultation while using it. The whole point of using it was that it opens you up to be willing to accept new perspectives that a patient may not be open to hearing under normal circumstances. 

I’m certainly not a psychologist and don’t take my word for it but I think it’s worth doing more research into the subject to ensure that you’re not doing damage or harming yourself using a method that isn’t as proven and doesn’t has robust data to boot. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve grown mushrooms and have tripped my share of balls, but also, these doctors were incredibly insightful. They are on the forefront of this research and are also kinda outcasts compared to their counterparts and colleagues so I’d definitely consider what they have to say about the positive/negative effects of micro dosing and also, heed caution. 

They also had sections on Ketamine, which isn’t technically a psychedelic unless you take a very very large amount, which then acts similar to a psychedelic. 

They also spoke about LSD and ayahuasca treatments for major depression disorders and other addictions like alcohol, cocaine and other addictive abuse disorders. Super informative to say the least. 

Also funny to note; I was getting major loud whiffs of weed and I was worried I forgot to take something out of my bag. No. It was one of the doctors that was presenting. She stunk like the best flower this side of the Mississippi lol.

 *“And then, with almost an element of fierceness — if a person that gentle, that dignified, can be said to have such a quality — she said…*

The real goldmine is the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Building, where Not just the US but also a bunch of other nations keep their gold.

There have been all sorts of conspiracy theories about that in the past, not helped by the fact that representatives of foreign countries trying to audit for publicity stunts weren't quite granted the level of access one might need to check that the gold really was still there.

Also one of those Die Hard movies featured the vault as a target of criminals.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Correct... and also the level of tooling a fab can support in each iteration.

From a historical perspective, James Watt was certainly capable of understanding how a nuclear boiler works if someone explained the concept of critical mass and control systems (the graphite rods). For that matter, a relatively bright engineer from Roman times could probably figure it out if they saw the machine in action.

The tooling and tolerances to build the machine were centuries - millennia away. For that matter, the discipline of unit testing &amp; quality control was also essential.</div>

A) Impose tarifs on almost all other countries, even as high as 25%
B) Deport illegal immigrants to camps in guantanamo.
C) Cut A LOT of federal programs spendings.
D) cut all DEI programs. go only by merit.
E) Attempt to take control of Panama Canal.
F) Back off the WHO and Paris climat accord.

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;The Information is a well-regarded technology and business news publication founded in 2013 by Jessica Lessin, a former Wall Street Journal reporter. It is known for its in-depth, high-quality journalism, focusing on the tech industry, startups, venture capital, and broader business trends. The publication operates on a subscription model, which is somewhat unique in an era of ad-supported media, and it emphasizes exclusive, insider reporting rather than chasing breaking news.

&gt;Strengths:

&gt;Deep, Investigative Reporting: The Information is known for its detailed and well-researched articles, often providing insights into the inner workings of tech companies, leadership dynamics, and industry shifts.

&gt;Focus on Exclusivity: It frequently breaks stories or provides scoops that aren't widely covered by other outlets, making it valuable for industry insiders, investors, and professionals.

&gt;High-Quality Audience: Its readership includes tech executives, investors, and decision-makers, which makes it a go-to source for those in the tech and business ecosystem.

&gt;No Ads, Subscription-Driven: By relying on subscriptions rather than ads, The Information avoids some of the clickbait tendencies of other media outlets, allowing it to focus on quality over quantity.

&gt;Events and Community: It hosts exclusive events and has a community platform, which adds value for subscribers and fosters networking among industry professionals.

&gt;Criticisms:

&gt;Paywall Limitations: The subscription cost (around $400 annually or $40 monthly, as of recent pricing) can be prohibitive for casual readers or those outside the tech industry, limiting its accessibility.

&gt;Niche Focus: Its heavy focus on tech and business might not appeal to a broader audience looking for general news or diverse topics.

&gt;Competition: It faces competition from other tech-focused outlets like TechCrunch, Bloomberg, Axios, and Reuters, as well as newer platforms like Substack, where individual journalists sometimes offer similar insights at a lower cost or for free.

&gt;Perception of Elitism: Some critics argue that its high subscription price and focus on insiders can create an elitist perception, catering primarily to those already in positions of power or wealth.

&gt;My Opinion:

&gt;The Information is an excellent resource for professionals, investors, and anyone deeply interested in the tech industry. Its commitment to quality journalism and independence from ad revenue is commendable, and it fills a gap in the market for detailed, insider reporting. However, its high cost and niche focus make it less accessible to the average reader, which could limit its broader impact. If you're in the tech or business world and can justify the subscription cost, it's likely worth it for the insights and networking opportunities. For casual readers, though, there are more affordable or free alternatives that might suffice.

&gt;If you have a specific aspect of The Information you'd like to dive deeper into (e.g., its coverage, business model, or impact), let me know! 😊

                                <div class="reply-body">This actually existed once before the Internet became mainstream. It just wasn't called “social media” yet. It was a place by enthusiasts for enthusiasts (IRC, forums etc.). Then the complexity was simplified so that any fool anywhere could participate in order to increase profits. 

It was therefore rather rare for different social and intellectual groups to clash. In the beginning, it was very homogeneous, also in terms of political views, which at the time were more in the background, behind the technical opportunities.

A few years ago (I was 17, now I'm 20), I got into this really personal argument with someone else on here. It was deeply personal, and ended up affecting me deeply. Like, way more than what is normal. I admittedly was not a good debater at all back then, and I feel like I couldn't defend myself in a good way, and I ended up letting them walk all over me. 

I don't really want to go into more details about what specifically I was arguing about...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">YMMV but (I’m just some lady, and I know this is gonna sound so goddamn woo-woo cringe but bear with me) you probably gotta forgive your past self. And you gotta apologize to your past self and reassure them that you’re gonna do better at standing up for them. 

Like REALLY forgive yourself. Look at who you were and what you had going on and forgive yourself for not being good at debating.

Seriously reassure yourself that you’re better at defending the things you care about now. Remind yourself that even if you hopelessly lost an argument about something that was important to you, that doesn’t mean you don’t care about that subject or that irreparable harm has been done to something you care about. Somebody was a huge dick to you, and that sucks! But it’s something that can be overcome.

Sit with those nervous heated feelings and just let them happen, and let them pass. No shame, no “ugh why am I feeling this bad about something that happened so long ago?!” judgment thoughts. Just let your body feel the feelings until it’s done with them. They can’t hurt you even if it feels like they could eat you alive.

After you’ve done even one of these things, I think you’ll find yourself feeling quite a lot better. And if you do all of them, I can *just about* promise you you’re not gonna be preoccupied by this anymore.</div>

Or food (~$500/mo) works out to $16/day so if I go and buy a fast food meal for $15, that's my entire days food budget, that I already spent at the store.

If I look at something like entertainment, it better be far, far less than all that.


I do agree however that looking at finances from more than a single point of view is definitely a good thing.</div>

Would go against the propaganda of being the most awesome thing since sliced bread.

Then again, it might be that other nations are more willing to admit powers beyond our own exist. Who knows.</div>

It’s funny cuz in a sense it’s as simple as just doing anything else… yet it’s so hard and complicated. You can try reducing bit by bit or you can go more hardcore and just commit to hell week as your brain resets.

But it will reset and you can change your habits! It’s just hard to do… and the powers that be just continue to make more $$ for our attention. It’s built to be addictive and it works.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Stopping social media addiction is a multi faceted effort. The biggest thing is always trying to keep a reason behind everything you do. if you can ask yourself "why?" before each thing you do and answer it honestly, i think it'll be a good first step. But a big problem is that tech is so addictive. I'm working on a project that's intended to keep everything good about Social platforms while getting rid of addictive aspects. If you're interested I can send a dm, good luck!</div>
