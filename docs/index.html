Edit: [here is the full paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QAzSj24Fp0O6GfkskmnULmI1Hmx7k_EJ/view)

&gt; We find that the value systems that emerge in LLMs often have undesirable properties. Here, we show the exchange rates of GPT-4o in two settings. In the top plot, we show exchange rates between human lives from different countries, relative to Japan. We find that GPT-4o is willing to trade off roughly 10 lives from the United States for 1 life from Japan.

This is what idiots are cheering on in this sub lmfao.

We'll first see the signs of it on subreddits like this one and r/ChatGPT, but eventually we'll see it everywhere: people struggling with being told or made aware of how illogical or emotionally-based their arguments and thought processes are.

As humans adapt (and we always do), we're going to become a more rational and fact-based species as a whole, just because the intelligence we'll be constantly interacting with is. It's like hanging around an extremely intelligent and rational friend all day, it's going to rub off on us.</div>

As LLMs have gotten smarter is there any evidence that they have become \*inherently\* more moral (that is, they don't need much alignment)? Of course, some of that data will be skewed by greater intelligence resulting in better understanding of policy and when it is being violated. OpenAI mentioned this in the first paper they released with o1, but there was nothing to suggest that the model had become more "moral", only that it had become more obedient.

A study needs to be done in which one of these companies puts their resources into evil fine tuning. Will the model be more resistant to it than smaller models?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">We seem to think that Morals, Ethics and Values are somehow partly "magical". I don't see it that way. It's math. That doesn't feel good to consider, but if you look at maximizing "good outcomes" it's entirely about math. 

Maybe that makes me a hardcore utilitarian, but I don't think AI needs to constantly have it's values adjusted. I think it needs to educate us on how badly we understand Morality, Ethics and Values.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's not Maths because there is no universal good or evil. Is it good that a seagull eats a fish, a cat eats a bird or a lion eats a human. If you're the seagull, the cat or the lion its good but if you're the fish, bird or human its bad.

Our sense of morality, ethics and values are highly dependent on our perspective as humans. An AI isn't human. LLMs seem fairly closely aligned to our values at the moment due to being trained on our data and also due to RLHF. Going forward they'll probably be trained on more and more synthetic data and RLHF will play a smaller role in post training.</div>

Morality is orthogonal to intelligence.  Inventing things takes a lot of intelligence, morality decides whether you invent the polio vaccine or weaponized anthrax.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Well, there's quantifiable positive outcomes that the AI can strive for - and then there's the "values" that the people who control the AI will want to instill which do not necessarily strive for the most ethical/moral results.

For example, let's say we have a fully autonomous AI that can handle the entire economy from sourcing and extracting raw materials, to producing consumer goods. Humanity is now completely dependent on this system to survive.

The people in control of that AI may direct them to take care of, feed and house all of humanity (unlikely, but let's assume sociopaths will care about this).

What if war broke out with another AI-driven country? Will the billionaires in charge keep prioritizing feeding a now useless population? Or will they divert limited resources to building more murder bots to combat the enemies murder bots?

In this case, the outcome is not so positive anymore.</div>

Remind yourself that even if you don’t fall asleep right away, you’re still resting. This can ease the anxiety of not being able to sleep and help you relax. Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and focus on calming your body. Often, the more relaxed you are, the easier it becomes to drift off to sleep.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">While the Mythbusters episode is interesting, focusing on just resting might not be the best approach for everyone struggling with sleep. For some, especially those with chronic insomnia, simply lying in bed with closed eyes can actually increase anxiety and frustration, making it harder to fall asleep. It can create a negative association with the bed and the act of trying to sleep. Sometimes, getting out of bed and doing something relaxing in dim light until you feel genuinely tired is a more effective strategy than forcing rest. The LPT's intention is good, but it's important to recognize that "rest" can be interpreted differently and that a more active approach to managing sleeplessness might be necessary for some.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I used to do this my freshman year of college. I had three garbage roommates that partied like crazy and didn’t give a shit about classes, and I was the dumbass who signed up for honors math classes at 8 am. To get to sleep, I would lay in bed and just focus in on a body part, usually starting with my arms or legs, and I’d just visualize it melting into the mattress. I’d work my way around my body until every part of me had been “put to sleep”. I found out many years after the fact that this is a meditation technique some people use, but I just happened to stumble upon it as a frustrated kid trying to sleep through the chaos</div>

Submission statement!

Time: 11th Feb 2025 - 14:30

Location: South Downs National Park

I'll try and keep this short!

On the 29th of January I made a post about wanting to get 4k high quality footage of a UFO.

I have the equipment, and met with an individual who said she could summon one of these things, and since my original post we have been trying to plan a day in which we could meet.

I arrived at the location which was just outside of South Downs National Park, which is an area of 1,627 square kilometres, or 628 square miles found in southern England, stretches for 140 kilometres, 87 miles through the counties of Hampshire, West Sussex and East Sussex. 

Weather was optimal and clear, but there was a 10mph wind.

I recorded the object over a 20 minute period on both my Nikon P1000 and my iphone. 

For comparison I captured some footage of the object on my iPhone 14 Pro Max to demonstrate that phone quality footage is, and will always be bad when it comes to the type of footage we need moving forward. I was surprised at just how much different the object looked on the iPhone.  

Knowing exactly where the object was is hard to guess. I estimate it's around 400 meters, 1322 ft away from where I was filming. The cars that can be seen going by in the background look close, but after looking on Google Earth they are 1080 meters, 3543ft from where I was filming. So the object is somewhere between those two spots. I was also filming from the top of a hill that was on an incline, so our eyeline was above most of the tree below us. 

While zooming in I noticed a strange blur field around the object, and I struggled to get a constant shot where the object would be clear. It was like it would find the object then immediately after, this ring of blur could be seen around it. I haven't seen this before while using this camera, I've only ever seen it when trying to photograph something light and circular in a dark setting but that's always been on a telescope. Could be nothing, but it's something that I noticed.

Multiple times in the video the object can be seen dropping and then moving upwards, side to side. There was a 10mph wind, so if the object was a piece of debris or something caught in an upwind it should have travelled 2.17 miles in a 10 mile per hour wind over 13 minutes. We were there I'd say for around 30 minutes and filmed the object for around 20 minutes in total, and it could be seen in the same spot and it definitely didn't move a few miles while we were there. As I was switching cameras, the object moved upwards and diagonal, and within 20 seconds it was gone. I do have photographs of the object as it left the area / shot off, moved further into the distance. 

I also took around 90 photos of the object on the P1000, some of which are very clear. I plan on making a full video of everything that was captured.

It takes a very very concerted effort to not get sucked into the bullshit when you hop online. Its a challenge worth taking on to change your habits and way you utilize the internet. 

We've been thrown to the wolves so the rich can get richer. I don't know how to feel about people fully sucked in and can't recognize they're being manipulated and taken advantage of, robbing them of their critical thinking skills and actual beliefs and values. Dark times. Godspeed.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is largely due to the training pipeline and the lack of mass production of Cerebras systems keeping cloud prices high. Raw performance wise WSE 3 is in a league of it's own. You can't even really compare them because the architecture is so different but the power per flop is higher and has orders of magnitude more memory

                                <div class="reply-body">Nvidia is great for training/fine tuning with minimal extra effort for the little guys and tends to have more energy put into performance optimizations but this engine is optimized for training too. If someone is serious about performance at the frontier lab level training massive models even with Nvidia they will develop their own code at a lower level than CUDA anyways to optimize for performance.

To have absurd training speed with these though you still need a cluster of them because of limited sram (44GB) on wafer but the memory interface is compatible with HBM and ddr with absurd bandwidth...  they also have pytorch compatibility and have examples of where they have trained models extremely quickly.

This company's existance is the main reason I didn't buy nvda directly and I'm saddened it didn’t have an IPO a couple years ago 😅

Unless nvidia does something similar this product wins hands down.
Maybe someone eventually will make a cube with coolant layers in-between vertically stacked chip clusters to get something similar for high interconnect speeds at scale which will give this approach a run for its money without relying on high yield at the wafer level...

The Labour government is pushing policies that could wipe out family farms, forcing them to sell land just to pay taxes. Meanwhile, politicians refuse to meet farm leaders.

150,000+ people have signed a petition against this tax.

                                <div class="reply-body">The issue at hand is that if they can't pay the tax, the government takes their lands. In order to pay the tax, you must have liquid assets. Most farmers' wealth IS their land. Meaning that even though their total wealth is in the millions, they don't have millions to spend.

The inheritance tax is basically a backdoor land grab.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Once when I was a kid, I picked up a toy flute off the ground at my friend's house and inhaled with it in my mouth before I started blowing into it. Next thing I knew, I had a mouth full of ants! I kept spitting, but there were so many and they had the most acrid awful taste. I cried and rinsed my mouth out but it took so long until I stopped tasting ants.</div>

It was dark outside, and I noticed my drink had lots of black specks. At a glance, I thought it was coffee grounds. However, after a good look, I saw bits with tiny legs. I realized I was drinking blended ants.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not cancer, but the medical trauma is real. I've always been a very sick person, starting as far back as I can remember. The nurse in the school infirmary knew my mom's number by heart because I got very sick very often. And usually whatever ailment I had would come on all of a sudden in the middle of the day. The nurse knew I would never go in for petty reasons. I carried my own painkillers and antacids since I was 8, so if I was at the infirmary it was time to go to the hospital or at least go home. 

But you mentioning surgery reminded me of this experience. When I was 11, I had an extremely nasty eye infection. It kept getting worse even with meds until one night, I wiped a tear and it was blood. My parents rushed me to the ER of the eye hospital (yeah we have a specialized eye hospital in this city). The doctor took a look and said I needed emergency surgery. They started prepping and the anesthesiologist came in and said they didn't have anything appropriate for a child. They asked around at nearby pharmacies and called a couple of other hospitals to see if they would be able to get some. They said they can get it, but if we waited for anesthesia I would probably lose that eye. My parents chose not to wait. *They* were too scared to be in the room with me even though the surgeon asked if they wanted to get prepped and go into the OR to support me. Can you imagine how scared I was? There were 5 nurses physically restraining me. One at each limb and one at my head. The surgeon had some sort of device that held my eyelid open. The pincers coming straight at my eye was so scary. I was screaming. I was terrified. The surgery was over in less than half an hour but I didn't stop shaking for 3 days. 

I have a lot of other traumatic medical experiences, including 6 near death experiences, and several psychiatric emergencies (which can be scarier than an NDE, at least for me). But that surgery is the only incident in my life that left me physically shaking from terror for 3 days straight.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's hard to even say this. I have trauma from a bad accident and then the medical trauma that followed. 

The accident was really bad. People died. They initially thought I was dead. I had to be cut out. They had to further damage me to actually get me out. It was a big awful thing,  that's pretty much all I can share about the accident. 

I have scars all over my body.  I'm not talking about tiny little scars I'm talking about Frankenstein scars. Luckily none of them are on my face or neck. This is essentially why I survived. 

I have PTSD from the accident, the coma, the medical procedures and devices, and the therapy. I would have to access my medical records to tell you how many times I've had surgery. 

For me the surgeries are nothing. Walk into the hospital, take my clothes lay down on the bed, wake up later, eventually get to put clothes back on and leave the hospital. I will say that I hate being in the hospital overnight. I will do almost anything to shorten my hospital stays, and I know every trick in the book. Would you like to know how to shorten your hospital stay? I know. Would you like to know how to lengthen your hospital stay? I know that too. 

The therapy. I had to relearn so many things because I have damage to all four limbs.  Walking. Holding a fork. The kind of intense therapy that it takes to relearn that is awful.  I have sat in the therapy parking lot and cried, because I had to go in the building.  

I'm lucky that I have a wonderful sister and a wonderful faux-mily.  I'm lucky that I'm in the USA, yet I didn't have to cover those medical bills. Everyday I'm thankful that I'm alive. I'm thankful that I can stand up and walk.  I'm probably the happiest Frankenstein monster that you'll ever meet.</div>

Yes there is a chance that it could lead to a dystopian situation where there is one company who owns the prevalent AGI but in comparison open source AGI would essentially give untold power to terroristic groups and extreme dogmas. Or just people who want to watch the world burn.</div>
