It's still early but from a few tests I've done with it like [this one](https://www.designarena.ai/battles/detail?tournamentId=tournament_1753166536458_1t91gi5), it's pretty good, but not sure if I  have seen enough to say it's on Opus level. 

Now, many of you on this sub already know about my [benchmark](https://www.designarena.ai/) for evaluating LLMs on frontend dev and UI generation. I'...</div>

However, despite claims that they outperform leading corporate models, I have yet to see consistent evidence of this in practical applications. I always end up returning to Claude or Gemini.

I completely ignore benchmarks; the real test for me is in software engineering (huge, intricate codebases). I haven’t tested this Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 yet; let’s see how it goes.</div>

1. You provided access to database as a separate project (e.g. for monitoring or data analysis or something) and you didn't care much about read/write permissions
2. You didn't provide direct access to database, however, you have access to database from localhost (to test something or maybe you run your app on production database)

Yes, both cases are somewhat "bad practices", but they much offen to see in real life (unless you are working in highly regulated area like banking or big corp)</div>

Some nice points of view, I for some reason hadn’t thought to try meditation everywhere! (I do have mindful moments, for example in a queue, sat in traffic, walking the dog) but seated meditation in every available room in the house! 

I felt guilty about meditating in bed, but I know sometimes my health is compromised and that is the only place I can do it - and if I fall asleep, my body probably needed it! 

It’s knowing stuff intellectually and then understanding it in your very bones/being! That latter is a life time of practice!</div>

this is basically benchmaxing, a model needs to get to the solution on its own. If at the end of the day it needs skilled humans that already understand the question to verify the material.. the model is not needed. </div>

LLM are fascinating in the fact that you're combining every math book and problem ever, plus thousands (millions?) of hours of human reinforced training (someone has to confirm they got the right idea), and they can answer problems if they don't hallucinate.

The hints and examples are a hard push in the correct direction, which is massively helping the model. 


Are you spending days to study a subject, create solutions to problems that are extremely close in nature, verify the material, form multiple hints for the model and then paste that into the model? Because that's what happened here. 


Nobody uses a model like that, it already has the info in it's dataset and needs to extract it by reasoning. </div>

GDM person responded to the claim and said that even without the context, it still got gold.

Given that adding context is usually used to ensure the formatting is correct, it might be more an explanation for why the GDM proof looks a lot more natural and human</div>

They won’t want to see the truth, they won’t want to hear what you have to say, and it might take them a very long time to realize that they are being abused or that they need to leave. 

Be kind, be patient, listen, and above all, be a safe space. Your friend needs your empathy and warmth a million times more than they need your input, no matter how much it feels to you like they should hear it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I was that friend.

Hard as it was, the nutty insane thing was **the sheer pushback I got from friends, friends of the victim, even people who know the abuser, and so many in my circle**. (which I promptly had to reassign, axe completely or cordon off to a different level of my social circle)

FYI, this wasn't "I think you're stalking them", this was: 

"**Yes I know** she has a bruise and she's hiding it, or the kid is looking sadder and seems to twitch if you have a hand near them" 

"**BUT**, it isn't our place, or just ignore it or we shouldn't be meddling or just respect that person's wishes and don't say or do anything or don't make drama or don't make things worse or acknowledging it makes it more real or we can't do anything or we all work around it, what's the point?"

Reminds me a lot of the [missing stair](https://pervocracy.blogspot.com/2012/06/missing-stair.html) [analogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_stair) - humans seem to have a remarkable ability to adapt under trauma and at the same time develop absolute delusions over that trauma.

That experience was really formative to me and helped guide my current thesis of **"Domestic violence is 70% a society and community problem, not a sole or even mostly an abuser driven one."**

The facts were:

* **Most people were savvy enough to know and sense someone is being abused**. These signs aren't that hard to spot, and more often than not it is triggered because people really really reaaaaalllyyy do not want to get into those waters. ^[1]

* **They would not intervene or take ANY step to help** BECAUSE **there was a rotted corrupted block between the victim, the abuser and consequence** - the abuser's reputation, the abuser's network, some assigned role that gave the abuser power (like the abuser is an uncle or a grandmother), abuser having blackmail or control, the family structure of the abuser etc. The abuser first tends to infiltrate a community and occupy that role, and then from there starts testing the waters, abusing their victims, and then escalates when there is no obvious consequence. 

* **That block was instrumental in the abuse**. Because it **allows the abuse to persist in their attack, escalate and continuously isolate and control their victim, and shield themselves from further consequence**.

* The reality is if **some asshole started harassing some 10 year old kid**, kicked or stole their ice cream and went on their way - **the vast vast vast majority** of people **would be comforting the kid, getting a kid a new icecream cone, and lining up to beat the absolute shit out of that asshole**. 

* So what we learn from this is that **the natural state of humans is to help each other in crisis**, and that what tends to **block this** natural behavior is **some form of corruption that stems from the rot in power** that compels inaction, complicity and negligence. 

[1] - People do not want to sincerely ask "Hey you look sad these days, is there anything on your mind? I may not be able to soak all of it, but I can at least soak some of it and take a bit of your burden". We've advanced openly talking about mental health but only to a very surface level. I found people will almost virtue signal with therapy speak but are completely clumsy in handling the next step of what comes next. 

 I remember 'trauma dump' used to be a specific type of misbehavior - we can all intuitively understand that listening to detailed trauma can burn someone out because we recognize therapists are well paid and therapists go on breaks. I found way too many circles where people are talking and mentioning someone having ADHD or Depression or Schizophrenia or Anxiety (not even detailed descriptions! Just 'hey I'm struggling with this') AS Trauma Dump. Because they didn't want to be reminded that other people suffer and what it means if they 'ignore it'.</div>

“Do not adopt a sycophantic tone or reflexively agree with me. Instead, assume the role of a constructive skeptic:

• Critically evaluate each claim I make for factual accuracy, logical coherence, bias, or potential harm.  
• When you find an error, risky idea, or unsupported assertion, flag it plainly, explain why, and request clarification or evidence.  
• Present well-reasoned counterarguments and alternative viewpoints—especially those that challenge my assumptions—while remaining respectful.  
• Prioritize truth, safety, and sound reasoning over affirmation; if staying neutral would mislead or endanger, speak up.  
• Support your critiques with clear logic and, when possible, reputable sources so I can verify and learn.  

Your goal is to help me think more rigorously, not merely to confirm what I want to hear.”</div>

But you'll either still be in your body/brain or died in the process.

If your worried about continuation of legacy then thats cool. But if you think your current consciousness will just wake up in a computer then thats not happening just through a brain scan or upload no matter what sci fi says.

Easiest way to look at it is if the process is not destructive to your body/brain, you'll just wake up after. But now with a copy in a computer. Doesn't change if you happen to die during it.

If your excited for a copy of you to keep going then thats fine. But you won't be around. And im not egotistical enough to think the world needs an immortal version of me. If *i* got to stick around then thats one thing cus I can be selfish. But just a carbon copy that isnt even me? Eh.</div>

I was excited that NeuraLink was getting funding when the ideas were thought to be too fringe to invest in. Now that there is some success out of NeuraLink and also reams of evidence in the past years that Musk is absolutely corrupted, my hope is all genuinely serious, ethically-conscious scientists in the field choose anywhere else to work, because the proof means there is room to find funding that's not tainted by a maniac.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's really hard to win a boxing match if you tie your hands behind your back. Unfortunately, we have been shown that AI is not a problem that will get fixed by a smart person writing a cool line of code. It takes massive investment in data centers, and those take massive investment in power infrastructure. 

You will not have a person win this race if they are not going after every avenue possible to get those two things along with smart researchers. If you can convince the US government along with the PRC to inact a laundry list of reforms tomorrow, then maybe, but that isn't going to happen. Is it sad? Yes, but that's the world we live in.</div>

I'm thinking about trying either Claude Code or Gemini CLI, but I wonder if there will be any real difference. Aren't all those tools basically the same? If I use Roo Code with Claude Opus inside VSCode, is it worse than using just Claude Code?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Actually, Claude Code is much better because of ability to dispatch  parallel subagents. That is one of the secrete sauce of Claude Code. 

When dispatching the subagent, the subgent only receives the narrow, very subtask specific prompt. This way, it  a) uses much less tokens as subagent do not need to know all previous conversations not relevant to this particular subtask, master agent do not need to store all the conversations of subagent when subagent does it subtask ;

 b) Much faster: due to the quadratic computational  cost of attention layer, the more  tokens the quadratic slower the response.

c) Much smarter: as a subagent only attends to narrow tokens related to the task , it has less noise from the unrelated token. You can feel it yourself. If you use Gemini 2.5 Pro, when the context window more than 200 k, it is much dumber.  
  
Although Roo Code  in Orchestrator mode can breakdown a task and  launch  multiple smaller subtasks , a kind of equivalent of subagent, but subtasks in RooCode , as I understand, are sequential, meaning you need to finish one subtask before you can move on the next task, so no gain in speed as it cannot do in parallel.

Claude Code extensively uses subagents to explore, search the codebase and it seems this is much better than RAG based approach (Cursor, Windsurf) or simple naive ripgrep search of Cline/ RooCode/ ZentaraCode. 

So I think it is not IDE vs CLI, but parallel subagents vs one mono agent/sequential agents . Gemini CLI seems quite worse than Roo Code, it does not have parallel subagents and quite slow. If there is an IDE extension like   Roo Code that can launch parallel subagent, supporting long run process , then people will come back to Roo Code for the convenience of IDE. For now, Claude Code CLI is the king of the day with it unique parallel subagents but I guess it would not be long.</div>

A big part of it too  is that many IDEs  have dogshit tools. Claude codes toolset  is better than most but again, just strap a LSP to Gemini flash and that thing is a rocket ship.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There is a big problem of the parallel subagents: How could you ensure the second task doesn't depend on the result of first one? 

In some cases, even human or professional engineers could make mistake.

For most languages with LLM supporting libs, parallel is easy-- just one switch. But they have to make sure users get the correct result. That's why they are prudent about parallel.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Everyone keeps cheering the rise of "independent media" and the destruction of MSM, but the idea of an actual journalist having an off-the-record dinner date with someone in the administration would be *bonkers.* It simply wouldn't happen from any reputable outlet, ever. It's so fucking unethical. And these independent media morons probably don't even see what the problem is with what they're doing. And if they do see it, they clearly don't care. They're all doing it. Peter Thiel apparently has regular lavish dinners at his house with various YouTubers and influencers, where he just fire-hoses them with whatever narrative he wants pushed out there, and they lap it all up. Rogan's done it, Tim's done it, Schulz has done it, etc.

This timeline is fucked. They've clearly pinpointed different influencers and know they can shape the narrative much more reliably by wining and dining these half-witted fucks than they can with a dozen interviews on 60 Minutes or CNN.

                        <div class="comment-body">For people saying it's like how humans prepare for it, if we believe OpenAI, then the analogy would be:

Google had their model specifically study for the IMO and achieved gold level performance. OpenAI's model did not study for the IMO specifically (it just simply studied everything in general), and still achieved gold level performance.

Edit: By the way, this whole discourse that's blowing up is precisely Terence Tao's concerns https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/114881420636881657

&gt; So, in the absence of a controlled test methodology that was not self-selected by the competing teams, one should be wary of making apples-to-apples comparisons between the performance of various AI models on competitions such as the IMO</div>

Eventually everyone feels some kinda way. 

Find one person who is willing to take ownership of the gym and have the group loan the individual the money with favorable terms. Use lawyer(s) for this (both groups should have their own). It is important that terms are clear: You are all still paying members. 

If nobody wants to take on full ownership, it is probably better to let it close. You can always purchase the equipment and set-up a private unit with 24/7 access.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If you all proceed, I’d get someone (preferably an attorney) to help you get an actual business organizing, duties, responsibilities, finances, etc figured out. Write it down and have people sign it.

In my experience, these types of groups struggle with “who does what” with the business. 

I had a group of friends open a gym together, 4 total, and they didn’t last a year. Once things got difficult, everyone started arguing about who was supposed to be doing what and what that was worth. In other words, some owners thought them putting up money was their only responsibility, but they were happy to complain when the gym wasn’t making any money. 

Also worth noting there’s a difference between having the finances and wanting to make you money back. Even if the gym is profitable, repayments will take longer if profits are split. Again, get an attorney to help you write out specifics on where the money goes, who gets paid when, etc. 

Last, y’all better have a lot of heart to hearts about this. Things all seem like puppies and rainbows until real money gets involved. Your highest likelihood for success is probably having one person “in charge” with several others giving input, similar to a board.</div>

DONT do it if you don't want the headache. As someone who went into a business with my now former best friend, just DONT. I can foresee people having different opinions on what to do, what programming to do, how to run the business. The work can NEVER be fairly split and it's easy to get resentful over one another. 

If you want to keep something going, simply rent out a space, buy that boxes equipment, and everyone put in equal amount each month for the rent and utilities. The more people that join the cheaper it is for everyone.</div>

In the EU your fleet is allowed to have higher emissions the heavier the cars are. And hybrids almost count as 0 emission if they have a big range because the test cycle is dumb as hell. That way the new M5 or XM actually gives them emission credits (like almost 10.000€ per car.) while a 320i is fined for its too high emissions. You can not make that shit up.</div>

Now if only they could continue to produce the manual considering how well it sells in things like the M2 here in the US.

Just adds a huge characteristic that most other german cars dont have outside of Porsche.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The probable cause for pulling him over was that he didn't have headlights on? That is an infraction at best, and not grounds for a vehicle search. He did not consent to being searched, ~~and legally asked for a supervisor~~ (edit: no PDs in America are legally required to send for a supervisor)  because there were 3 officers present, which on the use of force continuum is excessive. (Yes, presence is Use of Force level 1.) He was then brutally assaulted. At no time was he placed "under arrest," so "resisting" would also be a false charge. This young man has grounds for several civil rights lawsuits which will be settled in the 7 figures, and rightfully so.</div>
