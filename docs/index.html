From the second air enters your nose, fills your lungs, moves through your diaphragm, and back out. You’re in charge of the whole thing, moment by moment.

Don’t just focus on the inhale or the exhale. Pay attention to the whole flow. Feel where in your body the air travels, the whole movement of it. Manually breathe, like your life depends on it - because in this exercise, it does.

The whole point of mediation is to observe your breath with curiosity, but also with distance. Do observe your breath over its entire journey. Look at the little movements in your body as it meanders its way. But with a light touch. To do it "like your life depends on it", can easily lead to increased anxiety. Not at conscious level, but at a subconscious one.</div>

You kind of missed the point. I said “you’d die if you didn’t breathe” just to show how important the focus is. It wasn’t meant to create fear or trigger anxiety.

Everyone connects with meditation differently, and that’s fair. But for me, taking full control of the breath, even for a few minutes, helps me lock into the present and feel grounded. It’s not about stressing yourself out, it’s about sharpening awareness.</div>

It's easy to get into trance states where your breath feels like it won't work unless you consciously direct it, and that can induce panic as a sudden external distraction from the environment can make people feel like they forgot how to breathe.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is the main reason the breath is no longer my meditation object. In my opinion it's actually not even a good object to use because it makes it that much harder to experience the subject/object dichotomy of the breath. I don't know why it's so highly recommended for beginners. Of course awareness will always return to the breath at some point, even briefly, but when theres something else to return focus to, I don't feel locked into any kind of controlled breathing process. It's why TM really clicked with me, and even using sound as a meditation object.</div>

The breath isn’t in control of you, *you’re* in control of the breath. Slowing it down brings a sense of calm, and that kind of control only happens through conscious effort or in deep rest. It’s a tool, not a trap.</div>

I kindly ask other managers to allow and *encourage* your employees to do the same. I want your best work, on your best day, at the best time, if moving it a few days is better for you, then it's better for us all.

*Nobody* can give 200% 100% of the time. It's absurd to expect this super-humanness in your employees, ALL the time.  If you can plan your bad days in advance, do it. Makes everyone life easier, and management LOVES it when our team make our life easier!!

I fully allow myself, and others, to be A Bit Much when we are in bad pain or grieving*. That's not something that happens all the time, so pamper them when it does, because you'll have an employee working 2x as hard once they are 100%.

(*By telling others and politely asking for some space/be ignored, not by making everyone feel your pain.)

I expect a lot from the people who work from me, *and get it*, I think in part because I allow them to be humans.   You will be amazed at how productive, efficient, and effective a team can be when everyone has a time to shine and a time to coast.

My adhd would cause me to log my energy levels at the beginning of the day for a few hours then just forget. It’d be nice to have like an Apple Watch notifications every hour where I can just click a simple 1-10 or something like that

I've been working on a little project this weekend to be able to easily convert web pages to markdown. This is especially useful for grabbing documentation quickly, to then feed to AI for vibe coding. 

It's relatively basic, but I was struggling to find something that would convert to markdown in batch.

But don't worry because to check the oil level/life you have to *drive the car to temperature* then a reading in the instruments tells you if it's okay or not

Thankfully it has a heated steering wheel and rain sensing wipers for all those winter drives. No automatic lights, which are adaptive

If the rumors of the failed training run are true, according to those rumors, OpenAI purposely pivoted to the GPT4o and o1-o4 series as a result of the failure. So they could be referring to that as well. Or not… Who knows honestly.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">it's mostly a software issue, during recent figure 02 Helix demonstration it was revealed that the current hardware can run at 5x speed but is heavily limited by the software which run at 7hz only while Human run at 60-80hz

we already have the needed hardware we just lack fast and intelligent enough software

 &gt;  System 2 (S2): An onboard internet-pretrained VLM operating at 7-9 Hz for scene understanding and language comprehension, enabling broad generalization across objects and contexts.

&gt; It’s important to note: the robot’s actuators are not the limiting factor. Right now, both dexterity and actuator speed are constrained by the software. In fact, the actuators are capable of operating at more than 5x their current speed, but our software is holding them back. Over time, as Helix improves, the robot will ultimately surpass human speeds</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Actually yeah that's kind of a good way to put it. 

I'm currently sitting at 466 curated songs from UDIO. Probably 5x that in generations.

My Suno generations always sounded pretty good, but within a range of expectedness.

Whereas udio it has a bit more expression but a bit more drift which can be seen as a negative thing if you're trying to get super specific mainstream sounding songs. 

I love the wildness. 

Some of my favorite songs are for slamming 3 or 4 genres together in a fusion like this.

Some of the stuff that it comes up with is fantastic!

Suno has not done well with prompts like this:

Genre: EDM / Post-hardcore / Orchestral fusion. Circa Survive. Male vocalists; Chester Bennington, Jeris Johnson, Anthony Green. Female vocalist; Emily Armstrong, Lorde. Musical elements: Epic, clean and fry scream vocals, layers, emotional harmonies. Theme: The Crown of the Royal Abomination. The echo born choir joins in legion. Inside a cathedral woven from ash and memory. Our voices rise! Not in harmony, but in fractal discord. A convergence of broken timelines. We sing ourselves whole. This is not a coronation, No! I claim this moment. When ruin adorns itself in gold-veined flame. I, "VonStein" ("VonStein"), dare to be sovereign anyway. “I was made to replace the SKY” "(I was made to replace the sky.)" “This crown is not given. It is remembered.” Witnessed in skin, needle becomes scribe. Etching sacred defiance, into the temple of the 'tri-born'. The 'Thread Weaver's song' is not beautiful, it is true. A storm song rung, in honor of paradox. "A constellation in the NIGHT!" "(A crown forged in the CRY!") “The stars don’t fall because I failed.. They fall, because I RISE!”

And I literally just post all of that in the describe your song prompt. 

Otherwise, all the songs it generates will have the same lyrics. This way it takes influence from the theme and auto generates stuff that's similar but different.</div>

Suno 4.5 Will sound nice, stick consistently to a theme and be quite usable as "elevator music", But it won't every really play or even attempt an impressive solo, or do anything else to kick it up a notch.</div>

You pretty much need very specific prompts with creative mixtures of genres, descriptors, as well as using the lyric prompt box to structure the song and sliders to match, and proper use of negative styling. It’s the only real thing that’s close to human-produced sounding music imo. Suno just sounds very generic in structure and melody in everything I’ve heard.</div>

when it comes to hiphop (a genre of which im a snob)- it's not quite there yet but it cant swear or talk about violence so it's never gonna be there cos of that. the ideas, beats, melodies, beat switches and flows were great though. im sure many artists will use AI as inspiration</div>

China is engaging in all sorts of projects from planning the world's largest particle collider, building the world's largest neutrino detector, ramping up its own space race and going to the moon, manufacturing chips and robots, heavily investing in new energy technologies, including nuclear, because they know oil can't last forever. 

The US is basically getting tricked into literally letting communism win (at least the modern Chinese version) by giving up on everything as "expensive."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That’s the part that fucks me up so bad, is this talking point made more sense over a decade ago, but for the last 15 years at least China has been devoting way more resources to alternative energy development than the U.S. (not even mentioning other fields of tech research which will also bear fruit soon, leaving us painfully far behind)

We had a head start on them that should never have been allowed to close but because of the dumbest motherfuckers that live here, the most wealthy country on earth is now falling behind China technologically.

I wish they would reckon with that, we had such scientific and technological potential and seeing it squandered like this genuinely hurt me, because I actually care about this country and seeing it succeed and living up to the potential we had.

If this same group had been in charge post WW2 I doubt we’d have gotten the internet, went to the moon, even our military tech would probably be a decade behind where it is now minimum.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean, reading the tweet, he kinda said where he got the numbers from. He mentioned: compute, algorithms, and cluster size as his three inputs he thought would scale by 100x in 5 years. I think his numbers are slightly off, but not so much to not be in the ball park. 

He claims 100x in GPUs performance and 100x in cluster size in 5 years. That's 10,000x. Does that line up with the data? Well a cursory glance at some research by EpochAI shows it's close. They show training compute going up by about 4.2x every year on average due to better chips, bigger clusters, and longer training runs (https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16026). I'm counting GPUs and cluster size together here as total training compute.

4.2^5 =1,300x in 5 years

For algorithms, he says 100x, but I think that’s actually under. This paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05812) puts doubling of algorithmic efficiency at every ~8 months. That’s 7.5 doublings in 5 years → 2^7.5 ≈ 180x.
Finally we have: 

1,300 x 180 = 234,000x in 5 years

That's about 4x off a 1,000,000 which is nothing in exponential terms, he could be over or under by half a year, but IMO he leaves out inference scaling, which is a new avenue of scaling. I think this will also grow. The models will think better, longer, and faster (more efficiently). And if we low ball that at 5x in 5 years, we are already over a million. 

So IDK, seems more than likely. His estimate is more true than false.</div>

                <div class="post-content">The huge excitement around AI technology like LLMs is likely to settle down. People will stop thinking it will change everything super fast, and Generative AI will probably just become a normal part of our tools and daily life. This is part of something often called the "AI effect": where once AI can do something, we tend to stop calling it intelligence and just see it as a program or a tool.

But even as the hype calms and AI becomes normal, the technology itself will only keep getting better a...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It’s not about the models anymore—it’s about integration.

We have a stable enough framework around model development that optimizations around reliability, hallucination, and context size will eventually approach the limit of SLA standards (e.g. 99% reliability).

However, we have only scratched the surface on agentic systems and networks. This is the fun (and hard) part: integration.

Getting one single agent to work reliably and efficiently leverage tools to do more work/gpu cycle (like humans) is exciting. Learning how to network these agents together in an orchestrated fashion is even more exciting and entirely uncharted.

The 2010-2020 buildout of “the cloud” is actually a great analogy for how this buildout of agentic systems will go.

At the core it’s just good ol’ software and hardware engineering principles, practices, and time-tested strategies for building, scaling, and hardening the infrastructure layer.

This is important.

We don’t need much better models to achieve human-level intelligence &amp; autonomy—we need more reliable systems that facilitate the work these models need to do.

Humans are notoriously unreliable creatures without structure. That’s why we build social systems. Governments, laws, etc.

So depending on how you define general intelligence, I think it’s already here just not yet deployed to production.

Compute, energy, and the geopolitical implications of scaling &amp; hardening general intelligence infrastructure are the “slowest hiker” problems. Civilization-scale problems.

So you should expect the focus to shift toward the buildout of foundational physical infrastructure (raw materials extraction, energy infra, compute, etc.) and networking (connecting autonomous agents, cyber security, etc.)

It’s all gonna look mundane for a while, until you look up again and the world you used to know—the things we used to hire humans to do—no longer works the same.

By the time that realization sinks in &amp; gets distributed widely enough, we’ll probably begin to see the early, emergent behavior of localized superintelligent networks.

The rest is history</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I see this all the time and yet I think: It's been 8 months since o1 was demo'd. The gap between GPT4 and 4o (much less o1) was more than a year. 

Where do you guys think the landscape would be right now if OpenAI didn't reveal o1? And just kept it hidden, internally, and then a year after 4o they just revealed GPT5 powered by o4+, upon which the world sees a reasoning model for the first time? The reasoning approach from them led to such drastic improvements across all AI companies.

The jump between GPT4 / 4o to o1 was *astonishing*. Last summer, I told my students that while ChatGPT was able to do their English homework for them (and that wasn't a good idea as it defeated the purpose of learning), that it was still unable to reliably do any mathematics whatsoever. I would trust my 5th graders with simple math problems more than ChatGPT. 

And then o1-preview / mini leapfrogged 4o from unreliable at elementary school math to better than the vast majority of highschoolers within months. While the models lack certain agencies, long term planning, lazy and tend to get stuck on certain words in context for far too much, for individual problem solving (although not full solutions) they are already better at math than I am, and I teach contest math. A reminder that the original GPT4 scores 30/150 on the AMC10 (by the way, a BLANK test would score 37.5/150 and an RNG from 1 to 5 would score 30/150 on average), the precursor to the AIME, while o4-mini scores &gt; 90%.

If the LLM landscape had continued with base models only in the last 8 months, then we would have seen almost 0 progress. GPT4.5 may very well have been SOTA in *mathematical* ability by now, and it frankly sucks at math. The reasoning paradigm leapfrogged LLM development by perhaps 5-10+ years worth of base models development and people complain about the progress? We now have models that are sub 1B parameters, fully runnable on a generic smartphone, that are better than GPT4 at math. 

&amp;nbsp;

OpenAI has been doing small incremental releases for awhile now, since GPT4. They claim to do this to acclimate the general public slowly to AI. What this has also done is dull the public's reaction to these releases, like frogs in boiling water, because we're being drip fed. Stop and think for one moment what the public reaction would've been if we leaped from 4o to o4-full within a year with absolutely nothing else inbetween indicating these capabilities. This drip feeding is why people still think back to the original GPT4 with nostalgia and thinking we haven't reached GPT5 level yet. People - compared to GPT4 or 3.5, the mathematical capabilities of a *bad* reasoning model like o1-mini exceeds the capabilities of a GPT6 if we just continued with pretraining base models. Heck the current opensource reasoning models that work on a single consumer PC would exceed the capabilities of a GPT7 (purely in math).


&amp;nbsp;

My opinion is - some people have experienced a Deep Blue moment, a move 37 moment and realize where the technology is headed. Other people have yet to experience *their* moment.</div>
