It’s the kind of thing I would usually have spent an hour trying and failing to build a formula for, then 30 mins doing by hand, but I spent 2 mins writing a prompt, ChatGPT spit out a beautiful formula, and it worked the first time.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/TommyShelbyPFB:

---

Most people are not aware that the most famous UFO video that has been released by the Pentagon is only a snippet of the entire video.

Why has the public still not seen the full 4+ minutes of the Gimbal video that allegedly shows a fleet of crafts flying in a formation?

                        <div class="comment-body">There was a submarine military member who came forward and said they were going underwater as well near the tic tac event. It was in that long Nimitz ufo documentary on YouTube. 

I always wondered what happened to that data.

The question of performance is key. Collaboration of sensory data is just another layer, and proof of them moving underwater at high speeds is a whole new level of performance in terms of engineering. 

Kevin Day was the radar operator that tracked them. His account of their performance is mind bending. I'd like to see that data. 

Difficult to imagine everyone is telling a similar lie across different professions concerning the same event, but I'd love to see more.</div>

Even if productivity rises by 50%, in most jobs that rely on human brains that means that you need 50% less staff which means that all people have to compete heavily for jobs, which results in very low wages.</div>

Automated plugins could already halve most finance teams 5+ years ago, but getting middle aged finance people to make big changes is almost impossible.

The issues generally being dealt with by finance are tertiary to bookkeeping and more like plugging business process holes. Or 'customer service' (internal customer service).

What will happen in the short term is finance teams will go from 10-15 people to 2 very smart people, one accountant and one CS degree with some finance accumen.

The latter is one which AI models are starting to reduce. The former is being tackled by competition from new companies.

The change will happen either because established businesses benefit from AI adoption or because new companies are more efficient and take over older ones.</div>

Labor is way cheaper and regardless of what people think they still have high quality workers there.  Plus their workers will work 80 to 90 hours a week and not complain about it because that's the situation they live in.  

The best jobs will probably be blue collar as plumber, electrician, etc are not being replaced but issue is people will flock to the skilled trades when there are not white collar jobs leading trades to pay even less.  Honestly we are all fucked.  The billionaire class will control everything and the rest of us will fight for scraps.

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah the reasoning behind why AI will replace copywriter is identical to the reasoning tech bros have which is... shit.

AI is definitely more efficient than a human at producing mid copy. But content / copy is already massively oversaturated. To actually be effective, you need to produce exceptional shit, something AI is nowhere close to doing without human input.

Producing loads of "good enough" copy at scale for cheap isn't an effective strategy. In fact we've been paying our copywriters *more*, and telling them to use the time that AI efficiency gives to produce better, more unique and compelling content. And we're destroying the competition who have obviously slashed their human budget and gone in hard on AI.

For every 3 Claude generated articles they churn out, we put out 1 genuinely good  one. It's working extremely well because when everyone can generated 5-6/10 content, why the fuck would you bother to read it from a brand?</div>

Their naming scheme is already pro for the big model and flash for the smaller model, so it makes sense to keep using this. Flash-lite also makes sense because it's immediately clear that it's smaller than flash.</div>

I have my ideal vision of the end of the year written out alongside what I do not want to happen, and I feed that to ChatGPT or Claude AI (I used Claude). Also, I am using their pro models so keep that in mind.

I then ask it to create motivational messages for me based on my visions and designed to light a fire under me. You can tweak the style by asking it to take on different personalities such as Davi...</div>

I have done the same thing by creating a david goggins persona using claude. Along with giving it my vision, I also give it my daily task and habits list(completed and non completed ones). If I am lacking on my daily tasks, then the AI also urges me sternly based upon the completion percentage.  
  
I have also integrated this with telegram and run a cron job every hour, so that the AI can send the motivation message automatically on my phone and start a conversation with me.  
  
I am using a custom script for creating the personas.

This has become my accountability partner for day to day activities.

Its very very very easy to get on these lists. It's like wondering how to get e-mail spam. The real issue is that if there are enough of these fake grannies, the scammers will find a way to detect them or filter the number blocks.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This was me pre-election. Post election, I entered "bury my head in the sand mode." 

I unfollowed anything on Reddit that mentioned the news, politics, whatever. I unsubscribed from all news e-newsletters. I removed instagram from my phone. Already quit twitter when it was acquired and only use FB for marketplace, so I have gone news free, and frankly it's glorious.  

I used to work in the news industry, so for years I prided myself in knowing every detail of everything going on. But it caused a lot of stress, anxiety and frankly, hate and anger toward those that believed opposite of me.  

Give it a try, it's great down here in the sand!</div>

You are spot on though, we really are being robbed of the little things in life by the constant barrage of notifications and scrolling.</div>

1. How did you automate grayscale, and why sunset?
2. How did you track the sessions on social media?
3. Do you now spend a lot more time on computer or other devices?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thanks. Yeah I was in a bit of a rut for a while where I didn't feel very empowered so this have been a nice change for me. 

Good questions. 

1) You can use the shortcuts app on iOS, I did sunset because it has an automation that's tied to that and feels like once the sun goes down I should put my phone down :) 

2) I use Roots (found the app on reddit), but I think there are a lot out there if you search "screen time" and just see which one resonates with you most.

3) I do spend slightly more time on my computer, but it's more intentional time. I definitely have not seen myself fully replacing phone usage with computer or other things... it's more like if I really want to reply to an email or look at something I go to my computer and spend 10 minutes doing it, instead of opening my phone and getting sucked in for an hour. 

Good luck!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">it's a good question, native iOS blocking doesn't really do it so you have to use an app to do it.   
  
I use Roots (found it on reddit), it lets you block certain parts of the day and keep certain apps blocked at all times so it forces the intentionality. There are several out there which offer this type of blocking. I've also tried Jomo and one sec in the past. If you search "app blocking" on the App Store you'll see a few you can check out.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Have an honest convo with yourself. Is this truly something you think you can battle and conquer by utilizing moderation? Remember that the more honest you are with yourself, the better the outcome for your wellbeing. 

1a. If you can moderate, try deleting the app off your phone. Will make it to where you have to be at your computer to access which adds an obstacle. 
1b. If you can’t use it in moderation, delete your account. Think about your life and wellbeing in the long run!

2. Reflect. What do you feel when you’re scrolling/surfing? Are you feeling anxious? Are you avoiding responsibility? Are you numbing out unprocessed hurt or loneliness? find and label those feelings to learn more about yourself and why you keep excess surfing. 

3. Act. Write out 3-4 attributes of what your dream life would be like. Do you want to own a business? Pick up a hobby? Connect with others? Once you have an end goal in mind you can work backwards with activities to fill your time. Ideally, once you invest enough time in these activities you will look forward to them so earnestly it will trump a desire to mindlessly surf. 

4. Remember your “why”. Why do you want to stop surfing? To make more of your time in earth? To better others? Create relationships? Learn more and create more? Keeping this “why” in mind will help you during times of temptation.

Best wishes!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Unfortunately, I can't use it in moderation and I'm seriously considering deleting the account. I will put the advice into practice. The phrase 'Think about your life and well-being in the long term!' really opened my eyes. I appreciate the advice! I am truly reflecting on what is best for me. I know moderation is an option, but I also recognize that it's hard not to replace one addiction with another. I'm thinking about how to find a healthier balance without falling into this cycle of substitution. I'll try to reflect on the feelings that come up when I'm browsing and see how that can help me change this pattern. And, of course, keeping my 'why' in mind.

                        <div class="comment-body">Brought a pediatric patient back for emergency heart surgery (about 14yrs old). He was very nervous. Outlook looked grim. I held his hand as they began to induce anesthesia. He looked like he was about to cry. I told him there was nothing to worry about. He was gonna be just fine. He gripped my hand super tight as the propfol took hold, looked me in the eye and said "I'm going to die, aren't I?". I told him I would be there in PACU when he woke up. He died on the table. I was the last thing he ever saw. 8 years later I still think about that kid. I still see his face. The fear in his eyes. I still feel guilty that I lied right to his face...

EDIT: Didn't expect this to get as much traction as it did, so I will clarify. I am in a much better place now. I'm still in pediatrics but I have regular therapy and am in a strong place mentally. I appreciate all the kind words. The guilt I feel doesn't weigh on me like it did all those years ago thankfully. Hug your kids and tell them you love them. ✌️</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm not a nurse but have several family members who are and I've heard some strange stories from them about patients. My aunt was a hospice nurse and they had a new patient arrive. No one knew much about him, except he had no family and no one came to visit him. He was in his late 60s and his medical proxy was a lawyer.


My aunt was in the guy's room one night checking on him and the man bolted upright in bed from a deep sleep and screamed that she needed to protect him "from the people in the floor" that were going to take him away. She said it was almost like a scene from a horror movie. And just like that, the man collapsed back on the bed and went into cardiac arrest and died.


It turned out the guy had been sentenced to life in prison for two homicides. He killed his ex wife and her new boyfriend and while serving his life sentence, he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and had somehow gotten compassionate parole. My aunt was convinced the "people in the floor" were demons coming to drag him to Hell. No one came to the guys funeral except for my aunt and the guys lawyer. His kids abandoned him.</div>

Because the IRS would only be able to look into people with small estates because investigations cost money?

Just me? 😀 ok.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I (with the help of chatGPT) crunched the numbers for a **New Yorker making $60K/year** to see what would happen if we **scrapped income tax completely** and replaced it with a **30% sales tax**. Spoiler: **you would take home way more money, but everything you buy would get a lot pricier.**

Assuming this person is **reasonably responsible** (aka not blowing their whole paycheck on Uber Eats and overpriced lattes):

* Fresh Food (not taxed in NY)**:** $6,000
* Processed Food (taxable at 8.875%): $4,000
* Dining Out (taxable at 8.875%): $6,000
* Housing &amp; Utilities (not taxable in NY): $20,000
* Transportation (gas, maintenance, etc. - taxed): $3,500
* Clothing &amp; Apparel (taxed): $2,500
* Entertainment (taxed): $2,000
* Healthcare (mostly not taxable): $4,000

**Total spending:** **$48K**  
**Total taxable spending:** **$18K**

# 💰 Scenario 1: The Current Tax System

Right now, you're getting taxed at every angle:

🔹 Federal Income Tax: $8,299  
🔹 New York State Income Tax: $3,135  
🔹 Sales Tax (8.875% on $18K taxable spending): $1,597  
**💸 Total Taxes Paid: $13,031**  
**🏡 Take-Home Pay After Taxes: $46,969**

Not the worst, but still, **your paycheck gets wrecked before it even hits your account.**

# 🛍️ Scenario 2: No Income Tax + 30% Sales Tax (aka "Keep Your Paycheck, but Pay at the Register")

Here, **you keep your full salary**, but **every taxable thing you buy gets hit with a 30% sales tax** instead:

🔹 Federal Income Tax: $0  
🔹 New York State Income Tax: $0  
🔹 Sales Tax (30% on $18K taxable spending): $5,400  
**💸 Total Taxes Paid:** **$5,400**  
**🏡 Take-Home Pay After Taxes:** **$54,600**

So yeah, you **take home $7,631 more per year** under this system.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I honestly think a presidential o3, with a less censored worldview than current public models, would absolutely do a much better job making decisions than Trump.  If you just had aides and cabinet members going out and doing the work, coming back to the president for final sign off, which is basically how it works.  It would almost certainly do a better job than Biden as well, who was clearly mentally compromised.

By 2028?  We will probably have several models running that are better equipped to be president than most if not all of the candidates running for the job.</div>

It has been going down with each successive model.  But it is still way too high and really kills the usefulness of these for serious work.</div>

And this is if you're very, very, very lucky. Absolute best case scenario. Which i don't even see why the hell would happen, given that we could save a lot of people today that we don't save and just let them rot. Not sure why anyone will find it worth it to keep you around, if AI can do everything better than you. Maybe a small minority for sex and entertainment. But certainly not 7 billion.</div>
