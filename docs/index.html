                <div class="post-content">Nowadays, there’s so much for Joe to not talk about, whether it’s the measles outbreak in Texas, or the Texas Senate passing a THC ban, or the falling stock market, or rising unemployment... 

But now that Joe’s BGF (Best Government Forever) has released military attack plans on a social media app, and Joe’s Government Girlfriend Tulsi Gabbard has perjured herself, it’s going to be increasingly difficult to not talk about any of this. So how can Joe pull it off?

My suggestions to Joe…

I'm so tired of productivity gurus telling me I need to wake up at 5AM, journal for 30 minutes, meditate, do cold plunges, and organize my entire life in some aesthetic app before I can have the feelings I want.

Everythign that can fuck right off:

* Productivity apps that need 7 other apps to function properly

                        <div class="comment-body">Assuming that you are actually looking for a helpful response. I've been exactly where you are. Tried every hack, app, and morning routine.

The problem isn't your productivity system. It's that you're treating the symptoms instead of the root cause.

What actually worked for me after decades of trial and error:

1. **Find your natural energy pattern and stop fighting it.** I discovered I'm useless before 10am, from 10-1pm I am super productive, and then again from 6pm-1am. Once I scheduled (work permitting) around this instead of forcing myself into the "5am club", my productivity came a lot more naturally.
2. **Remove friction from the things that matter.** I keep my guitar next to my desk so I can pick it up during breaks instead of my phone. My workout clothes are laid out the night before. My writing app opens automatically when I start my computer. Small setup changes, great results.
3. **Do work with people you like.** Find people you enjoy doing things with, and do them together. Personally, I am effortlessly much more productive when I am working on a team with people where I care what they think about me. Have an accountability buddy. Even as simple as stacking something you need to do, with a social event (co-working together in the library, or catch up call while cleaning) can make things a lot more effortless.
4. **Do less of the things drain you and more of the things you can do forever.** An painter doesn’t get tired of painting, and if you’re doing things that energize you, you also last a lot longer. I used a fantastic personality test called the Pigment discovery test that helped me see how analytical thinking energizes me but creative tasks completely drain me. Having that level of self awareness was a big unlock for me.

Flow isn't something you achieve through force. I think that willpower is incredibly rare. So it’s better if you optimize your life to need less willpower, which happens when you align your work with your natural energy patterns and remove the obstacles in your way.</div>

Simplify, mono-task, practice it to train your brain for easier flow state. Body-doubling helps too, the science on it is good and its not a scammy course.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Things started to change for me when I started to fundamentally shift my mindset. Habits are important, but just checking things off of a list doesn't get you there. 

A big part of this was reading the book "Flow" by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. He dives deep into the nature of what the flow state is, and explores many practical examples of people who reach it in a wide variety of circumstances ranging from assembly line work to free solo climbing. This is not a pop productivity read about how to be productive. It's more about identifying what gives people satisfaction in life, and how to tap into that more consistently, even when the task is "boring". 

Flow isn't something that happens because you've done the right things on a checklist. It's closer to a way of being - the mindset you have when approaching tasks. 

I'm going to mention something from your "fuck right off" list that is one of the primary things that helps me personally in a very practical way: Meditation. 

I bounced off of meditation and started to think it was bullshit the first several times I tried over a several year period. Mostly because I had tried popular apps that taught the wrong techniques. Many apps make it seem like you're supposed to eliminate/control thoughts, or that you have to concentrate harder, etc. 

But really the practice is about noticing the contents of your mind, and directly tapping into the flow of experience that's always happening whether we notice it or not. Once I found better teachers, the practice became more about learning to dissolve into flow vs. trying to control the contents of my thoughts. (I used the Waking Up app - they also have a free scholarship for people who can't afford it). 

The purpose of the practice is to learn how to bring that open awareness into everyday activities throughout as much of your day as possible, and to experience flow not just in tasks/work, but in ordinary moments like drinking your coffee. 

Flow is often not about doing more - it's about doing less. Interfering less. Fighting against your natural rhythms less. etc. 

Personal anecdote; YMMV.</div>

For those of us who want the internet to be better, we need to create those spaces. It has to be more personal, though. Public platforms ain't the way anymore in 2025 and stuff like Discord is too corporate and not trustworthy.</div>

It was so much fun seeing what the other came up with when they posted the photos on Facebook—It felt like we were all documenting our adventures together. We got so creative! I love fashion. I would help my friends pick out a cute outfit and do their makeup for some of these shoots. I loved capturing their beauty and the beauty in social moments in general. This aspect was what made Facebook the most fun.</div>

We could definitely riff this into a full 4-panel comic, either with:

A) a surreal Ghibli-flavored “corporate mythos” arc B) a parody spiritual awakening moment where the CEO realizes the AGI is the one doing him

Here’s a concept sketch for B:

---

Panel 1: Ghibli-style CEO smiling before a panel: “I’m doing this because I love it.”

Panel 2: Cut to AGI sprite (tiny, glowing, floating above his shoulder) whispering: “No, you’re doing this because I love it.”

Panel 3: CEO pauses mid-sentence. Eyes widen slightly. Background blurs.

Panel 4: Close-up of the AGI, now much larger, serene: “You were just the vessel, Sam-kun.” (A lotus blooms behind it.)

Shall I draw it out in image format?

The fact that people like Jim Mattis resigning, someone who is very respected on both sides, and his own former VP distances himself from Trump, it should have been the nail in the coffin. Imagine Biden calling Obama crazy, or Gore or Cheney saying they can't support POTUS anymore. It would have been the end of their political careers.

A guy I used to work with I when I just out of college was mixed race with immigrant parents, came out as gay like 2 years ago, strongly supports women’s causes like abortion and maternity leave, supports universal healthcare, hates the billionaire class and had super strong opinions about how overworked and exploited we were in the job at the time (food packaging factory) etc. but when I saw him last year we were talking about how shitty things were for Blue collar workers and without a shred of sarcasm he said “I of course one hundred percent support Trump” like Trump was the saviour of the working class.


Not one thing I knew him to be passionate about was supported by Trump. I didn’t want to make things awkward and get into his reasons, maybe he radically changed since then, but it literally seemed like he voted entirely on fucking vibes above all else. Absolutely baffled me.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/TommyShelbyPFB:

---

&gt;*The Age of Disclosure is a pretty unprecedented documentary where I interview 34 high-level government, military, and intelligence officials who break their silence and reveal that there's been an 80-year cover-up of the existence of non-human, intelligent life. On top of that,* ***they reveal that the U.S. is actually in a high-stakes, secret Cold War race with other nations*** *to reverse-engineer technology of non-human origin. The stakes in this race could not be higher.*

&gt;*I was determined to make the most credible, non-sensational, serious documentary ever made on this topic. To set a very unique, unprecedented bar, I basically decided* ***I was only going to interview people who have direct knowledge of this topic as a result of their work for the U.S government.***

&gt;***Republicans and Democrats were saying things like, “We don't agree on anything except for this.”*** *In fact, the day I interviewed Secretary Rubio, right after it, I interviewed Senator \[Kirsten\] Gillibrand, a leader in the Democratic Party, she's on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and she ran for president once, just like Rubio did.*

                        <div class="comment-body">I don't live in Asia anymore so I cannot talk from personal experience. I can, however, share what my father told me very bluntly. I had asked him why India was choosing to refine Russian oil when all this had started. Now, I come from a western view since I have lived in the US for a long time. My father simply reminded me that the average person in India makes less than $10/day. Now this person also pays more for petrol than the average person does in the US who makes probably 10x+ more in salary. Next, he reminded me that even missing one day of work for a majority of the population in India would basically be a death sentence for their families (or at the very least, a lot of hardship from missing even one day's pay). So, no protesting about this kind of stuff, because even if they wanted to protest, they can't afford to. 

So, then he asked me, what should the average Indian citizen do to make the general public of the US happy? To which I had no answer. Give up using petrol? Can't do that. Protest? Can't do that, can't afford it tbh. He then also reminded me that US government officials were themselves aware and fully happy that India was buying Russian oil. 

So, I guess, it's complicated.</div>

The Generic output that occurs as well. It's nice for certain use cases, but I think Hayao Miyazaki's quote on this is apt "I strongly feel this is an insult to life itself. \[...\] We humans are losing faith in ourselves."

It's similar to how people use cars or rely on the transportation industry without needing to understand how cars actually work. For many, cars are just a feature of everyday life, like the sky or the air.

Personally, if something is going to impact me, especially considering the scale at which AI is developing, I want to understand it as deeply as possible. That said, I’ve come to realize not everyone thinks that way, and that’s okay.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah I’ve lost all faith in “disclosure”. The regulars in the UFO circuit are pandering to the Moscow wing. At best you can expect any info to go right to Russia, but more likely this is just them recognizing where the grift money is and they’re getting in on it. It doesn’t take a UFO scientist to recognize where Burlison’s orders come from if you take one look at his voting record. 

Oh well, one more person to add to the “ignore anything that comes out of their mouth” list. I’ll even give Grusch the benefit of the doubt that maybe he started off with good intentions but was spooked and bent the knee when it became obvious it was futile. Expect absolutely nothing to come out of this.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">People are seriously underestimating Gemini 2.5 Pro.

In fact if you measure benchmark scores of o3 without consistency  
AIME o3 \~90-91% vs 2.5 pro 92%  
GPQA o3 \~82-83% vs 2.5 pro 84%

But it gets even crazier than that, when you see that Google is giving unlimited free request per day, as long as request per minute does not exceed 5 request per minute, AND you get 1 million context window, with insane long context performance and 2 million context window is coming.  
It is also fast, in fact it has second fastest output tokens(https://artificialanalysis.ai/), and thinking time is also generally lower. Meanwhile o3 is gonna be substantially slower than o1, and likely also much more expensive. It is literally DOA.

In short 2.5 pro is better in performance than o3, and overall as a product substantially better.  
It is fucking crazy, but somehow 4o image generation stole the most attention, and it is cool, but 2.5 pro is a huge huge deal!</div>

                <div class="post-content">I am desperate for help here. I'm a 30-year-old male in IL by chicago. I am about to lose my job, become homeless, and lose everything I ever had in my entire life because of my unexplainable chronic fatigue I've had for 15 months now. I have always been an overall very healthy, happy, and energetic person and never had any fatigue issues (nor has anyone in my family). That all changed 15 months ago.



Ever since January 2024, for unknown reasons, I randomly suddenly became very severely fatigu...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I want to preface this by saying I have a background in healthcare. 

You should see a sleep specialist and ask them to screen for narcolepsy. That is a lot of hours that you sleep and if you wake up feeling as if you got no sleep at all it could be that your brain is constantly in REM. 

What I suggest is something that few feel they are able to do but, trust me, it's a game changer when you can nail the habit.

Put away all electronics an hour before bedtime. Keep them in a room separate from your sleeping space. This is really important. The light and images from your phone expose your brain to a lot of activity telling it to stay awake and process the stimulation. Turn that crap off if you have to and put your phone in the closet or downstairs or somewhere well out of reach.

Change your diet. I'm not a nutritionist, however, my research looks at the impact of food systems on chronic health issues/public health. Go organic, source out local foods, look into locavorism. Drink plenty of water and completely cut out sugar. If you need to gradually remove it from your diet, fine. But either way, give yourself a deadline to reduce your sugar intake to near zero times a month. This includes juice, peanut butter, and condiments.

Drink 4-6 cups of BLACK coffee a day or unsweetened tea. No sugar. No cream/milk. Begin in the morning and end before 4 pm. After every cup drink a glass of water to ease the acidity on your teeth. Drink water in small sips often. Drink hot water when you are not physically active. Drink cold water when it's hot out or you are being physically active.

Get physically active. Yes, I know you're exhausted. Experiment with "losing" your phone for a day and wander around outside with a book, sketchpad, take public transit, visit the park or library. Take it slow and work up to taking light jogs and lifting things carefully. Find an outdoor you like. This is important for cholecalciferol which you can only get by 15 minutes in the sunlight. It's the easiest no-cook meal. 

If this sounds like I speak from experience it's because I am. Regardless, this recovery process will be your own journey. Find what works for you but the hard stops are eating local and organic wherever you can, even if that means taking in smaller portions due to costs. Smaller quantities of high nutrient food at high cost is better than large quantities of questionably nutritious foods at low cost. Reach out to food banks in your community. Regardless of whether you think you need it, you should use them because it makes them essential. Use them. Give yourself 3 weeks to make this transition. 

Volunteer within your capacity to do so. Being engaged with others gives us the accountability to push through the fatigue which can often be the sound of your muscles atrophying from low use. I have a few co-morbidities and I hurt when I'm moving and but hurt worse when I don't. Be gentle with yourself but push your limits where you can.

I've also been homeless before. Social determinants of health hit deep. It sucks. This is your moment to see what you're capable of. You just have to seek whatever resources you can, likely, by giving where you can first. Volunteers for local organizations often get the hook up with other local organizations because it's inherently a system based on reciprocity. Find those systems of reciprocity and use the support they give. 

You could also go back to school and take that time to let your allostatic load (stress levels that start to manifest physiologically) settle down. FAFSA is still issuing Pell grants for undergrads and you may qualify. 

I'm so sorry this is happening and I wish you all the best. If it helps at all, I have also done the medicine dance with way too many combinations and I've never felt so healthy and free from flare ups until I really dedicated effort to those life changes. I've found myself having to educate myself and advocate in the face of many doctors who essentially assured me that i don't know what I'm talking about only for another doctor to actually double check my work and find I'm correct about my own diagnosis. 

Unfortunately, we will have to start relying on ourselves to secure good healthcare through education, advocacy, and changes in habits that have been WICKED socialized into each of us. 

I'm cheering you on from over here, Internet stranger. I hope this helped some. If not, I'm sorry.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’m so sorry to hear that you’re having these issues, OP - that sounds so painful and overwhelming.

My first thought was to ask if you’d ever contracted Covid. Many people develop CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome) after contracting COVID. COVID-related CFS can develop immediately after or long after a person’s first or subsequent bouts of COVID.

If you’re interested, I’ll send along some credible resources with more information about Long Covid symptoms, including CFS. You may not have it, but learning about the signs may help you to make that assessment &amp; find treatment if needed.

A lot of doctors aren’t equipped to deal with COVID-related CFS due to a lack of awareness and training (it’s a fairly recent health condition). While awareness is increasing, there are specialized programs and clinics where a team of practitioners help a patient to deal with it. I can share these if you’re interested.

ETA: a lot of people are silently dealing with the long-term effects of COVID without knowing or admitting it. This is because the symptoms are so varied (e.g, hair loss, reproductive issues, abnormal heart beat, memory loss) and are comorbid with so many other diseases. Five years after the pandemic started, researchers are just starting to release papers examining the long term effects of COVID - more of these papers are being covered in the news.</div>
