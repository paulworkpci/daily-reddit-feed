                <div class="post-content">I've experimented a bit over the past 6 months with various ways to cut back on doom scrolling. I came across a few reddit posts that inspired me to try things like a 24-hour detox, or even 10 days cutting back. It worked, but then my screen time tended to fluctuate a lot afterwards.

I saw some posts about the idea of a 30 day plan. Having 4 separate weekly plans made it more digestible. In case it's helpful, wanted to share. Random Redditors have given me pretty good inspiration to make change...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I use Roots. iPhone and Android don't offer much customization and friction natively. I tried settings limits with iOS in the past and always just ignored them. 

I found it on reddit but I like that I can set up scroll replacements so it redirects me to the things I picked out each Sunday when apps get blocked, and it has monk mode blocking which adds extra friction. I'd basically do a scheduled monk mode downtime 5-9am, and 6pm-midnight, and then use it to keep distracting apps blocked at all times other than the downtime.

If you search "screen time" on the App Store you can find apps that are much better than the native functionality if you want to get serious about adding friction and sticking to limits.</div>

in 2025 Rich Sutton really is vindicated with all his major talking points (like search time learning and RL reward functions) being the pivotal building blocks of AGI, huh?

They basically figured out how to give AI both short-term and long-term memory that actually works. Like, imagine your brain being able to remember an entire book while still processing new info efficiently.

The whole search-time learning thing is starting to look more and more like what Sutton was talking about.

This thing can handle 2M+ tokens while being faster than regular transformers. That’s like going from a USB stick to a whole SSD of memory, but for AI.

This is a dope step forward. 2025’s starting strong ngl.

                        <div class="comment-body">Oh my right…this is *properly* exciting, isn’t it? This paper feels like a seismic shift, continual learning during inference? 

That’s the sort of thing Rich Sutton’s been banging on about for years, and now it’s here. The neural long-term memory module is a stroke of genius, dynamically memorising and forgetting based on surprise, which is exactly how human memory works. 

It’s not just about scaling to 2M+ tokens; it’s about the model *adapting* in real-time, learning from the flow of data without collapsing under its own weight. This doesn’t really just feel like your typical OpenAI RLHF incremental progress….it’s a foundational leap towards ASI.

The implications for tasks like genomics or time series forecasting are staggering. 

Honestly, if this isn’t vindication for Sutton’s vision, I don’t know what is. Bloody brilliant. Thank you for sharing.</div>

1.  Realtime robotics


2.  Model reasoning using images/3d scenes/4d scenes.  The 2d scene was dropped in a Microsoft paper today : https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07542


3.  Continuous Learning.  This paper claims to solve that.


As near as I can tell, once all 3 problems are solved adequately, integrated into a single unified system - a true AGI - and then trained to the median human level, that's AGI.  </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I remember seeing a paper about using surprise to create a vector database of facts. Essentially it would read the information and do a prediction pass over it. If the actual text was sufficiently different from the predicted text the model would be "surprised" and use that as an indicator that the topic has changed or some piece of relevant information has been found. 

I listened to a notebook LM analysis of the paper and it sounded like the biggest deal was that rather than having a big context window it could shove context into a long term memory and then recover it as needed for the current task. So it could have an arbitrarily large long ten memory without affecting bogging down the working context. 

I didn't quite grok how it was different beyond that, though this is a good way to start building a lifetime's worth of data that a true companion AI would need.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/NewParadigmInstitute:

---

An Air Force veteran and whistleblower sits down exclusively with Ross Coulthart to share what he says happened while he was part of a long-rumored UAP retrieval program, including the recovery of what he describes as an "egg-shaped" object, unlike any man-made craft he's ever seen.

NewsNation's Ross Coulthart will dig further into his claims, including never-before-seen video of an alleged craft recovery and secret meetings with officials on Capitol Hill, Saturday, January 18 at 8p/7C in, “Hunting UFOs: The Crash Retrieval Whistleblower.”

Additionally, Mr. Coulthart will conduct exclusive interviews with three additional military whistleblowers who discuss their knowledge of the program and personal experience working on similar operations with the whistleblower. 

In June 2023, NewsNation was the first television network to present an interview with UFO whistleblower David Grusch. The account has led to multiple Congressional hearings and further reporting on the matter.

Customized instruction that allows a student to progress at his or her own pace gets better results than Procrustean mass education, forcing the slowest to move beyond their pace, and boring the brightest to tears.

It's not just about helping students progress at their own pace, but also teaching them in a way they can understand.

For example, my local library has a room with sewing machines, a 3D printer, a laser cutter, something called a Cricut, and all kinds of craft supplies.  Every bit of it is free. Another branch has little recording studios for people who want to create podcasts.  The list goes on and on.

So check out what's available at your library system.  You may be pleasantly surprised.</div>

He will say that, but the reality is, even if you were super upset, the moment you forgave him he viewed it as a pass for cheating.

To all reading, keep watching shows that make you believe people “work through cheating”. They don’t, the cheater has to work on that themselves and it’s like crack to them because it’s feeding on an insecurity(sometimes abandonment, loss of control, etc).

The moment it happens you treat it for what it is, an egregious treacherous act. You pack up your emotions in a little bag and you leave then and there. The moment you give them a pass they will most definitely be cheating again.

IT WAS NEVER ABOUT YOU. They use cheating to soothe their own emotions and when they figure out you’re unlikely to leave they will continue to soothe their emotions.</div>

Scaling this to learning like they did with alphazero would be very very cost prohibitive at this point. So we'll just be seeing the leading edge at this point.

You'll need to have much more aggressive trimming and path selection in order to work with this comparatively limited compute.

To some degree, this is why releasing to the public is useful. You can have o1 effectively collect more training data on the types of questions people ask. Path is trimmed by users.</div>

Anytime some celebrity says they are going to donate to a charity, half the time, it's just a tax scam. Charity is usually owned by their family or friends, and they can still receive some kind of kickbacks like fancy charity events, etc.</div>

Wealthy people set up charities so they look benevolent. Then they put people they want into high paying positions. Because they "donated" they dont pay taxes. There are no laws on how much of donated money has to go to the cause. There are watch groups but they have no power</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt; MatterGen presents a new opportunity for AI accelerated materials design, complementing our AI emulator MatterSim. MatterSim follows the fifth paradigm of scientific discovery, significantly accelerating the speed of material properties’ simulations. MatterGen in turn accelerates the speed of exploring new material candidates with property guided generation. MatterGen and MatterSim can work together as a flywheel to speed up both the simulation and exploration of novel materials.

This is how all scientific research and development will be done soon. **Simulate, then generate.**</div>

Text that is behind the paywall:

This text appears to have ended our friendship. Elon never responded, and it was not long before he began maligning me on Twitter for a variety of imaginary offenses. For my part, I eventually started complaining about the startling erosion of his integrity on my podcast, without providing any detail about what had transpired between us.

At the end of 2022, I abandoned Twitter/X altogether, having recognized the poisonous effect that it had on my life—but also, in large part, because of what I saw it doing to Elon. I’ve been away from the platform for over two years, and yet Elon still attacks me. Occasionally a friend will tell me that I’m trending there, and the reasons for this are never good. As recently as this week, Elon repeated a defamatory charge about my being a “hypocrite” for writing a book in defense of honesty and then encouraging people to lie to keep Donald Trump out of the White House. Not only have I never advocated lying to defeat Trump (despite what that misleading clip from the Triggernometry podcast might suggest to naive viewers), I’ve taken great pains to defend Trump from the most damaging lie ever told about him. Elon knows this, because we communicated about the offending clip when it first appeared on Twitter/X. However, he simply does not care that he is defaming a former friend to hundreds of millions of people—many of whom are mentally unstable. On this occasion, he even tagged the incoming president of the United States.

All of this remains socially and professionally awkward, because Elon and I still have many friends in common. Which suggests the terms of another another wager that I would happily make, if such a thing were possible—and I would accept 1000 to 1 odds in Elon’s favor:

I bet that anyone who knows us both knows that I am telling the truth.

Everyone close to Elon must recognize how unethical he has become, and yet they remain silent. Their complicity is understandable, but it is depressing all the same. These otherwise serious and compassionate people know that when Elon attacks private citizens on Twitter/X—falsely accusing them of crimes or corruption, celebrating their misfortunes—he is often causing tangible harm in their lives. It’s probably still true to say that social media “isn’t real life,” until thousands of lunatics learn your home address.

A final absurdity in my case, is that several of the controversial issues that Elon has hurled himself at of late—and even attacked me over—are ones we agree about. We seem to be in near total alignment on immigration and the problems at the southern border of the U.S. We also share the same concerns about what he calls “the woke mind virus.” And we fully agree about the manifest evil of the so-called “grooming-gangs scandal” in the U.K. The problem with Elon, is that he makes no effort to get his facts straight when discussing any of these topics, and he regularly promotes lies and conspiracy theories manufactured by known bad actors, at scale. (And if grooming were really one of his concerns, it’s strange that he couldn’t find anything wrong with Matt Gaetz.)

Elon and I even agree about the foundational importance of free speech. It’s just that his approach to safeguarding it—amplifying the influence of psychopaths and psychotics, while deplatforming real journalists and his own critics; or savaging the reputations of democratic leaders, while never saying a harsh word about the Chinese Communist Party—is not something I can support. The man claims to have principles, but he appears to have only moods and impulses.

Any dispassionate observer of Elon’s behavior on Twitter/X can see that there is something seriously wrong with his moral compass, if not his perception of reality. There is simply no excuse for a person with his talents, resources, and opportunities to create so much pointless noise. The callousness and narcissism conveyed by his antics should be impossible for his real friends to ignore—but they appear to keep silent, perhaps for fear of losing access to his orbit of influence.

Of course, none of this is to deny that the tens of thousands of brilliant engineers Elon employs are accomplishing extraordinary things. He really is the greatest entrepreneur of our generation. And because of the businesses he’s built, he will likely become the world’s first trillionaire—perhaps very soon. Since the election of Donald Trump in November, Elon’s wealth has grown by around $200 billion. That’s nearly $3 billion a day (and over $100 million an hour). Such astonishing access to resources gives Elon the chance—and many would argue the responsibility—to solve enormous problems in our world.

So why spend time spreading lies on X?</div>

This is as close as you can get to a dispassionate objective analysis of what has become of Elon. If we can’t agree on this, then I have to assume you will spin anything and everything to make your side to be the good guys. But my side is America at large, and everyone here is ostensibly a part of that. Is your side just whoever agrees with you? Country, law, ethics and morality be damned?</div>

the lack of humility &amp; blatant self promotion is an actual DISEASE! 

people really think that just because a very small % of people become wildly famous &amp; rich from social media, that it’s possible it will happen to them if they post incessantly about their boring lives!? 

it’s corporate mandated narcissism &amp; these tech CEOs are well aware that they’re tapping into a real weakness in ...</div>

Mindfulness is a pretty core part of living a healthy life and is somethign that really should be emphasized every year of school, I think. Like sure, the internet can be fun but every once in a while you gotta take a step back and think about how you are spending your time and if you are okay with your life going down the path you are headed.

I think social media is great, it allows you to easily reconnect with old friends, but you one really should just limit themselves to like one hour a day at the most. Also stay grounded in teh real world. Sure, you can make online friends but dont get obsessed over people who don't even know you are exist. If they aren't sharing any of their time with you personally then don't waste any sort of emotional efforts on them.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It is important to know that the primary purpose of the Covid operation was to use an exaggerated pandemic to provide cover for a global financial bailout (helicopter money) that would lead to intentional inflation -- thereby resetting federal reserve interest rates.

Look up the BlackRock plan for the Fed from August 2019 called "Going Direct" -- it's all in there, including some clues alluding to "special circumstances" needed to pull this off...

This isn't to disagree with you *at all*, but rather to provide some insight into something most people don't know which ties into exactly what you are saying. Yes, the "vaccines" were bad, but they were primarily a distraction and once you realize that, suddenly it makes sense that they were rolled out in such absurd ways. (To cause division as a diversion.)

The biggest goal was using "Covid" to inject TRILLIONS into the global economy --- distributed to both corporations and individuals just as explained in the Going Direct plan.

Injecting money like that is an increase in *demand*.

Then they used "Covid" to shut down businesses, limit shipping, and to constrict product lines. (Reducing *supply*.)

Increased demand + reduced supply = INFLATION.

INFLATION = resetting federal reserve bank interest rates (which is their primary tool to manipulate the economy. They had to do this because as of 2019 global federal reserve interest rates were ~~down to zero~~ too low.)

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS)

It was all intentional, all part of the plan. And both parties and governments all over the world were in on it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Interesting perspective, but increased demand + decreased supply = increased *prices*, not inflation.

Inflation refers to the devaluation of a currency caused by an increase in the money supply, resulting in more tokens being used to represent the total value being traded. Therefore the value per token goes down.

In fact, shutting down businesses will tend to reduce inflation as it reduces borrowing (which increases the money supply). 

Injecting trillions though.... That would definitely cause inflation. What exactly do you mean by that? How were the trillions "injected"?</div>

Best part is hands are add on. So as hardware advances towards 24 DoF hands you can just plug and play.

this could of course be completely wrong and these robots might need something well above 1-2kwh for continuous function.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/NoDegree7332:

Submission Statement: I saw this exchange and thought it was worth noting that crash retrieval footage, when combined with three credible witnesses willing to verify its authenticity, would be exceptionally hard to dispute. I do hope it shows something exotic or unusual that would be obvious even for a layperson.

It’s not going to be a video of a saucer being loaded onto a flatbed, nor will it be the recovery of an ET body. 

It’ll almost certainly be footage of a nondescript material, most likely not resembling any type of assembled vehicle, power system or other apparatus. 

I’d love to be wrong, but we’ve all been down this path more than once.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">human here. this will probably be my last post online for a long time.

if you did fall for it and assume it was a real human complaining here- know it wasn't my intention to trick you just for the sake of doing it, and you AREN'T stupid for believing it. i think probably most people are in this category.

if you didn't, if you could tell that something was off, please remember- they only get better. this is as bad as they'll ever be. i'm able to spot ai content too, a lot of the time (at least i think so. how can i quantify what i don't know?), but it will get to a point where that's no longer possible. we can't get overconfident. 

the point i wanted to make today was this: there's never been a better time to get offline. there's nothing good left here anymore. it's not worth it. it's all fake. a good 50% of content you see today is either an ad or rage bait. i use ai a lot so i've learned what the "voice" sounds like. i can tell you with near certainty i hear it daily, in youtube scripts, in entire twitter accounts, in front page aita posts, in this subreddit. worse, i've seen it used to run twitter accounts about health advice- to be clear, not to help with grammar and formatting, literally copying chatgpt advice and passing themselves off as human doctors- and to convince people to invest in memecoins. 

we need people with critical thinking and literacy skills more than ever. people WILL prey on and try to make money off of you if you're on any sort of mental health or self help subreddit and it's not as obvious as you'd believe. you can't believe anything you see online. don't even believe me. assume everyone wants to sell you something, assume everyone wants to keep you scrolling, assume all information you see is bullshit. even playing video games or sleeping or staring at a wall and doing nothing would be a better waste of your time than being here. the internet is dead. we need to move on.</div>

I was so excited for computer day at school because we got to explore this new thing called The Internet. 


Maybe the cool part about it was that it wasn't everywhere. That it was this place you had to log on to. Nowadays it's in your pocket and it doesn't feel as fun. 


I mean there's like 5 major platforms now and that's all everyone uses. You see the same thing everywhere too. 


The internet was more about exploration, now it's all about spoon-fed consumption. You're not encouraged to seek things out, you're encouraged to let it come to you. </div>
