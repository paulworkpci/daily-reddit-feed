The following submission statement was provided by /u/TommyShelbyPFB:

---

&gt;*By the end of 2023, NASA had a newly appointed Director of UAP Research and a raft of recommendations from the independent UAP Study Team it had commissioned to advise NASA on how to use its assets to study UAP.*

&gt;*What outcomes did this wealth of UAP assets produce in 2024? So far as we know, very little of consequence*

&gt;***According to Mike Gold, the position was vacated a year later and remains vacant.***

&gt;*As a member of the UAP Study Team, he helped author the following set of recommendations that were included in the final report:* ***NASA should actively seek more comprehensive UAP data; crowdsource UAP data from contemporary sightings via a cell phone app or other means; improve FAA reporting by making it truly anonymous; calibrate NASA satellites, telescopes and sensors to study UAP; do data processing and data mining for UAP evidence in NASA’s archives; create an analytic framework that defines the background “haystack” in order to find the anomalous “needle” of UAP.***

&gt;*I asked Gold if he was aware of any progress on any of those objectives that's been made in the year since the report was released. He replied,* ***“Relative to the recommendations being implemented, I haven't seen that yet.”***

NASA announced this big UFO study as a show of transparency to the public. [Refused to look at any classified data](https://youtu.be/IGo-zQssvhc?t=3240). Refused to release any meaningful data from their archives. Refused to implement any of the recommendations from their own study. And then quietly reassigned the people involved.

Yeah this really helped with the transparency guys.

One that tempts you every time you open it to buy another wildly expensive MacBook or 2-in-1 tablet/laptop hybrid or (God forbid) a Chromebook? Before you pull that trigger, might I suggest that with a wee bit of tinkering, and maybe like $100 (less if you can find an e-waste place to salvage parts from), you can get that old clunky thing up to speed for pretty much anything except gaming? 

Here's what you need

                        <div class="comment-body">I installed Ubuntu on my grandmother's old laptop -- which was probably roughly in the middle of entry level and midrange when she got it and that was probably around 2008-2010.

Pretty sure it has DDR3 (and only 3GB of it) and I really doubt it has an SSD.  But with a lightweight OS, it does most things quickly enough.

This is my DD for anything I can't use my work laptop for (ie when I need to install software or use just about any kind of USB storage).

  
\[edit\] lately I've been using it with OBS Studio to convert some old VHS tapes to mp4 and it's done great and I've been using ffmpeg to split the files up and it pretty much does it as fast as I can type out the command line commands :)</div>

2. Surround yourself with people who are in your corner, not people who chastise you for things you struggle with.
3. Find a job that is urgent, interesting, and compelling vocationally. Those three things will help you move past executive dysfunction more than jobs where you’re critically under stimulated.
4. Sleep. Prioritize it. Take magnesium before bed and maybe move your workouts before bed too, whatever helps you tucker yourself out.
5. Meditation. Guided or not. Find a way to give yourself the time to harness your thoughts in a peaceful space where you feel safe.
6. Gratitude practice. Looking back over the past 24 hrs look back on the good shit, even when the world feels like it’s crashing down. 

Find 1 thing that you’re happy you saw, you heard, smelled, tasted, felt, and 1 thing that made your heart happy.
7. Reiterated at the end here in case you skipped down here first: give yourself grace. You’re going to mess up, but the fact that you want to get better and that you want to try means you most likely will with time.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I worked in Republican politics for 15 years, and was the first employee in a startup that I ended up running and becoming a partner in managing the staff of over 30 people. I stayed through the entire first Trump term despite openly loathing Trump, and then when covid had us all working from home, a switch flipped in my brain and I realized I didn't want to go back. I kept working remotely, openly a Democrat by then, and it never really caused any friction between me and a majority Republican staff because I wasn't an asshole about it, and I had done good work in hiring other non-assholes. Despite there being virtually no strife, I still just stopped feeling it was worth working on something I didn't believe in, especially after we had far surpassed my goals in building the company up. So I left my high paying job with generous benefits, to go into a semi-retirement despite still being in my late 30s. I have to stay somewhat involved to keep up my partner shares, but we're talking maybe a dozen hours a month of remote work on average. 

Point being, it's wild to me how many people live the lie until they gaslight themselves into completely changing who they are instead of staying true to who they are. Yes it has cost me money and power, but my life has been much more enjoyable.  It reminds me of the great Vonnegut quote: “We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.”

I wonder how many people each day wake up realizing for the first time just how many friends and family members they've cut out of their lives due to blind adherence to an ideology and the apparent comfort that comes from an ever shrinking bubble.</div>

1. An actually principled person wouldnt want ANY billionaire influencing presidents. To only criticize the other side for doing it means you lack integrity almost entitely and are a partisan hack of the highest order.

2. Trump is president, not Kamala, and he is isnt attempting to hide the insane reach Elon has in our government. You dont get to "whatabout" that shit away. Republicans won the white house and this is how they are running it. You have to own that and not be a little bitch and deflect.

Joe is Fox News for those without cable TV at this point.</div>

                <div class="post-content">The media is totally silent as over 1,000 tractors stormed London today as farmers protested the disastrous 20% inheritance tax on agricultural assets over £1M.

The Labour government is pushing policies that could wipe out family farms, forcing them to sell land just to pay taxes. Meanwhile, politicians refuse to meet farm leaders.

150,000+ people have signed a petition against this tax.

                                <div class="reply-body">The issue at hand is that if they can't pay the tax, the government takes their lands. In order to pay the tax, you must have liquid assets. Most farmers' wealth IS their land. Meaning that even though their total wealth is in the millions, they don't have millions to spend.

The inheritance tax is basically a backdoor land grab.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I don't want to overwhelm you with the many things you need to understand about combating this and improving.

I'd limit the scope of what you're trying to solve, start very small, pick one small part of your day where you can get through it without checking your phone, even if it's for 20 minutes, and then slowly build on to that.

For example, if you watch a show, go for a walk, or hang out with friends, set a timer for 20 minutes where you engage in those activities without checking your phone.

It's really important to pick small wins you can achieve and slowly retrain your attention, emotional regulation, and capacity to deal with less stimulation.

Chances are phone usage is helping you in many ways and trying to quit cold turkey is going to result in guaranteed failure, so please be very careful about that temptation.

Abstract rules are only as strong as the desire to respect them, that's why most of them fail unless they're cultivated very carefully and mindfully.</div>

Take out your phone when you are at work. 

You brain: see it as a glass jar you need to fill up every day. You need to put big marbles, small marbles and sand in it. 

Your phone is sand. If you start with the sand, you cannot get the marbles in anymore. Marbles are actual projects and work you need to do. Sand gets your dopamine system running without doing anything.

Pennies should have been nixed like two decades ago.  They’re more a handout to the zinc industry and coin blank markets to the tune of 20-40 million USD in zinc purchases per year (no idea how much in blanks) than anything else at this point.  

Honestly, I’d be down to get rid of nickels and dimes too.  I only carried quarters when I used to deliver pizza; I would just round in the customer’s favor if anyone asked for coin change.  They almost never did, which was why I was so willing to do so.  


But this is the kind of thing that should be discussed ahead of time and phased in.  In addition, Congress has been the branch to determine coinage (part of why the penny still exists unfortunately).  I agree with the outcome but do not like the further concentration of power into the executive.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;We stopped making it when it had more buying power than a nickel does today for being not with the cost of making.

That's understating it. Based on the [USBLS's Inflation Calculator](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm) a half-penny in 1913 would be worth 16 cents today, but the half-penny was discontinued in 1857.  
  
It's likely that half-cent coin had more buying power than a quarter does today.</div>

They were talking about how all great writers steal their ideas from other writers and there are never any new ideas in writing. People were praising that like it's genius wisdom. Then someone comes in saying that's what AI does and writers hate AI and the subreddit wasn't having any of that. Lots of twisting themselves in knots for why it's okay for humans to do that, but not AI.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This sub is so much bad energy, i keep thinking I need to unsubscribe and then forget. 

I think I wanted a positive/encouraging sub celebrating a more mindful, intentional lifestyle that you are in control of yourself instead of being controlled by big tech. I'm still a tech enthusiast, but how about ebooks and an ipod instead of instagram and spotify? Stuff like that.  And people could cheer each other on in living differently and setting a good example for those around us.

I realized that I'm the wrong demographic for this sub. I dislike the current social media slave culture and wanted to find my people who choose to largely live outside of it, and instead this just seemed geared towards those are completely stuck even if they dislike it. And I mean, people are here precisely because they know how much it sucks and I'd guess you get pretty negative from living in a manner you actually hate.

I guess it's kind of like if you beat a drug addiction, a rehab probably isn't the best place to hang around even though you all share a mindset of wanting to be sober. I see people saying stuff like "can you even survive without instagram?" and it reminds me of thinking that i can't live without certain self-destructive substances. I get that it really and truly feels that like you can't live without... but it's still horrifying to see someone in that condition (i realize this is maybe 95% of people with social media though).</div>

&gt; 

Ha ME TOO! I'm unsubscribing now. I need more stuff that inspires me to get offline, not ragebait. 

I'm going to try to do more of the challenges in /r/offlineday - it's a quiet sub but those may actually help me out.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">yeah fair, people just end up leaning into their doom and gloom too much. I badly fumbled my internet usage before yesterday and then managed to spend the entire next day reading through an entire book, a feat that I haven't accomplished before for \~8 years. There's bad, there's good. But reddit is just another feed, and it's easy to lean into it, into what feeds it.  

  
The rehab center analogy is very apt. I wonder if there is a better place, or if it too would just end up being a timesink... I suppose you must already have seen them but Reject Convenience has really good videos about healthier digital lifestyle, including switching to things like dumbphones. Maybe his forum is a better space for you?</div>

The offer is undervalued and clearly aimed at blocking Sama's own even more undervalued 40B offer to take openai for profit.

It takes a very very concerted effort to not get sucked into the bullshit when you hop online. Its a challenge worth taking on to change your habits and way you utilize the internet. 

We've been thrown to the wolves so the rich can get richer. I don't know how to feel about people fully sucked in and can't recognize they're being manipulated and taken advantage of, robbing them of their critical thinking skills and actual beliefs and values. Dark times. Godspeed.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There was a good thread from a lawyer on X about this that I bookmarked:

https://x.com/RenzTom/status/1887038847629877714?t=XSedEK0k5ZduJUCs7Uu8qA&amp;s=19

He explains a lot of what you posted with images of the executive order and other sources and gives a good legal context to how this was created. I highly recommend it. It's a bit long and the images add a lot of context with sources so I think it's better to just link it than copy and paste it here. 

But if you'd rather a copy and paste without images, here you are:

&gt;I inherently do not trust the media so I decided to look into DOGE myself and see what is under the hood. Initially I was quite concerned about the legality of a “new agency” created by executive order but that - just like everything else - is a lie put out by the mainstream.

&gt;To understand anything the government does it’s usually best to start with the law or something else I might be able to sue over… in this case the executive order itself was the thing to see.

&gt;As you can see this document is barely 2 pages and certainly not written in legalise. While not a complicated read - the plan was brilliant. Trump did NOT actually create a new agency. Instead what he did was repurpose an existing agency - the USDS - into something more useful.

&gt;The USDS was an Obamacare office created to make government software better. They were essentially software development for the bureaucracy. Trump renamed the United States Digital Service (USDS) the United States DOGE Service which even kept the acronym the same. Not only did repurposing an appropriate existing department allow Trump to ensure there was funding for DOGE without having to fight with Congress - he also ensured its legality.

&gt;You see Trump has power to set priorities for Executive branch departments but there are limits. In the case of DOGE, Trump clearly had a team of lawyers looking at ways to accomplish this goal legally. 

&gt;USDS was already there and funded for the specific purpose. 44 USCS Chapter 36 is the law that facilitates much of USDS. It is generally about developing tech for the government. This means that focusing on efficiency and evaluating the entire government through the lens of the IT that runs it is not really substantially altering the agency - just its focus.

&gt;At the same time Trump also wanted to bring in @elonmusk (and at the time @VivekGRamaswamy) and his team for an initial major audit/clean sweep. To do this Trump referenced another law 5 USC 3161. This law governs the creation of and staffing for what is known as a “temporary organization” in the government. This group will focus on pushing the DOGE agenda and will exist for 18 months (though their work will survive). By including this group as temporary, Trump dodged several potential lawsuits as he may not have been able to create his own new administrative entity on a permanent basis without Congressional approval.

&gt;Trump also ordered that DOGE teams be hired in every administrative branch agency. These teams are to include a team lead, a lawyer, an HR person, and an engineer. These teams work for USDS (DOGE) but work with and within various agencies. While all this is part of a “software modernization initiative,” looking at the software and how things are managed is a great way to find out where there is waste - particularly when part of the mandate is to ensure efficiency.

&gt;The last part of the post is the all important boilerplate. Trump orders all agencies to support the DOGE initiative, disclaims any other prior EOs that could interfere with this order, and makes a conflict of laws statement. This was further insulation to make this harder for political opponents to fight in court.

&gt;Last point. I don’t like that this has to be done and think the executive branch has far more authority than they should. That said, this order was very well done and Trump and Musk have really done a good job strategically here. Here’s to hoping these guys follow through on the MAGA/MAHA mandate that we the people have given and do everything possible to ensure the American people have the best future imaginable for our kids.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don't think many people thought Musk's DOGE was much of an issue until they started claiming they had the power to unilaterally reduce the size of other federal departments. 

There's a very important distinction here – federal agencies and departments established by congress are bound by different rules than ones created through executive power. A department like the state department is bound by congressional oversight, and thus requires congressional approval to be changed. This is _not_ the case for agencies created through executive means. 

The other important distinction is that departments and agencies established by congress can be granted unique authorities – something which is unique to the legislative branch. Agencies established by the executive branch on the other hand have to abide by normal laws and often serve advisory roles. They definitely do not have the authority to change the structure of other federal departments, in any way shape or form. This is true no matter what president established them, and Obama did not use the USDS for that purpose.

While it sounds nitpicky, this is why people are saying it's a constitutional crisis, not because it was Trump that did it.</div>
