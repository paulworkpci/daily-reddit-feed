Are you getting proper nutrition and water intake daily? 

Excercising regularly? 

Start with those things at the minimal and see if the brain fog clears up. 

For not having friends - try volunteering for something for a few hours on the weekends. It’ll get you introduced to new people as it’s important to exercise that social muscle too. 

The exercise and volunteering will boost your self confidence and allow you to accept yourself as you are instead of question why you’re the way you are, which is very important to move forward from here.

Also would suggest to take an MBTI personality test to understand yourself and your brain better.</div>

He's already said "GPT-5 in a few months" on Feb 12th. So they're using the o3 and o4 release as a stopgap so they can delay GPT-5 for another couple months.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Gillibrand:

-An avid supporter of Kirkpatrick

-Did not see a conflict of interest with Kirkpatrick’s professional background

-Did not see a conflict of interest with AARO sitting in the DOD

-Did not attend Grusch’s classified testimony to the SSCI

-Did not attend Grusch’s public testimony on Jul 26th ‘23

-Continued to say Kirkpatrick was incredibly capable following LinkedIn outburst

-Pushed for Grusch to meet with Kirkpatrick

-Lamented Kirkpatrick stepping down

-Is more focused on shooting down UAP than following a trail of breadcrumbs to craft in contractor hangars and unravelling the biggest conspiracy in human history

Matt next time you speak to Gillibrand can you ask her why she does not see a conflict of interest with AARO sitting inside a federal dept implicated in covering up legacy crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">For everyone seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with manufacturing returning to the US, there are two issues with that

  
1) The cost to create factories costs billions. And they'd have to be up and running within 2 years. The problem is, that entire investment goes down the drain if Trump decides to lift the tariffs on a whim like he has already multiple times to Canada/China/Mexico. Who wants to commit to building factories/warehouses at a cost of billions when a new administration that doesn't believe in tariffs or Trump changing his mind wipes it all out? This is a fantasy and will never happen

2) Who is going to work at these factories? We can't even get people to work minimum wage jobs at fast food restaurants. The reason we buy items from Asia is because their workers make it at about $2/day wages. That isn't remotely possible in the US even with how anti-union Trump &amp; Elon are. You can get rid of unions but ain't no one working for $5/hr, which means they'll look to automation, and how is that bringing back jobs in the US?

Free trade has lots of faults. But this tariff bullshit is definitely not the answer.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If this was really about bringing back manufacturing they would’ve released a plan to enact these tariffs in 1 or 2 years. With a phased approach to ease the pain and ensure time for industries to react. 

The tariffs would be targeted at certain sectors and counties to have the most impact and least disruption.

Their approach seems designed to inflict maximum harm immediately, with minimal benefit. 

You can’t bring back good manufacturing jobs if all the raw materials used in production are being taxed to death. And even if some businesses managed to source all their materials from the US and have the facilities here they are now locked out of all foreign markets.

The US has spent decades becoming a service powerhouse. Our workers have been developed to thrive in this economy. Now we’re going to switch overnight to become the world’s factory again?</div>

Really sounds like learn to code rhetoric but from right wing economist instead of neoliberal.

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly. Several republican congressmen and women have been expressing this exact sentiment. Targeted tariffs on a small amount of strategic goods from specific countries that do not import them at significant quantities can be very useful as we saw the Biden administration do last May:

https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-biden-administrations-targeted-strategic-tariffs-are-effective-industrial-policy-at-work/

With tariffs on a smaller amount of imported goods you don’t run the risk of raising inflation. If you tax penguins, for example, the inverse is true.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Also, here's the thing... Bernie made it clear how he planned to help workers and regular people. He promoted Medicare4All and a better health insurance system. He talks about maternity and paternity leave for new parents, which in principal even the right should want -- Elon wants smart, hard-working young people to have babies, right?  Bernie talked about encouraging higher wages via a minimum wage that isn't $7.25 an hour. He talked about new energy technologies and using those to bring jobs here and make us independent of oil. You can disagree with him... I personally think nuclear is a viable option for the future, while Bernie opposes it.

**Bernie's tariffs would have been part of an overhaul plan to fix healthcare and get people paid more fairly.**

What are Trump's other policies to go along with the tariffs? DOGE outlined roughly 250k layoffs of various workers, including scientists, and cuts to research at NIH, NASA, and NIST. He has promised to kick out and deport immigrants. Maybe some waste will be cut and tax dollars will be saved... but what is the plan for those saved dollars? Likely more tax cuts for the rich. Our 401k's are plummeting, but we have social security... which Trump and DOGE are trying to gut, kneecapping Americans in both knees, and in the nuts too if they invested a chunk of money the past three months. Again, where is the help for regular Americans? As it stands, we're looking at mass layoffs and the destruction of both social safety net programs for the elderly.</div>

Driving becomes really enjoyable when every red light, slow driver in front, or diversion doesn't matter because you're ahead of time.

And if you get there without any delays, the extra 15 minutes will fly by, and you're not stressing about being late</div>

Millennials know how to operate a computer the best (on average) because we grew up when it was harder.

Does it matter, not really. Gen z didn’t learn a lot of the nitty gritty because they didn’t need to. Young kids today won’t need to know nearly as much as gen z do either.

Step Two - Redorder them in order of importance.

Step Three - Do them.

Just like the US ignored raising the minimum wage since 2009 we are going to ignore the destruction of humans earning potential given advances in AI &amp; humanoid robotics.

This is something that needs to be talked about and figured out now, not 10 years from now after there is massive human pain and suffering.</div>

But life can get better \*on average\* if you put the screen down and make changes to your environment. internet causes depression -&gt; use internet more to cope with depression -&gt; stagnation

I try to think of it this way. Quitting the internet won't change your life but quitting (or cutting back) will give you a lot of your time and power back to change it yourself.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Start from the very bottom at USA and go all the way up to the top. It’s a Y shape. That’s for Family Y. 

Those are the Illuminati bloodline families mentioned in Ancient Bloodlines Contemporary Power. They’re ancient Iranian/Aryan tribes that have essentially controlled the world from behind the scenes since recorded history. 

These are families like the Rothschild, Orsini, Aldobrondini, Chigi, etc. Many of them are Popes, Presidents and other Heads of State, leaders of Central Banks, Top Military Leaders, etc.

They control both sides of every conflict as you can see in the graphic. They control all the banking, shipping, warfare, essentially everything. Regular people do the labor and they get their cut.

As for the 2 sides, they are actually working together and they get others to fight the wars against each other, while they profit and then rule over whatever is left.

Throughout history there are different Gods who they worship, but one side is always Dark and the Other is Light. At the bottom, the left side is Lucifer (Light) and the right side is Satan (Dark).

Make sense so far?

Travel up the Y and you see the different Light vs Dark factions of each time period. Each side represented by different God’s for that time period. 

Duality.

That’s why you see the black and white Masonic checkerboard. That represents Dark vs Light.

The ones at the top of the pyramid so to speak are farmers/shepherds in a sense.

For example: Big Tech and all stocks are crashing right now. It’s a harvest for them. 

Allow me to explain. All of the engineers who built and coded the software and AI programs, the people who built the chips, the people that worked to earn money to invest in these companies, are all being harvested for their energy/time right now. 

They will buy up more shares for cheaper, and many of you will hold the bag.

This is them yolking or harvesting you like a crop or cattle. You can use a cow/bull to pull a trough and till the land, milk them, or slaughter them for meat.

Now apply this to countries/societies.

Some countries have Capitalism, Socialism, Communism, etc. 

These systems are designed to control millions of people/cattle/Human Resources.

They will decide what wars will be fought, regular people will fight the wars and cull each other, then they will end the wars and create new treaties or countries or religious institutions and rule over that land and those people.

Think of it in terms of farming. They are farming you in different ways using these different systems of control such as economy (Capitalism, Socialism, etc), religious, social standing, etc.

China used to be full blown Communist, now it’s kind of a hybrid of Communist and partial Capitalism.

But think about what happened when China became freer? They have mass amounts of slave labor building everything we buy pretty much. Look at their working conditions. Not so free are they?

Now go to the United States. The supposedly wealthiest nation in the world. 70% of people are divorced, most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, most Americans are unhealthy and most Americans work the majority of their lives, yet they don’t own anything of significance.

Furthermore, look at the illegal immigrants flooded into the US. It’s not because Democrats want to give them a better life, it’s because they are usually coming from extreme poverty and they are easy to manipulate and control. Plus they can send in bad people on purpose who will cause chaos, and then they create new laws based upon that.

Order out of chaos. 

Create the problem and create the solution.

Now analyze everything that I have said so far, and apply it to modern times and go all around the world.

Then go back to the map and work your way up and back through each historical period.

The same playbook is used throughout history.

You get to the top before the Y splits at the Tribe of Dan section. That’s the Canaanites. They are the bloodlines talked about in Ancient Bloodlines Contemporary Power and they are controlling both sides of all conflict.

The reason why we have all these different systems is about control like I said.

For example: if China or the US falls, you still have all of the other countries/economies farming along.

Furthermore, people who have been in power for a while tend to get lazy and weak, then they get destroyed and a new Empire rise.

The collapsed Empire will eventually rebound, but it will take generations.

Think of that in terms of farming again.

If the entire world is one big farm, each country is essentially a different part of that farm and each population is the farm animals to be culled or harvested. 

This is where war comes in (population control, changing of political or economic systems in that country region), economic crashes (they harvest your work building up the companies or technologies, etc and harvest your time by crashing the markets to buy it back cheaper. This is what the Rothschilds did during the Napoleonic wars to England. Same with Covid), disease/famine (population control, new medications to make money off, etc.)

Just go through each section of the map above and research the different time periods and see who benefits from each war, disaster, market crash, etc.

This is the hidden hand that runs the world.

It’s a complex system of control used to rule over billions of people from the shadows by divide and conquer and getting the worker bees to cull themselves while they get the honey.

Hopefully this will explain about the map above and also explain how the world really works.

We’re basically the cattle on a big farm planet/prison planet except the only fence keeping us on the plantation is a the illusion illustrated by the control systems that I explained above. The so called Matrix so to speak</div>
