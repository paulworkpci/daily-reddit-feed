                <div class="post-content">Hey everyone, Nick from Cline here.   
  
just a heads up there's a new free coding model available called code-supernova. Completely free during alpha, no usage limits, 200k context window, and accepts images. 

Apparently, it's "designed for agentic coding harnesses", like Cline.

You can access it through Cline provider (\`cline:cline/code-supernova\`).  
  
Let us know what you think of it!

It’s over. Idk about you, but I hope you can at least hold MAGA accountable: they started this, they used it as a political tool and then they fell in line when their dear leader became implicated. I hope no one ever takes the bullshit they say seriously ever again. They don’t deserve any credibility. That’s gonna be about all you’re gonna be able to do about it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">TLDR; You aren't going to compete or collaborate with ASI.

Let's say companies competing against each other in the future with ASI is like a Chess tournament today with AI participants.

If you have groups of super human AI challenging each other as a team and inside one of these teams, there is Magnus Carlsen (the best human chess player in the world) making decisions. The team with Magnus Carlsen in it will lose after playing enough tournament, because he is significantly worse at chess compared to the best AI systems of today.

If you are a human working in a company and making decisions with ASIs as your team mates and your competition is companies with only ASIs, the company with only ASI employees is going to be more competitive and destroy the companies with humans in it.

Not only will you take worse decisions than ASI as a human, and you'll be way more expensive, but also ASI will be capable to collaborate and communicate with each other at a speed of pages of text communication in a second. while you'll think and communicate at regular human speed.

Despite what sam altman says, you aren't going to compete with ASI, all jobs will be essentially gone, and you won't even collaborate with ASI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is such a lazy statement though. If ASI is defined as being better at you at literally everything, then yes, you obviously won't be able to compete with it at anything.

How is this stating anything new? 
There is no risk in this statement.

Will we reach this definition of super intelligence anytime soon is another question, with much more risk in the predictions. 
I doubt we will reach this definition as part of purely digital/artificial anytime soon, and I strongly believe that a merge/hive mind/superorganism enabled by AI, is more likely to be the fastest way to this definition of super intelligence. And thus you will become part of the super intelligence, not seperate from it.. And no, you cannot compete with it, the same way an ant cannot compete with its colony.</div>

Most of the spending 'for the metaverse' was for device development and research, and they have absolute market dominance in VR/AR with their headsets. Other vendors are a rounding error compared to what number units Meta sold.</div>

At some point, we will be able to locally run 400B models + COT, and the difference in quality will be negligible.

Maybe being 'The Google' of AI means better targeted ads based on prompts.</div>

EDIT: It's been pointed out in the comments (with sass) that minifying your JSON is another, perhaps even better, alternative than transforming to YAML. So now there's two options for saving tokens. </div>

&gt; Nevertheless, the existing all-electric model range is being continuously updated. With the Taycan, Macan, Cayenne and the **future two-door sports car in the 718 segment, there will be an attractive BEV offering.**

Now the question is will they re-release the 718 GT4/Spyder after making it regulation compliant.

I've driven the Macan at a Porsche event at a track, they had us autocross it, the handling is pretty good. (I realize that it could be considered a lifted hatchback). My understanding of the Macan is that AWD is standard and the power is biased to the rear.</div>

Doesn't Audi's Q7/Q8 use an AWD system that is "FWD until it sense it needs AWD?'

That's how the Quattro system was explained to me, once, at least on newer models.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Philosophical Stoicism says the same thing. It’s hard to fully appreciate, however (at least for me), because lacking certain things in the modern world makes it difficult to just be happy as is. I mean, if a person is broke, or has unstable housing, or has physical or emotional issues which make it difficult to work, it’s almost a natural consequence for that person to be unhappy. Sure, he could just go live under a freeway overpass and eat wild berries and collect rainwater to drink and be happy or content, but how practical and/or attainable would that be really?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I've tried isolating myself to meditate, I was miserable.

I talked to a senior monk who does solo cave retreats, he does not like them one bit. He saw it as necessary to further develop his mind. 

I think we as humans do have certain conditions under which we thrive most. Isolation is not one of them, and that's pretty obvious. Yeah you can probably train the mind, but it's not natural at all, and probably quite harmful. 

So i've come to dislike all these simple internal vs external claims. Life is complicated, human psychology is complicated, it's never all that simple. 

Plenty of monks who 'train hard' are miserable.  
Only a few really thrive in a monastic setting. 

I hate one liners like 'happiness starts with you'</div>

Makes me fucking sick. Come tell me how Kimmel getting the axe, for saying literally fucking nothing btw you fucking snowflakes, but kilmeade saying to literally just kill homeless people only has to fake apologize, tell me that's the America you want to live in, and back it up with how that situation is totally correct. Do it.

Instead, I bet all I'll get for responses from you weak willed pieces of shit will unfunny snarky comments about how I'm butthurt or some shit. No actual argument about how this isn't a blatant disgusting violation of constitutional rights. Just "cry more" esque, "violate my rights daddy trump" pedophile loving bullshit.

EDIT: You know what? I am actually fucking butthurt, buttfurious in fact, that not only is this orange child rapist getting away with blatantly violating our constitutional rights, (yes, one Americans rights being raped like the children on the island absolutely equals all of our rights being raped) he managed to brainwash half the fucking country into celebrating him using our constitution as his personal cum sock when hes done with his paid for children. You should all be fucking ashamed of yourselves.

Allow me to add one more question that won't be honestly answered: if Obama or biden manipulated their way into taking anyone on Fox News off the air for speaking badly about them, would you have celebrated that as well?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think spec-driven development is great, but both spec kit and BMAD are pretty useless by themselves. I've taken inspiration from these and others in my own spec templates by iterating through many specs and for each spec iterating the templates and improving them. I think the general principle of a three template system works well. The WHAT (spec int speckit) template, the HOW template (plan in speckit) and finally the TASK list. Another project using the three template system is [https://github.com/Pimzino/spec-workflow-mcp](https://github.com/Pimzino/spec-workflow-mcp), it has interesting ideas, but like the others is not very useful it itself.

I would suggest actually as a start just use the template from spec-kit, then if you are using Claude Code or Codex Cli just refer to them using "@plan-template" etc and tune the template to fit your workflow. One thing that I personally found useful is to make the spec template less structured and include a reference to a narrative freeform template in addition to the more structured form. I made some vibe-coded scripts for verifying that it hasn't forgotten to make any of the plans or any of the tasks, but found that I haven't needed it that much actually. 

[https://github.com/github/spec-kit/tree/main/templates](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/tree/main/templates)

The guide to spec-driven development from spec-kit is also a decent intro to the general concept.

[https://github.com/github/spec-kit/blob/main/spec-driven.md](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/blob/main/spec-driven.md)

TLDR; Don't use a framework. Just use prompt templates for WHAT to build, HOW to build it and what TASKS should be done.</div>

I think some of what Kiro and the spec-kit do need some structure and disciple around it.  Maybe it’s more of an enterprise solution with workflow or feeding Jira into the specify, or the tasks into Jira etc</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I've used spec kit. It's really cool at first. Then you start using it some more and realize that it makes all this fluff around the project really well but when it comes to making the actual project it falls very flat. 

It's easy to get blinded by that shiny lining wrapped around and woven through the code.

Ultimately, it appears to actually complicate things too much for the model. It ends up with too many tasks and gets distracted on things that aren't as meaningful as we would think. It may be partially due to an unintentional obfuscation of tokens through heavy context. Or in other words it's doing so much on one thing that it 'forgets' or doesn't see the more important things. Or it could also be like an attempt to break down a large project into steps which is different than creating steps and having it execute each step all at once.</div>
