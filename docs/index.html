I'm an atheist, so I'm not interested in the spiritual or religious side of meditation — just the practical, secular aspects of the practice.  
Any recommendations for books that take this kind of pragmatic approach?

Thanks in advance.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I would suggest the following:

- Wait until the day you'd walk out anyway, but would be open to longer
- Politely give them two weeks notice
- Watch them fire you on the spot
- Qualify for unemployment
- Tell all the coworkers you like what happened so nice people don't give two weeks' notice thinking it means anything

Of course, they might not fire you, so you should be okay with the idea of another two weeks, but if nothing else this is a nice experiment on behalf of your other coworkers you like.

Update to clarify: re: qualifying for unemployment or whether this counts as wrongful termination, you should check based on which country or US state you're in.  I am not a lawyer.  But there are absolutely places where this is correct, and places where it's incorrect.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Bulletpoint 4 is wrong. Once you submitted your intent to resign your employer can simply accept that resignation effective immediately and it will still be considered voluntary separation. There may be a bit more nuance in some of the more employee-friendly states but in general this is still considered a resignation and won’t qualify for unemployment. 

Some employers will elect to pay you for those 2 weeks simply out of good faith, but again most places don’t require it.</div>

You are hurting all of your co-workers who will be forced to cover your shifts and they will remember it. 

If in the future they happen to be working where you are applying, it won't go well for you. They could quite possibly be the reason you don't get a future job.

It is a cliche but the world really is a small place and you'd be surprised how often you wind up working with former co-workers.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hi, Kilian from the SWE-bench team here.

We just finished running GPT-5, GPT-5-mini and GPT-5-nano on SWE-bench verified (yes, that's the one with the funny openai bar chart) using a minimal agent (literally implemented in 100 lines).

Here's the big bar chart: **GPT-5 does fine, but Opus 4 is still a bit better. But where GPT-5 really shines is the cost. If you're fine with giving up some 5%pts of  performance and use GPT-5-mini, you spend only 1/5th of what you spend with the other models!**

                                <div class="reply-body">Money, blackmail, extortion, leverage.

People who run for public office are often of a certain personality set. Among their traits is usually ambition.

Ambition is a trait that is much like greed. Ambition can be bought. It can be leveraged. It can be compromised. It can be utilized. 

Ambition is a weakness. Where there is as weakness, there is an ability to “hack”. 

Some people in office are evil and have dark pasts. Some have vices. Some have career-ending faux paux in their personal files. 

I believe Israel has perfected the ability of digging into people to find their vulnerabilities so that they can hack and control people. 

But I think there are also some people who are in politics that are in it for the love of the game. There are people like this scattered throughout upper management and elite circles. People who just had a solid drive, luck and circumstances that helped them get to the top. These people aren’t that vulnerable - but their weakness is that they’re isolated and alone. And Israel has the power to turn the people the overwhelming # of drones they *do* control, against them at any time. 


Godspeed Massie. And Ilhan Omar. And Rashida Tlaib. I’m even hoping for the best for MTG. 

Because, as someone who has more left side views on politics and society, AOC is a disappointment. As is Bernie Sanders. And liberals and democrats in Congress are an absolute joke. They’re losers. They’re a disaster. They fucking SUCK. </div>

As soon as it turns out that their leader is almost certainly on the list, suddenly they don't care about it anymore.

Im absolutely flabbergasted, how are these people real. Do they not have a single critical thinking brain cell in their heads.</div>

But it’s pretty obvious that there is solid evidence that implicates Trump to Epstein abuse of underage girls. And that this collection of evidence (aka “the list”) is what he is hiding.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Extremely disappointed with the weight. I saw the 12.2 second 1/4 miles and it was below my expectations of a sub 12 second time based on how damn fast the ram 1500 with the HO engine are. 4800lbs.... Yikes

Edit: I know it has AWD standard. If I remember correctly, I originally heard this new platform is lighter than last gen. This engine weighs around the same or less than a 392 is my guess. So I was thinking it would come in around 4300 with rwd and 4500 with awd.

I'm guessing the extra weight comes from the fancier interior packaging, liftback tailgate (!!), AWD, LSD, big brakes, big wheels, etc. I think all of which comes standard on both R/T and Scat Pack trims.

Sofyan from Redline Reviews mentioned Dodge claimed 3700lbs and 0-60 in 3.9 seconds. Honestly, Dodge is sand bagging the numbers to save face with the EV Daytona. Sofyan previously tested a RAM 1500 Limited HO Hurricane that weighed 5900lbs and it did 0-60 in 4.1 seconds. Caranddriver got 4.2 0-60 and 12.8 in the 1/4 mile with the same car!

This new Sixpack Charger is 100% running 0-60 in 3.5 seconds and 11s in the 1/4 mile if Dodge offers the absurd 3000-4000rpm launch control like in the RAM trucks. I'm excited again. Usually dodge is optimisitic with numbers. It has forged internals and stuff so it will be cool to see how well it does against the S58 and B58. For 55K it's a great price too but it needs an aftermarket exhaust.

At the end of the day it's the same size as a S class which weighs the same with a turbo 6 mild hybrid and AWD but no liftgate. Seems like the platform is not really overweight.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">$52k for 420 hp is high since for 10% more money you can get 550hp. I don't know who would buy the 420hp version. That will probably be discounted quickly. 


They should also bring back the base V6 model if they actually want to sell a decent volume of cars. </div>

That would tell you she got what she wanted and maybe more.

That was going to end poorly for Mickey.</div>

I'm not a layer, but my understanding of the law is that if Carano's team had found any indication of impropriety or dishonesty on the part of Disney regarding this situation in any of those emails, then the judge could rule that the facts of the case be interpreted in a manner that favors Carano... and we all know Disney's been up to fuck shit since their inception. Certainly explains why she's "smiling."</div>

Granted, on some people a big expense triggers the "sunk cost fallacy" that pushes them to continue. (Example: I already bought a Peloton, might as well use it instead of renewing my gym membership).


But if you have a history of doing that and it not working...then yeah, the trigger wasn't good enough and it's best to find other ways to motivate yourself.</div>

I love Claude models, but "parallel test-time compute" they used to achieve 80% on SWE-bench is not just thinking. More on that here:

[https://www.anthropic.com/news/visible-extended-thinking](https://www.anthropic.com/news/visible-extended-thinking)

\&gt; sampling multiple independent thought processes and selecting the best one without knowing the true answer ahead of time

That's not what Claude models normally do, it was a research experiment.</div>

Now he is finding out that he isn’t part of the group, and the actual tech oligarchy is eating him alive.

The only thing I dislike about Demis the child chess prodigy is that every time he's interviewed he starts out with how he was a child chess prodigy. Which to be honest if I was a GM at 12 years old as a child chess prodigy I would probably mention being a child chess prodigy too.</div>

But out of all of these people Demis seems like the one with the best moral compass. 

But again, comparing to people like Elon or Altman that's not a particularly high bar :)</div>

A tweet like this, in times like this, gives me a grounded feel and makes me like Demis even more.  
It's the quiet kid in class getting A+ on every test, but says nothing.  
I've always had huge respect for those kind of people.</div>

I don’t think I have to speak for myself when I say that each model was useful for a specific use-case, (the entire logic behind multiple models with varying capabilities). Essentially splitting your workflow into multiple agents with specific tasks. 

Personally, 4o was used for creativity &amp; emergent ideas, o3 was used for pure logic, o3-Pro for deep research, 4.5 for writing, an...</div>

They have been subsidizing each signup in order to gain the market share and get the hype. That's the silicon valley model. It's worked to a certain extent. ChatGPT is pretty much synonymous with this tech in the same way that google is synonymous with internet search. What they haven't done is actually pivot into a profitable model like airbnb or uber. 

You can always move to using the API interface. You can still choose the model and pay for the exact amount of usage. They don't bar anybody from racking up a $400 monthly bill.</div>

However I'm more privy to think scaling hit its upper S-curve.  The 5 base model is probably "stronger" in terms of parameter count and compute than any of the 4-class models, but after a certain point, diminishing returns took their toll 

Hence why 4.5 was disappointing. 5 arguably more so. Raw attention-based transformer scaling isn't going to yield much greater returns. 

I've been expecting that a neurosymbolic language model with internal tree search (to solve the fundamental issue of the latent space being completely scattered and activating the closest expected token rather than actually understanding anything) could be the next real step.

That said the API models show that the web / app version that people are querying is **GPT-5-chat**, not GPT-5.

In the guidelines they list them as equivalents:
* o3 -&gt; GPT-5 medium
* GPT 4.1 -&gt; GPT-5 minimal or low
* o4-mini / GPT 4.1 mini -&gt; GPT-5 mini
* GPT 4.1 nano: GPT-5 nano

I’m not sure where GPT-5-chat falls on that table, bht the calls to GPT-5 take way longer than GPT-5-chat. 

GPT-5 and GPT-5-chat are the same price though ($1.25 input / $10.00 output), but GPT-5 is the higher reasoning model.

I haven’t tested GPT-5 reasoning effort levels (minimal, low, medium, high) vs GPT-5-chat, only the default "medium”. 

Maybe someone has ?

It *looks* like my GPT-5-mini responses also take longer than -chat, though I haven’t run enough to be 100% sure. It’s way cheaper ($0.25 input / $2.00 output) and seems about on par with GPT-5-chat reasoning wise.

GPT-5-nano is fastest and cheapest but no JSON, and lowest performance by far.</div>

Yes, I know they are the ones who published the groundbreaking paper on LLMs but that didn't translate to consumer products on their end. If OpenAI fails they will become complacent and raise prices even more and will not innovate.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not really, gpt-5 is the first one thats autorouting replies - differences in performance between best and worst possible response from gpt-5 are far greater than between responses from e.g. gemini 2.5 pro. 

Gemini 2.5 pro is basically giving every reply compute budget x. Openai is giving every reply a compute budget from x\*0.1 to 10\*x, based on perceived difficulty, current utilization, etc. But for the leaderboard, they are routing all respones to 10x budget. As capabilities scale significantly with compute at inference, thats skewing the results and kind of gaming the system.</div>

Especially when they want this model to have mass adoption from the non-AI savvy. They shouldn’t have it using a base model that trash and call it GPT-5 for any prompt</div>
