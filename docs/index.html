&gt;"I have owned my 2025 Lucid Air Touring for nearly six months now, and have put about 3,400 miles on it. Unfortunately, these miles have seen numerous hardware failures, an abundance of software glitches/bugs, and have been accompanied by frustrating software design choices. In this video we'll break down all the problems I've had with the most expensive car I've ever owned."</div>

Sounds like if you’re that excited about the hardware you have to mentally push the software risk to the side and lease it so you’re not stuck with it forevermore.  It’s also kinda horrific/amusing that today vehicles are shit on and develop a terrible reputation from hardware failures but as we move to EVs companies will be known more so for their software practices.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Actually the software sucks in most of the cars from the past 20 years too, people have just dealt with it since there hasn't been a great experience to compare it to. Portable tech, like phones, laptops and tablets, have become commonplace and much more refined and we now compare all tech to that experience. That's setting the bar for all industries and most others still don't view themselves as software companies. Hardware companies can rarely think life born and bred software companies.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The thing that makes me crazy is that EVs are potentially DRAMATICALLY simpler and more reliable than ICE vehicles. But almost NO ONE is leaning into that potential; they're piling on the pointless untested mechanical, electronic, and software gewgaws.

Have the idiots designing popup door handles and self-driving BS EVER left Southern California? There are actually places where the water turns to stone December-March, y'all...

Yes, you need some fairly sophisticated computer controls and sensors under the skin to manage the motors, batteries, etc. and get the most out of an EV, sure. But all you need is basic software in a sealed box that mostly minds its own damn business and runs the vehicle.

The one current exception might be the Rivian vans they're making for Amazon (and just starting to trickle out to other fleets). They're all about low TCO, and they're quite simple, with pretty much invisible software. With a focus on low TCO over all, commercial EVs are probably where we'll finally see some of the potential of simplicity realized.

The Slate and Telo small pickups seem to lean in this direction as well. Although they're still in the "test mule" phase, but it's clear that the focus is on high utility and low cost (and hopefully the associated durability) and not on $5,000 networked perineum massagers and internet connected tail lights that brick the car when they fail.</div>

havent tried it yet cause we're bootstrapped lol. but the strategy is pretty obvious

theyre going after the same market as cursor, copilot, claude code. except instead of competing on features theyre just making it free

smart move honestly. startups are price sensitive. why pay $20-40/month per dev when amazon gives it free

the catch is after that year expires. classic freemium pla...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I've tried the 20$ ChatGPT subscription and I found that it was wildly insufficient for me -- I would run out of weekly quota after a day or two and have to wait 5 days to use it again. The Claude 20$ subscription gave me more bang for my buck -- I was able to go 3 to 4 days before running out of weekly quota. I then switched to the 100$ Claude subscription and that allowed me to work straight out without stopping. When free Antigravity came out, I cancelled my Claude subscription because I was able to use Antigravity to get the job done, but I think I still prefer Claude Code. Also, I tried to use Antigravity a couple of days ago and kept getting error messages because the Antigravity servers were overloaded by too many requests.

Back in September, I also tried Warp.dev, they used to be really affordable but now they are wildly overpriced, I do not recommend, but it allowed me to test a huge range of LLMs. In particular, I tested GLM 4.6. Unfortunately, the open-source LLMs like GLM are completely unable to do my work so I can't use them.</div>

At the beginning you’re looking down, your eyes should be up and looking ahead the whole time. Find a spot on the wall to stare at

When you extend on the 3rd pull the bar is super far away from you. Try bringing your elbows up and think about lifting your shirt with the bar. Practicing high pulls just with a pvc or empty barbell will help a lot!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You'll get much much better feedback in the weightlifting sub, but fundamentally with the snatch your goal is to use your legs to generate explosive force to drive the bar UP.

think drive - shrug - sit

Right now you're instead banging the bar with your hips to loop it out and over, which works for lighter weights (and you'll see a LOT of crossfitters do a similar style in WODs) but will limit you at higher weights.</div>
