\- Nothing was open sourced, research was hardly shared  
\- They did not release multi-modality quick enough  
\- Code quality was bad/no frameworks for model development (it's been said multiple times from OAI insiders that most code is just cobbled together)  
\- Too little real-world testing and too restricted models</div>

&gt;Scientific progress is a collective effort. We believe that we'll most effectively advance humanity's understanding of AI by collaborating with the wider community of researchers and builders. We plan to frequently publish technical blog posts, papers, and code. We think sharing our work will not only benefit the public, but also improve our own research culture.

Hopefully, another open-source player is joining the game?</div>

I noticed this in my behavior: 

When I do things that give quick/easy dopamine, it is harder to do the more challenging/rewarding tasks.

My brain is smart. It wants to do the least amount of "work" for the most "pleasure".

After scrolling on my phone for an hour, do you think I feel motivated to workout? NO! My brain got some cheap dopamine and doesn't want to workout.

                                <div class="reply-body">Try to redirect to healthier sources. When you notice yourself picking up your phone or even if you find yourself on hour 3 of scrolling all of a sudden, make the conscious decision to pick up something else to keep your hands busy, even if just for a bit. Keep notebooks handy to doodle or write in, try to learn to knit or crochet, clip your finger or toenails, make a cup of tea. If you have a pet then play or give them scritches or a treat. It takes practice to be able to just set your phone down and walk away from it, but it works and it’s worth the effort. If you absolutely need some brain noise then clean while listening to a podcast or watch some good ol’ tv.

Instead of trying to force yourself to stop all at once, you could start by making small, manageable changes. For example, set a timer for ‘intentional breaks’ where you scroll for 5-10 minutes, then gradually shorten it. 

Beating yourself up over it often makes the cycle worse, so maybe frame it as 'I’m improving my focus' instead of 'I have to stop this bad habit.' It’s all about small wins!</div>

It doesn't mean the information isn't helpful for someone else. Or perhaps, it's presented in a different way that is helpful.

The main question is, are you taking steps to make progress instead of coming across the same type of information? Maybe intentionally research something on your phone for 15 minutes that'll help you develop more skills or upgrade your career?

                        <div class="comment-body">On October 25, 1988 Shirley Temple exposed Hollywood pedophilia on CNN’s “Larry King Live.” Temple shared her experience with a naked producer at MGM when she was 12-years-old.

Temple said that she was separated from her mother at MGM and went into the office of Louis B. Mayer, and into the office of Arthur Freed about being given a role for a movie, Temple alleged that Freed was naked when she entered his office.

If you review some of Shirley Temple’s old footage today, it is disturbing to say the least.</div>

Also the way that she speaks about this just seems like a strongminded person who's been able to stave off permanent trauma from that episode (and I presume many others); it could be that she's very good at repressing it, but it just feels to me like she's processed and accepted it. I love that she went on Larry King and put them on blast, by name, including the guy that (likely) tried to SA her mother (how many in the upper-eschelon would have the inclination or the guts?). Also impressed that she made it through her career so unscathed, which again must have taken some serious resilience. We're talking about one of the biggest child stars who ever lived, and perhaps the *first* one, with no blueprint to follow or expectations whatsoever of the pitfalls—which, we know now, are exceedingly dark and rampant. Elvis, a grown-ass man, found himself in the same kind of situation with his first-rockstar-level national stardom. He couldn't handle it. Personally, I don't think that's the result of a weak character; I think 99% of people would have found themselves in the throes of that same outcome. That should tell you something about Shirley Temple. New found respect and admiration for her.</div>

You read post after post of people diagnosing and complaining about the world's problems, intellectualizing mediocrity, and making every setback into some grand systemic failure instead of just getting their shit together.

                        <div class="comment-body">I've been reading "Chatter" by Ethan Kross and it really put some things into perspective!

Before social media, when you felt distress and wanted to talk to someone about it, you had to wait for someone to be available. That gives your mind some emotional space from whatever event triggered your distress and once you do talk about it, you're able to do so in a more positive and productive way.

Now we can spout all of our distress immediately and publically and that can be a bad thing. Reading someone else's distressed ramblings can actually damage the mental health of both the reader and writer, it "darkens" your internal monologue.

Reddit is a perfect example of this. People run to subs to immediately ask for advice in a situation instead of working through some of those bad feelings first. People reading the post can literally *feel* the negativity and often will respond negatively in turn, fueling the OP's distress.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is a bad habit of mine.

When I feel upset, I come here.

However, over my years of doomscrolling I've found out what doesn't work.

Depressed people need to be careful when joining communities of other depressed people. Because confirmation bias can be poisonous in certain doses.

In group therapy it's balanced out because everyone vents, there is a supervisor, they sometimes wind down, and then you leave and go about your day.

With Reddit groups while there are mods it's rare they'll post in the threads. So it'll be like "I'm so depressed DAE feel depressed?" and because they are in a community of depressed people the answer will always be "yes". And when it's not then the feeling is "well I'm not feeling good, go somewhere else". And sometimes depending on the crowd you'll get tons of comments talking about how much they hate life and how much they want to do not living things.

I'm not saying the spaces shouldn't exist. But rather venting can gradually turn into self reenforcing behavior. And yes I'm speaking from personal experience. I go on and off on leaving the subs because after a point it feels like I'm harming myself for no reason.

I feel like the Internet sometimes feels like a big group venting session, but there's no positive takeaway. It's always "everything sucks, it's getting worse, and there's nothing you can do about it".

Even here sometimes I feel afraid to post because is it really productive to say "new internet bad, old internet better"? But I think we talk about it because we do want it to get better on some level.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm not surprised his audience is moving on, I was an avid listener since late 2010. Listened to almost every single podcast up until about a year ago. It's not even political for me in the slightest, the last couple years especially he just has been having less and less interesting podcasts.

 The move to Texas really took a hit on his guests for sure. Over the last 3+ years him constantly bringing up the same talking points from one guest to the next has just gotten worse and worse. Also, he talks about himself far more now than he used to years ago, which we've all heard every story a million times... 

On top of that you have every guest singing his praises like he's some sort of messiah almost every show and that always turns into a giant suck-off/time-suck of Rogan pretending to just be a humble comedian giving back to comedians blah, blah, blah and the "ya know, I never started this podcast to make money" speech, etc...

He's increasingly become more and more out of touch and intellectually trapped in the insular golden cage he himself has created.

I typically only listen to one podcast of his a week now, if that, because I know the same talking points will just be regurgitated throughout the other shows.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's crazy to think he used to talk about psychedelics and their effect on consciousness, socialized medicine, universal basic income, marijuana legalization, and awesome astronomy stuff on a regular basis, and now he still cant get over covid lockdowns (during Trump's term no less...), trans people, and issues related to homelessness. 

Like obviously we have complex issues to deal with and progressives in certain areas failed to handle them well, but promoting a wannabe dictator is not the answer. And if people think I'm being hyperbolic here, Trump openly declared [it's impossible for him to be charged](https://www.salon.com/2025/02/15/he-saves-his-country-does-not-any-law-denies-his-actions-are-unconstitutional/) with breaking the law, and today that "presidents decide the law" in an executive order. It goes against over two centuries of judicial president and the most basic ideas of how the constitution works, but I expect Alito and Thomas to rubber stamp it anyway.</div>

But, them simply saying other sources are illegitimate doesn't do much for people who don't believe him unless he is able to punish and shut down the ones he considers illegitimate.  Trying to do that, however, is a violation of the first amendment. So, he would need to get the first amendment nullified first.</div>

He is quite well known. Anyone who works remotely in AI knows him. 

Why is the in the news as much as Musk/Altman? 

He probably doesn't try to be in the news as much. He seems to be more humble tbh. 

Also, he works at google. And google is massive and has its own capital to fund it's AI. 

Altman and Musk on the other hand, have their own businesses and need to be out in the news a lot more so that they can get funding.</div>

Atomic bombs, biological weapons, chemical weapons. Either from that data somehow leaking into the training dataset, or extrapolating from known physics/chemistry/biology. So far, their models aren't smart enough to tell you how to cause mass destruction, even if you get past the guardrails. 

At some point, we will have models that have the knowledge of how to cause mass destruction. At that point, do you want anybody in the world to have access to that information? Should I be able to look up the recipe for Novichok? Or Sarin?

Letting the companies police themselves would be dangerous too. That's why he's advocating for strong independent regulators. On the same level as the IAEA and the UN.</div>

Why is open source AGI safe?



Edit: 

People like to talk about open weights models increasing safety. That is not an accurate reflection of reality.

whenever a model gets released /r/LocalLLaMA goes to work making sure that uncensored versions of the model exist and are spread around: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/search/?q=+uncensored&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;sort=top

This is existence proof that open weights versions of models are more unsafe than ones that are not shared.

AI's that are more capable are more dangerous by definition. At some point this is going to become a real problem. 


Continuing to share models as capabilities increase is like doing BSL4 tests in public with ever more virulent pathogens and hoping that nothing bad will happen. "well, the previous pathogen just caused a common cold, therefore the future more advanced pathogen is going to be safe" 

'one simple trick' could stand between us and the internet being toast and global supply chains disrupted.               
Someone finds a way to improve capabilities, taking something from an arxiv paper and fine tuning a current open weights model, out pops an agent with a drive to replicate and has top notch coding and hacking skills. Rip internet.</div>

Perplexity is already using questionable sources sometimes, using republican garbage as sources, they kiss the ring and are compromised on all their models anyway.

I implore you all to really check what sources are being used when you search anything even slightly political.</div>

NASA has many High-resolution Photos of UFOs or Alien Spacecraft! 

See the testimony of a former NASA employee!

The NASA Photos of the Moon Were Airbrushed l Donna Hare Top Secret Clearance NASA Contractor

Donna Hare had a secret clearance while working for Nasa contractor, Philco Ford. She testifies that she was shown a photo of a picture with a distinct UFO. Her colleague explained that it was his job to airbrush such evidence of UFOs out of photographs before they were released to the public. She also heard information from other Johnson Space Center employees that some astronauts had seen extraterrestrial craft and that when some of them wanted to speak out about this, they were threatened.

                        <div class="comment-body">I find it unlikely, mainly because there is no expectation for NASA to release a picture from a series of images. If one contains a UFO, remove it from the pile. There is no need to airbrush it out - thus exposing the picture to even more people who have to remove it. It's not like NASA is taking singular images on missions.

More likely there was a team touching up photos and occasionally something strange might have been in-frame that was not noted prior.

I do however, see a scenario where NASA accidentally photographed military satellites and such of which would have been classified. When asking "What is this object in this frame" the answer is "Sorry that's classified but please airbrush it out for public release". e.g. we don't want the public and our adversaries to see it.

Doesn't necessarily mean "UFO" per se.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; I do however, see a scenario where NASA accidentally photographed military satellites and such of which would have been classified. When asking "What is this object in this frame" the answer is "Sorry that's classified but please airbrush it out for public release". e.g. we don't want the public and our adversaries to see it.
&gt; 
&gt; Doesn't necessarily mean "UFO" per se.

I think that's how a LOT of this UFO lore gets going.  Most people don't realize how much hardware the US has in space that has never been revealed or photographed.</div>

a satellite doesn't leave a shadow on the ground like she said.

Also how do you explain the guy being knocked in the head.

Lastly other people have talked about this NASA photoshoping before so the data converges.</div>

He asks chatGPT what to do, tries to do that and usually fails... and then he expects us to fix his problems for him, when his approach is not even sensible. If I explain to him why his idea will not work, he just says: "Yes, it will", thinking a chat prompt he generated makes him more qualified than us more senior colleagues.  
Just running chatGPT and blindly trying to emulate everything it spits out does not really make you qualify for a masters degree, when you don't even understand the basics of a topic, sorry.

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean, the only benchmark that matters is the real world. 

Why is it that after GitHub copilot released over 3 years ago, insane progress if you measure that with benchmarks, and many pronouncements of “everything is going to change” am I busier than ever as a dev? Why is software really not being built significantly faster or cheaper than 5 years ago? Someone wanting to honestly evaluate the impact this technology will have should care about these questions.</div>

Managers spend a lot of time doing things like: monitoring performance and code velocity, planning out roadmaps, discussing with different teams and summarizing important information that needs to be communicated to other orgs… 

These are things LLMs are good at. You could hook an LLM up to the codebase and have it summarize every day “here’s who’s doing a lot of work and here’s who isn’t”</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Guys please help me understand. I am using o1 Pro ($200/mo) and Canvas to make a very simple text-based game in python. 600 lines of code. There's no physics, and really not much in terms of game play. In fact, the player literally holds one button the whole time.  But despite the preposterous simplicity, every time I make a small iterative change, o1 Pro breaks the code in some other apparently unrelated place, forcing me to have to go back, time and again, to fix it back the way it was. I mean, it will just randomly delete definitions, events, write broken bits of code over top of functioning code, etc. etc.  And then I'll have to show it the error text and it will try to fix it and break something else. Admittedly, I'm not much of a coder. But isn't o1 supposed to be the equivalent of a world-class coder?  What am I missing here? Has anyone else experienced this frustration?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Now you see why those benchmarks don't translate to reality. 

Competitive coding is usually very short programs. In a real enterprise application you will have millions of lines of code and engineers need to know (or figure out) which part of that 1,000,000 lines of code need to be edited to add the new feature you want. 

Custom built tools combined with AI (Like GitHub Copilot or Cursor) are much better but they still don't get near to the level of world-class engineer.</div>

it happened the last time because no lab was releasing their models, and the public saw like 3-5 years of progress in AI all at once.

These days there's a new model dropping every month.

these days it's gonna be like:

1: AI can't even attempt this problem

2: AI can sometimes do this in a way that isn't completely garbage

3: AI can assist you at doing this but you need to do the heavy lifting

4: AI does this but you need to check it for correctness

and stage 4 would last for a really really long time as the long tail of edge cases AI learns goes to zero

  
It would be slow; frog in boiling water. we won't notice it's happened until we look back.</div>
