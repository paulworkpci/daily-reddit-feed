Pretty impressed! GPT-5's analysis actually helped Claude Code solve a couple really tricky problems where I was completely stuck with Opus 4.1.

Was using Gemini CLI with 2.5 Pro before for second opinions. Now, I've asked Opus to compare both tools on the same code reviews and bug analysis tasks. GPT-5 gets 7...10/10, Gemini only 4...7/10.

Codex CLI is fairly solid though. I still have not narrowed down exactly what I will use it for, as I still find Claude Code the top. But it is nice to now have Codex and Qwen-Code as two other viable options now.</div>

I tried Opus 4.1 (with Max toogle) in Cursor and didn’t  see much difference with Sonnet 4. Maybe Opus in Claude Cursor is more capable ,  not sure it’s $160 extra more capable though.

About $160 extra :) Well, Claude Code is generally just really good at agent work. I use Sonnet so rarely that it's hard for me to say how much stronger Opus is. The point of the $100 and $200 plans isn't that it's more powerful than the $20 one, but that I work 10+ hours a day with Opus and rarely hit the limits. With $100, this happened constantly. According to ccusage data, I spend about $200-300 of tokens per day. So it's the same Opus, just with much higher limits for all day work.</div>

Its hard to communicate what this feels like without having tried it yourself. But what I can say is that it truly feels insane. 

Imagine combining this with voice, drawings, images. Soon, we will literally be able to look at our application and tell it what we want. And see it instantly come to life. Not in days, not in minutes, but in seconds.

                                <div class="reply-body">Just vibecoded an enterprise user story extraction tool to supabase. GPT5 created the  schema, permission settings and deployed, all i had to do was outline what i wanted, provide the api keys and then review. Much cheaper and quicker than delegating to an intermediate developer. Anyone who can’t get a production ready output with today’s tools either needs to up their skills with the tools or software development itself. 

For reference I did 90% of this between meetings, and saved what would likely cost $200,000 in man hours for my company over the course of a month.</div>

Also you get more for that


Also we need to know how many $20 vs pro accounts. 


If it's 20:1 then that means the plus accounts keep the lights on </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's the same for all others. Claude Sonnet 3.5 was very promising at natural-sounding writing/language/translation tasks, but it got visibly worse and worse from 3.5 to 3.7, and 3.7 to 4, because it became more and more coding-focused.

I understand that they prioritise who funds them, but if LLMs are going to be ultra-smart code assistants, then they should stop creating a hype like they're going to save humanity. Enjoy your coding tool, but just be honest and don't advertise it like it's for everyone.

Besides the financial reasons, I also think that since they're coders, they're living in their own bubble. That's why they think they're making their models smarter in a general sense, while all they do is making them better coding tools. All those bold claims they come up with, like how their next model will have PhD-level intelligence or how we'll have Nobel Prize winner intelligence in a few years... They have no idea how human intelligence works. I studied Cognitive Science which is interdisciplinary, and it provides a wider and more realistic view on AI. From computing perspective only, it's easy to think that if you just make computers smarter, you'll have a digital Einstein.</div>

Even things like when the republicans refused to vote on Obamas Supreme Court pick for a year until he was out of office so they could install a conservative judge. That’s just one example. Republicans gave up decorum and FairPlay quite a while ago to move into the zone of “fuck you, we’re taking what we want.” They have enough public support to do it. There is a point where they would not have enough public support to do it, but they are so good at manipulating the media and public opinion that I don’t know if we’ll ever get there.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Discipline comes from motivation, which comes from desire. Yes, desire is one of the three poisons and you can't get rid of it (only your attachment to it). Once clarity is polished, the desires become more pure - the desire to live the dharma. That is how I understand it.  

Edit - Sorry for the Buddhist flavored answer, I thought I was on a different sub.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not a Buddhist either, but this closely matches my experience. Meditated for years and it was always a struggle to practice regularly and at length. Then a year ago I got cancer. Suddenly the clarity, urgency, and discipline was there, for free. What a gift! I won't say that meditation is effortless now, but it is certainly the best part of my day, 1h early morning and 1h early evening, every day, no excuses.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">What is a lack of discipline? 

It’s wanting something without having to sacrifice the something else. It’s a wishy-washy approach towards satisfying nothing, because you try to have everything.</div>

He was an acquaintance via my daughter in day-care at the time (dad of her friend). They were moving, but couldn't get anyone to help so he asked, as a long-shot, if I could come. I did.

Turns out he's an avid gamer like me, so we have literally had sleep-overs to play retro console games or have LANs. Also taught me disc golf.

So, yes. This tip works.</div>

Asking a favor just seems like an imposition and I know I can figure it out myself, even if it takes 10 times longer.

If it's something quick like lifting a 200lb 16ft pressure treated 2*12 onto the roof of my SUV, I will do that. Longer more complicated tasks, I just try to figure it out myself.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Certainly not terrible, but since you asked ... 

Hips came up first, robbing you of power.  Makes you a bit slow in the middle, and that's what led to the miss on the first attempt. 

You need more commitment with those elbows.  You're waiting to make sure you can receive it before committing to throw those elbows through.  But if you just say "fuck it" and drive those elbows through just as you finish your full extension, you'll be able to lever yourself under the bar with lots more speed.  Work on that and you'll catch it cleaner and lower and will be able to pull larger loads. Lots of high pull and turnover drills should help with that.

Focus on strengthening your front squat.  Do lots of paused and bottom up work.  Get more confident driving from the bottom and you'll have less hesitation dropping under a heavy bar.

Happy lifting!

Good luck and happy lifting.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think it’s common because most people don’t teach to “dive and pull yourself under” the bar. Most people only think about receiving in that high top position. 

I do feel like squat cleans help teach the pull under the bar. I’d say practice from high hang, mid knee, then the floor. They’ll learn how to handle the stress by relying on technique better.</div>

I watched the first two on video and kinda said to myself “Just get under the damn bar!”  So I think it’s a good call to work on those drills you mentioned. The last one on front squats I didn’t think of but I can also see why that would be super helpful.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">YMMV. If you got the frames and/or lenses from a particular spot, adjustments are often free, usually for a year or two. If you walk into a place you have no connection with, it may be a liability issue where they wouldn't want to adjust, because of warranties and all.

Can't speak to getting new nose pads as I have plastic frames, but a new case may cost money. Again, depends on the place.</div>

Cities’ power grids are so weak that some companies are just building their own power plants rather than relying on existing grids.

Most of the infrastructure in the west is still based on all the stuff we build in the 50s and 60s. And a lot of that infrastructure never got the proper investment needed for maintenance.

Not only that, China can produce nearly all of the products and inputs for maintaining infrastructure domestically, while the US needs to import a lot of it. Ironically much of it from China directly, or passing through China at some point in the production cycle.</div>

The problem is you need to get folks to stop shitting themselves over windmills, solar panels, and nuclear being built near them. The biggest impediment is that an HOA might organize a sit-in at a random city hall and browbeat the zoning board into killing the project because Margaret doesn't want those bird-killing windmills near her.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s as much permitting and imminent domain litigation as cost (although they are obviously interrelated). In the U.S. we hold property right sacrosanct, so some farmers can hold things up for years in litigation. China culturally has much less emphasis on property rights so they just plow right over whatever land they need. It’s no different than building high speed rail or housing. 

China is about the collective and thinking in decades, the U.S. is all about the individual and thinking short-term. It’s no surprise this is how things would go. Unless and until there is the political wherewithal for something akin to the new deal, we’re going to fall behind.</div>

She wanted people's opinions on the whole fiasco and also a perspective on the emotional connection to AI. I wrote her a pretty interesting letter following our conversation. I think the world should tear OpenAI apart so they don't allow themselves to do something like that again. This is not about abolishing the model, but about transparency and trust. If they said they had to do something, justify it and offered an alternative? Maybe even at the cost of raising prices and lowering limits? I would be pissed, but it would settle down after a while. But Altman is full of shit and lies.</div>

But to be truly useful, models shouldn’t just beat humans on a benchmark — they also need to be faster and cheaper.  
  
That’s why raw benchmark scores alone shouldn’t be the main focus anymore; speed and cost matter at least as much.

It was clear to anyone looking at charts with price in them that GPT-5 was great in terms of price to performance, but they focused too much on selling it as "the most powerful model" instead

Not to mention the dumb graph crimes. How do they not have someone revising the presentation for what was supposed to be their biggest release since GPT-4?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agree in general. GPT-5 is also faster though, so it looks like they genuinely did manage to bring the price down on their end. The GPT-5 release seemed like it was about consolidation, speed, and price saving. The fact that they did this while still pushing benchmarks and being right on trend with METR is impressive.

People were expecting something much bigger and unrealistic. (They also believed hype from Sam.) 

  
My guess is that they are now managing to make a good profit on inference, but what is difficult to estimate is the cost of research and training runs.</div>
