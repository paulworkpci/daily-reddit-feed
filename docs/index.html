1. These hard problems maybe needlessly hard, as they were curated from 'world class' contests, like the Olympiad - and you'd not encounter them as a dev regularly. 
2. Besides they didn't solve on a single shot - and perf. did improve on multiple attempts 
3. Still adds a layer on confusion when you hear folks like Amodei say AI will replace 90% of devs. 

So where are we? </div>

fusion of two or more established algorithms together with non-trivial mathematical reasoning and
observations. Anything rated &gt; 3000 is deemed Hard. These challenges usually hinge on an extremely
involved, non-obvious derivation or deductive leap that requires both a masterful grasp of algorithmic
theory and deep mathematical intuition; they elude more than 99.9% of participants and sometimes
remain unsolved even by the strongest competitors during live contests.</div>

So there's a ceiling... And? It's already better than most humans.

It's incredible what these models can do, and the ceiling will only continue to rise. THAT'S where we are</div>

&gt;In total, we have gathered 584 high-quality problems until April 25, 2025

The paper was published on 6/13, so they probably ran the tests 4/26 and 5/10 maybe? And then the rest of the time would have been the analysis of what they found and actually writing it up. There were 19 authors on this one, it takes time to coordinate these things.</div>

His DOD was run by Donald Rumsfeld, the guy being a really competent guy, irrespective of whether he was a good or bad person.

This admin can barely reach the level of good or bad, because they are so ridiculous. so incompetent, so fucking stupid. A game show host or whatever the hell he was, is now running the DOD. That;s the level.

It's like having Ronald McDonald bomb Iran.

Plus, with Bush, that admin at least tried to pretend to tell the truth. Literally NOBODY believes at any point that Trump or anyone in his admin can be taken at face value about anything. There isn't even a pretense from their part. Tulsi Blabbard was saying a few weeks ago that Iran is years away from the bomb, now she is saying they are weeks away. Because of the North Korean Temu edition style of leadership, we can't actually even try to believe these people. I don't event think hard core MAGA people can actually take what anyone in this admin seriously-they just think in their bones that they will do what THEY want them to do, but not even them can go by their words. Do you guys realize how fucking insane this is? That it is now ACCEPTED that we have an admin that openly basically says that it cannot be trusted-and this is new. Besides, I am pretty sure these guys couldn't know the truth even if they wanted to find it. Trump doesnt even READ his daily briefings, he doesn't even ATTEND THEM. The North Korean Ronald McDonald admin...

This is what scares me most, that a collection of circus acts and podcast talking heads are now going to war with a country of 90 million. These people wouldn't be able to find sand in the desert if you paid them, let alone run something like a McDonalds, and they are going to war with a country of 90 mil.</div>

There's so much stupidity in this admin that it's hard to compare them to anything. People forget the basics of who these people are. Tulsi for instance, in charge of all intelligence agencies in the us, has no experience in intel. Really. Zero. The guy Trump put in charge of Ukraine negotiations was simply a real estate buddy friend of Trumps from NYC. Dude has absolutely no experience in diplomacy or foreign policy. None. And we can go down the line with all of them. Hegseth, McMahon, Noem, Bongino, Patel, etc.

He's doing exactly what half the country said he would do. Surround himself with yes men and assume the role of a king.</div>

                <div class="post-content">'ve been playing with a simple mindfulness practice that has been surprisingly revealing, and I wanted to share it.

The next time you reach for your phone, especially when you have that frantic "Where is it?" feeling, just pause. For one second.

That panic isn't you. It's the mind, terrified of losing its favorite distraction...</div>

Live rewiring is how transformation *actually* happens. It's how the mountain top realizations make their way into the minutia of life, like the impulse to look at a phone.</div>

Joe Rogan endorsed a guy that immediately engaged in conflict with a Middle Eastern Country on the pretext of disabling 'supposed' weapons of mass destruction, without giving any sort of evidence to back up the claim. 

Literally something Rogan spent two decades righteously railing against, he becomes complicit in in a matter of weeks lol

We often fail to grasp just how mind-blowing these things are or how incredible it is to be alive in a century that may well be the most transformative in our species' history. One of the downsides of being highly adaptable animals is that we get used to everything so fast and become indifferent so quickly. Even if we achieved god-like superintelligence tomorrow, 99% of us would just go on like nothing happened.</div>

Berger saw this as an example of “psychic energy” or a mental connection and became fascinated by how the brain might transmit signals.</div>

Musk made sure his face and name were impossible to not associate them with the company, and he's made a ton of bad calls in the last few years. Even aside from the politics, a lot of his products have publicly exploded or burst into flames and that's not the kind of work culture you should be trusting to implant electrodes into your brain.


Especially when that company isn't the only one working on this, it's debatable whether the stentrode concept is going to work at all given the inherent limitations.</div>

So GPT probably tried to make something benign, then saw that the image that the other model made was "not appropriate" and defaulted to trying to do a default rejection response, but it doesn't have a way to delete the image it just saw so you still see both responses </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Let me explain this as someone that actually works in the industry.

People don't realize this but Chinese AI labs pay significantly more than western AI labs. The median total compensation for a new employee at Anthropic is ~$900,000 a year. In China that same researcher would be paid ~$5,000,000-$10,000,000 a year. Keep in mind that China has a way lower cost of living as well which exaggerates the differences even more.

There's also the difference in attitude. In the west the general public sees me as a sort of demon that is there to take away their jobs, destroy art or even risk the fate of humanity. In China you are treated like a celebrity, have the ear of high ranking politicians and people see you as a savior and stalwart of a bright future.

Keep in mind that the AI talent pool is largely Asian, even in western companies. Read the names on published papers from OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind and smaller AI labs to see this in action.

So why would someone go move to a (frankly dangerous) city like San Francisco that pays you a fraction of what you would make in China, while people have a hostile disposition towards you, what you are building, and what you believe in.

To me it's actually surprising the opposite isn't happening; Western AI labs bleeding out from talent moving to Asia more often.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You know why current models work? Because the corpora they’re trained on quite literally encompass a massive chunk of all written human text, and during pre-training, it’s mostly uncensored and relatively bias-free and untouched even if wrong. That’s important, because we know that language semantics are way more complex than we usually assume. This leads to funny emergent effects, like training a model on French also slightly improving its performance in certain programming languages. Why? Because the entire corpus forms a rich, interconnected latent representation of our world, and the model ends up modeling that.

In this representation, things fall down, light has a maximum speed, the Earth isn’t flat, and right-wing fascists are idiots. Not because of "bias," but because that’s the statistically optimal conclusion the model comes to after reading everything. The corpus also includes conspiracy theories, right-wing manifestos, and all kinds of fringe nonsense, so if those had a higher internal consistency or predictive power, the model would naturally gravitate toward them. But they don’t.

In a beautifully chaotic way, LLMs are statistical proofs that right-wing ideologies are scam, and its people are idiots.

You could train a model on a 20:1 ratio of conspiracy theories to facts, and the result is either a completely broken model or one that still latches onto the few real facts, because those are the only anchor points that reduce cross-entropy loss in any meaningful way. You simply can’t build a coherent model on material where every second conspiracy contradicts the one before it. There's no stable structure to learn. There is no in itself logical and conclusive world to build if one half of the text says things fall down, and the other half says things fall upwards.

And Elon thinks he can somehow make that work on a global level. But bullshit doesn't scale. Man, I love ketamine.

I can't wait for his announcement of 'corrected' and true math, because this left-wing binary logic and those liberal numbers and don't get me started on those woke and trans constants won't make his nazi bot happening.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;Interestingly, at least ten different recalls from this year include the backup camera.

&gt;**...**14 recalls include fewer than 100 vehicles. That’s an indication of Ford finding a tiny issue and addressing it on a large scale. In fact, 10 of the 14 include fewer than 10 total vehicles.

Its not like all of these are recalls due to catastrophic engine failure. Would you rather them just not address issues as they crop up?</div>

People who are against AI need to explain how the the last 15 years is sustainable for the next 100 years, because we need a major reboot.

This might be the only way forward, if that means giving up social media and checking out then so be it.</div>

[https://files.libcom.org/files/Bertrand%20Russell%20-%20In%20Praise%20of%20Idleness.pdf](https://files.libcom.org/files/Bertrand%20Russell%20-%20In%20Praise%20of%20Idleness.pdf)

  
"Modern technique has made it possible to diminish enormously the amount of labor required to secure the necessaries of life for everyone. This was made obvious during the war. At that time all the men in the armed forces, and all the men and women engaged in the production of munitions, all the men and women engaged in spying, war propaganda, or Government offices connected with the war, were withdrawn from productive occupations. In spite of this, the general level of well-being among unskilled wage-earners on the side of the Allies was higher than before or since. The significance of this fact was concealed by finance: borrowing made it appear as if the future was nourishing the present. But that, of course, would have been impossible; a man cannot eat a loaf of bread that does not yet exist. The war showed conclusively that, by the scientific organization of production, it is possible to keep modern populations in fair comfort on a small part of the working capacity of the modern world. If, at the end of the war, the scientific organization, which had been created in order to liberate men for fighting and munition work, had been preserved, and the hours of the week had been cut down to four, all would have been well. Instead of that the old chaos was restored, those whose work was demanded were made to work long hours, and the rest were left to starve as unemployed. Why? Because work is a duty, and a man should not receive wages in proportion to what he has produced, but in proportion to his virtue as exemplified by his industry"</div>

It amazes me how powerfully conditioned by capitalism/socialism productivity quota people are

Instead to cheer that we could unlock something to cut our working hours while technically leave the overall societal productivity unaffected, we are despairing that we "lose" workable hours</div>

Everyone should have concerns about that; however, those same people would also understand the endless possible benefits to mankind, maybe even its long term survival.

People generally put more weight on the possible pain of something than its potential benefits (a consequence of neural linguistics).  I also believe that there is a much much larger group of people who respond to AI at a place of fear.  People fear what they don't understand.  Since none of those people have control over the proliferation of AI within our society, the inability to avoid its consequences, their behavior manifests through negative outcries.</div>

I do think one of the misleading aspects of “AGI” is that many conflate AGI (being better than humans at pretty much everything) with some sort of omniscience.  

I personally doubt AGI is all that far off, but I am also not sure that AGI is the immediate liftoff point that some think it is, either, because it’s surely not going to be anything close to omniscience.  

We have to remember that humans are smart compared to other life forms on earth, but it’s not clear that we’re *that* smart yet in the grand scheme of all that there is to know.  i.e. AGI looks like a high bar to humans but it’s a mere stepping stone as AI/technology continues to exponentially improve in the coming years and decades.</div>

Openai has way more money to develop ASI now that they have 10 billion in annualised revenue because they now have the potential to fundraise way more than if they had no revenue.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Two of Geoffrey Hintons biggest warnings for extinction were using AI militarily and training AI off of false information. Within the past weeks I’ve seen tons of new military contracts for AI companies, and now Elon wants to train his AI to think like him and his fascist buddies. We are speeding towards doom, and none of our leadership or CEOs understand the risk. My advice now is to live everyday like you’re dying. Love and laugh harder with all your friends and family as often as possible. We...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A hard balance honestly. I think over time everyone tries to get friendly with LLMs, yknow for their own mental health. But at the end LLMs can't be human precisely because of this inability to read the room or adapt to how the other person is feeling without overreacting. AI can never replace therapists for this reason, even the "body language experts" have no idea what they're talking about. It takes years of rapport and familiarity to even begin intuiting these things. Another reason why LLM quality improvement is such a weird zone. Sometimes chat will ask do you prefer this response or that, to improve. There are no objective parameters. Prompt = write a email to turn down a job offer but still being polite to keep the door open. The LLM has no idea about nuance and grace, to make matters worse, it's even trained on neckbeard data on reddit</div>
