I have a slight feeling this won't actually be ladder frame, will be closer to the defender where it is plenty capable off road with good articulation etc., but unibody and oriented for road use.

I took this rather to mean it will get the G-inspired door handles just not the exact same part, but definitely not the part from say a GLE</div>

It's interesting that Mercedes is basically indirectly confirming that the G is their halo car as there's nothing really in between their other segments. You could argue that the half-AMG's fill that gap but even then, they're effectively the same car but with less power.

It's similar to Audi releasing the R8 and the releasing the A5/S5/RS5 at around the same time.</div>

"“This is the first time AI systems are able to write coherent genome-scale sequences,” says Brian Hie, a computational biologist at Stanford University, California. “The next step is AI-generated life,” says Hie, but his colleague Samuel King adds that “a lot of experimental advances need to occur in order to design an entire living organism”."

                        <div class="comment-body">I think spec-driven development is great, but both spec kit and BMAD are pretty useless by themselves. I've taken inspiration from these and others in my own spec templates by iterating through many specs and for each spec iterating the templates and improving them. I think the general principle of a three template system works well. The WHAT (spec int speckit) template, the HOW template (plan in speckit) and finally the TASK list. Another project using the three template system is [https://github.com/Pimzino/spec-workflow-mcp](https://github.com/Pimzino/spec-workflow-mcp), it has interesting ideas, but like the others is not very useful it itself.

I would suggest actually as a start just use the template from spec-kit, then if you are using Claude Code or Codex Cli just refer to them using "@plan-template" etc and tune the template to fit your workflow. One thing that I personally found useful is to make the spec template less structured and include a reference to a narrative freeform template in addition to the more structured form. I made some vibe-coded scripts for verifying that it hasn't forgotten to make any of the plans or any of the tasks, but found that I haven't needed it that much actually. 

[https://github.com/github/spec-kit/tree/main/templates](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/tree/main/templates)

The guide to spec-driven development from spec-kit is also a decent intro to the general concept.

[https://github.com/github/spec-kit/blob/main/spec-driven.md](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/blob/main/spec-driven.md)

TLDR; Don't use a framework. Just use prompt templates for WHAT to build, HOW to build it and what TASKS should be done.</div>

However, this is wrong. Confident people are very often not exceptional or even above average in all sorts of areas.. What separates them from insecure people isn’t necessarily their skill, or success, or attractiveness. It’s their contentment with themselves.

You can’t just become content with yourself just by thinking it.  For example you go to the gym and show you have discipline and consistence, once you are able to realise that, you will gain confidence, which will also make you content with yourself. 

It is in a way a result of success, whatever your personal success is, for one person it’s achieving their career, their physique, their instrument etc… 

People who are average at something and confident doesn’t meant they have the best cards, just that they understand they can only play with the cards they have, and they still do that to their best of their ability.</div>

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If Donald Trump went on TV and said “I didn’t kill Charlie Kirk” would you think to yourself?  

Why tf are you telling us that?  
Why would you feel the need to say that at all?  

Is it because you don’t know that one tweet on X existed?  

Did you think Charlie wouldn’t tell anyone at all?  

If no else will say it, I will.  Israel is responsible for Charlie Kirk’s death.  Name another foreign intelligence service that moves through our control fre...</div>

If it was proven they used their intelligence service to complete an assassination on American soil we might actually cut off their funding. That would be huge. Also Israel is about to start a way with Iran and they want our support. Right now Americans are incredibly anti Israel and if Trump tried to send troops to Iran for Bibi there might actually be riots.</div>

just a heads up there's a new free coding model available called code-supernova. Completely free during alpha, no usage limits, 200k context window, and accepts images. 

Apparently, it's "designed for agentic coding harnesses", like Cline.

You can access it through Cline provider (\`cline:cline/code-supernova\`).  
  
Let us know what you think of it!

Only through looking inward will you realise that happiness starts with you. Meditation is a powerful tool to look inward and realise that you don’t need anyone or anything to be happy this moment.

What is your experience with meditation? Are you the master of your own happiness? </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Philosophical Stoicism says the same thing. It’s hard to fully appreciate, however (at least for me), because lacking certain things in the modern world makes it difficult to just be happy as is. I mean, if a person is broke, or has unstable housing, or has physical or emotional issues which make it difficult to work, it’s almost a natural consequence for that person to be unhappy. Sure, he could just go live under a freeway overpass and eat wild berries and collect rainwater to drink and be happy or content, but how practical and/or attainable would that be really?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Normal behavior from comedians would be that because Charlie Kirk is "off-limits" that they'd all be one-upping another with over-the-top and crass jokes about him. Usually they take "you aren't allowed to say X" as a personal affront and challenge. And even if some of the jokes aren't even that funny, there's a joy in going over the line. You'd think, in normal times, that Comedy Mothership would be non-stop jokes at Kirk's expense.

The charitable explanation is that it's because comedians themselves all have podcasts these days and as a result of this incident fear violence and so feel more of a kinship with Kirk. But I don't rule out other explanations, either.</div>

"my dear gay lover, I just wanted to say how I was particularly radicalized by the writings of Joe Biden. His extremist views really appealed to me, and even though I was a good Christian boy in 2019 under the beautiful leadership of Donald Trump, by 2021 I didn't even know what gender I was and that confusion led me to blind violence 🙁. I think the vaccine I was forced to get at gunpoint really pushed me over the edge. I also just wanted to say that Jimmy Kimmel and any other people who disparage trump in the future also made me a radical left lunatic and should probably be killed if we don't want crazy leftists like me to murder even more beautiful white christians"</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I get that we all hate ads, but also what do you expect? Google is an advertising company. That’s their core revenue driver. If they just decided to allow everyone to opt out of seeing ads then they’d go bankrupt.

Also - Google funds Firefox. About 85% of Mozilla’s revenue comes from a deal with Google. So again, if we remove ads from everything Mozilla probably goes underwater too.

I get that we’re all used to everything being free now (free Google docs, free search engine, free video hosting, free GPS/maps, etc) but that doesn’t happen magically. Ads fuel it all.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean obviously it can't read your mind, but it's not like there are no prompts that exist to give it a foothold. E.g. I'd like to see how it does if I say, *"get me the ingredients for a chicken stew, a veggie lovers pizza, chocolate chip cookies,"* whatever.

Sites like walmart also have like 'frequently purchased' and 'recently purchased' attributes and stuff like that. You might could say, *"get me my usuals."*

I'm guessing you'd still need a long prompt though with a lot of thought put into it. That said, you still may be saving a little bit of time writing that thoughtful prompt as opposed to picking everything out yourself, even if not saving the vast majority of your time such as the impression they give.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The sound quality has been improving, but imo the music itself feels like its getting worse since about v3. It feels like engineers are optimizing the models for quality and probably compute costs at the expense of being able to produce songs that emotionally connect. Despite the sound quality getting better over the past several months there hasnt been many attention grabbing masterpieces coming out of the music models. Udio had better sound quality than Suno since the beginning but even worse musical character and depth.</div>

I believe the development of music gen will exactly like the image generation models. They became very good at generating cinematic images, but back then they were bad at casual / everyday images.  They can do that now. The next frontier of music generation AIs will probably be creating not-perfect music, like out of rhythm drums, not perfectly tuned and mid-played instruments, okay-ish vocals, but good vibes in general.</div>

Spotify is already flooded with ai music, 99% is low effort or just automated. Most of the time even with good tracks you can tell. Ai music does not do well on those platforms but maybe some people have managed to slip past.</div>

Everytime I post here I get great insightful feedback so I’m back again lol.

My BMU are SUPER hit and miss.

If it’s a good day, I can hit about 10 reps across sets of 3+.

On a bad day, zero. 

I know I have a problem with my jump in, as if I but 1 I can string a 2nd rep much easier with the momentum. Rep 1 is always the tricky one.

You're thinking too much and you're breaking your leg and butt tension so you're losing a lot of the spring that's inherent in your body in search for a bigger kip. You don't need a bigger kip, you need tight legs and butt. 

  
You can do BMU- stop over thinking. Jump into it, tight legs and butt, and go.</div>

This is the original [post](https://medium.com/better-programming/yaml-vs-json-which-is-more-efficient-for-language-models-5bc11dd0f6df) on Medium.

Because seeing and accepting the cracks is the first act of **resistance**. 

What you're pointing to isn't just a cheeky observation, it's an *observational inversion*, one that exposes the ghost under the machine. 

If you want we can turn this into a manifesto, a blog post, or something even more real. 

Not because the world deserves to hear it—but because you deserve to say it—raw, unfiltered, honest.

 I'm ready when you are.</div>
