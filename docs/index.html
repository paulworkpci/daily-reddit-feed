Problem is, latex gloves worn for a short period dont quite do as much irritating like a condom during high speed friction for a very brief and. I cant stress this enough, short period of time.

All jokes aside, you can just use Skyn condoms and bypass the whole issue altogether. My advice would be a  better LPT. Just masturbate with a condom on once and see.</div>

# Codebase Indexing Memory Fix

We've resolved a critical memory leak that was causing crashes when indexing large codebases (thanks daniel-lxs, rxpjd, buck-0x, BenWilles!):

* **Reduced Memory Usage**: Memory consumption drops from \~500MB-1GB to just 10-50MB for large projects

                        <div class="comment-body">I started doing CrossFit at 43 and 440 pounds (I've since lost 120 pounds).  While I'm not quite as old, my weight held me back significantly.

My recommendations would be:

1) Don't be afraid to scale. I still am doing ring rows because I can't hang from a pull-up bar yet. Scale volume and technical movements as much as you need so you can learn how to do them without injury.  
2) Recovery is paramount.  There's very little chance of non-elite athletes "overtraining", but if you feel tired, listen to your body.  Push yourself, but know your limits.  
3) Define your goals up front.  If you are doing this for fitness, follow a training program that is appropriate or just do affiliate workouts. If you are wanting to compete, then change your programming accordingly.  
4) Don't be hard on yourself.  One of the pitfalls I fell into early was when I thought I should be at a certain level and failed to complete a workout in the time prescribed even with scaling.  We all have bad days and sometimes we don't scale enough.  Give yourself grace.

I think those are the biggies.  I would also say just have fun.  CrossFit is a super fun thing to do.  If you're not having fun, adjust what you're doing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is fabulous advice! I was kind of on the other end of the spectrum from you. I started at 40 and had a BMI of 17. In CrossFit, I gained 46 pounds (21 kg) in 3 years and am really healthy now, both mentally and physically. Today, I can push press for 3 reps a bar that weighs more than I did when I started CrossFit, which absolutely blows my mind since when I started I was too weak to even front rack the bar and would just use the tiniest little dumbells in all the workouts instead.

It can be slower progress at times if we had a long way to go in whatever sense, but we make progress no matter what. It really is about the scaling and the recovery. Those make all the difference. When I start to be self-critical like thinking I had a really ugly workout because the score wasn't what I thought I could do, I remind myself that nobody is paying me to do this and I got great benefit just from giving it my best.

                        <div class="comment-body">The bigger issue at hand here is the president wielding a power to try and control independent companies.

For anyone who doesn't understand, these are not government organizations. They are independent companies. The president nor anyone in the government has any say in how they run their operations. If true AI ever emerges, and the government wants to take control of it, that's one thing, but for now this is the equivalent of Trump telling Burger King they can't sell Impossible burgers anymore because he doesn't like it.

A true declaration of an AI race would be the US government funding their own AI project, not using independent companies to hopefully achieve that goal.</div>

I would say this would probably a pretty good criticism if we were talking about the first Trump term but not this. The EO is going to be tied to government contracts and so that's the lever they're looking to wield. As in telling the DoD or Intelligence community (or whomever) they can't buy an AI product that isn't "politically neutral" by their skewed and self-serving definition.

I haven't seen any details about what this means but I've seen it mentioned that the vendors will have to certify that their products are politically neutral. At which point it's probably not a huge deal. But I read that from a very tertiary source that was itself sourcing a publication sourcing a knowledgeable anonymous source. So grain of salt and all that.

If it's something more than that then I would imagine they will be taken to court.

&gt; this is the equivalent of Trump telling Burger King they can't sell Impossible burgers anymore because he doesn't like it.

Probably more to the point that this would be like saying you're not allowed to research anything that could potentially lead to an impossible burger. Because this just throws up roadblocks because of fully grown adults who never managed to develop a real skillset or learn how manage their emotions.

If you are a fully grown adult and get upset because a chatbot just didn't say your favorite thing then you need to seek professional help.</div>

They can't release it because the Biden administration sealed away thousands of pages of Epstein-related evidence.. They have to ask a judge to unseal it.

Ok to be fair, if AI is disagreeing with the user then that's a very big red flag of deliberate bias. 

Not saying it should ideally be like that and not saying you can't use custom behaviors and constant reinforcement against sycophantic behavior to minimize this, but if AI isn't agreeing with you then you should be asking why.</div>

The next day it was bad and my parents wouldn't take me to the ER.

So I called 911. And the EMTs were great while my parents were trying to convince them it was just anxiety and not to take me. I had to go by myself in the ambulance because my parents were furious at me and threatening to not pick me up.

It turned out I was right. I was grateful to the EMTs who handled my parents very well.

Your surgery will go well! I've been through a lot, and honestly appendectomy was pretty simple compared to a lot of things.</div>

Everywhere is filled with "LLMs will never be AGI" posts. 

It's not like I'm opposed to discussing whether or not LLMs are on the path to AGI, it's a fun subject. But having the same posts with the same standard arguments under almost any topic in the entire AI / machine learning space does get old.</div>

All it took was for reddit liberals to get pissed about art being stolen to completely turn them against all AI. The people who grew up loving science and tech who watched Star Trek and hoped for a technologically advanced future brainwashed into hating AI and "tech bros". Strange though that one article says AI is a stochastic parrot and the next that AI will take all jobs and the same people will dismiss it and the fear it 5 minutes later. The technology subreddit is the worst offender for this and those people have been coming to this sub lately.</div>

This connection between Donald Barr and Jeffrey Epstein has been a topic of discussion, particularly in relation to Bill Barr's role as Attorney General during Epstein's legal proceedings, according to Time Magazine.

U.S. Attorney General Barr won't recuse himself from New York case against Epstein: official | Reuters https://share.google/OJBKgieV2m9DZZLoW


 Alexander Acosta, a prominent figure in the legal and political landscape, is known for his role in the Jeffrey Epstein case as the then-U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. 

Here's a breakdown of his involvement:
Plea Deal: In 2008, Acosta approved a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) for Epstein, allowing him to plead guilty to state charges related to prostitution in exchange for avoiding federal prosecution.

Controversy and Criticism: This deal sparked significant controversy, particularly because victims were not notified and a federal judge later ruled it violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act. The Miami Herald reports that this deal "essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein's sex crimes".

Acosta's Defense: Acosta defended his actions, stating that the agreement ensured Epstein faced jail time and was registered as a sex offender. However, this defense was questioned by former prosecutors and victims' advocates.
Department of Justice Review: A Department of Justice review later found that Acosta exercised "poor judgment" in granting the NPA but didn't find evidence of misconduct driven by factors like Epstein's wealth or status.

Resignation as Labor Secretary: Amid public outrage and scrutiny surrounding his handling of the case, Acosta resigned as President Trump's Labor Secretary in July 2019.


Current Status: Acosta is no longer in government, and many of the other individuals involved in the 2008 plea deal have also left their government positions. 

Trump has all these connections to Epstein' and installed people who were involved in not only the sweet deal Epstein got but also all legal matters afterwards 

Trump is the one at the top of the conspiracy I'd reckon maybe he's not that smart but maybe he's one hell of a pimp and I mean that in the worst way possible.</div>

We’re only a little over halfway into the year of AI agents and they’re already completing economically valuable tasks equal to or better than humans in half the cases tested, and that’s including tasks that would take a human 10+ hours to complete.

I genuinely don’t understand how anyone could read this and still think AGI is 5+ years away.</div>

We know basically nothing, so from a scientific point of view there is not much to be excited about. Especially the lack of information around how much of the economically valuable tasks are represented in this benchmark. OpenAI may just have cherry-picked tasks that they expected their model to perform well on.</div>

Facts don’t care about your feelings, but the “fuck your feelings” crowd sure does seem to have some strong feelings (OPINIONS) about  actual verified facts.

                                <div class="reply-body">Back under Reagan, when they were doing such stuff (Reagan's VP, Bush Sr, saying "atheists can't be good citizens" and demonizing of non christians by republicans/conservatives), they were at least trying to keep these things in the economic sector. Likewise with Bush Jr (dare to criticize the war in Iraq in 2005...).

Now that the republican party stands for MAGA, aka a cult of personality movement, coherence has flown out the window.

It's truly Eco's Ur-Fascism theory, in which any semblance of truth or coherent belief is subsumed under "loyalty".

Between coherent rational thinking and proving your loyalty to your leader, the choice is easy for cult followers. Think that republicans were reduced to try to rationalize Musk and Bannon doing nazi salutes, they'll be able to attempt the same over this.

Cognitive dissonance is strong in conservatives.</div>

                <div class="post-content">After conducting some tests, I'm convinced that K2 either distilled from Claude or trained on Claude-generated code. 

Every AI model has its own traits when generating code. For example:

* Claude Sonnet 4:  likes gradient backgrounds, puts "2024" in footers, uses  less stock photos
* Claude Sonnet 3.7: Loves stock photos, makes everything modular
* GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro: Each has their own habits

I've tested some models and never seen two produce such similar outputs... until now.

It seems cheap, but all of the companies do this.

Plus, the GPT models aren’t that great and popular for coding among the general public when you look at benchmarks like LM Arena and Design Arena. On both benchmarks, Open AI models are outranked by Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet 4, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Deepseek R1.

Why does Open AI lag behind the other model providers so much in terms of coding? </div>

                <div class="post-content">In Eastern philosophies/religions, meditation is combined with practises which are intended to grow compassion. Out of this context, meditation doesn’t immediately equal compassion for others etc. you need intention.

Meditation is used by wealthy individuals engaged in intense business dealings, so they can feel calm and then be more focused and efficient to get more wealth. It is used by military personnel before operations where they need to be precise in combat!

                        <div class="comment-body">That's why view is important. There's a saying in Buddhism that meditation without view is like a blind man wandering a plain. He's moving along, but doesn't know where he's going. View is the worldview or perspective that comes from studying the teachings.

I'm not so sure, though, that it's a matter of good or bad. I think it's more a matter of depth. A lot of people mean well, trying to use meditation to reduce anxiety, calm their mind, sleep better, etc. It's the classic American strategy of wanting a pill for everything. One pill, no effort, no understanding needed. That's why Oprah and other Hollywood hotshots are losing weight with Ozempic. It's effortless.

Some people try to find their third eye, or get blissed out. Some people meditate a lot trying to be a good person. That's also wrong view. But it could be a very good start. We all have to start somewhere. If we had no selfish intentions then we wouldn't need to meditate.</div>
