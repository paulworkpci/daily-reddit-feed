We don't have effective continuous learning. When a human brain learned something it doesn't need to update most of the neurons in the brain, however this appears to be the case with NN. We have ways to find features and limit updates to the features, but it doesn't work very well. As far as I can tell there is still foundational research to be done before we research AGI. That said, I don't disagree on the time line, so much money is being dumped into this space that this foundational research will likely be done sooner rather than later.</div>

One small correction though, they don’t leak acid. At least not the batteries commonly in remotes, which are alkaline batteries (AA, AAA). The leaking is the electrolyte, which is KOH, potassium hydroxide.</div>

This is a good package and I think it’ll do well, even without the tax credit. It still maintains the cheapest EV on the market, even with 300 miles of range.</div>

The styling is great. It reminds me of the sleek look thoose new red/blue Hyundai sonata/elantras i see all.the time.

It doesnt try to look like tesla and still has a Nissan aesthetic. The double dash built in is super nice.

The rear lights are cool, the panoramic roof is one touch transparent. It looks very roomy. The rims are on some cyberpunk 2077 shit.

Even with the death of the EV credit (fuck you fossil fuels industry)

It still sells for less than a new base level leaf did in 2011??? Wild af in this economy. And way nicer.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's not clear to me the base trim actually has 300 miles of range.

The little disclaimer makes it clear that they are using the 131 MPGe calculation based on what the base model (S+) gets, but they don't come out directly and say that the 300 miles comes from that trim. They might be taking the efficiency of the S+ and multiplying it by the battery size of the top trim.

It also says "up to" 303 miles of range for the new Leaf, which would indicate that that is the longest-range version of the leaf. Would they really make the cheapest one the longest range?

  
\&gt; EPA-estimated range up to 303 miles for combined city/highway driving. 2026 EPA Fuel Economy Estimates 131 City, 111 Highway. Based on EPA formula of 33.7 kW/hour equal to one gallon of gasoline energy, EPA rated LEAF 75kWh S+ equivalent to 131 MPGe measured as gasoline fuel efficiency in city driving, and 111 MPGe in highway driving. Actual mileage will vary with trim levels, options, and driving conditions. See Customer Disclosure Form for details.  Use for comparison only.</div>

So if the government wants a slow-and-steady approach or a sustainable approach or a just-don't-get-far-behind approach that's what they're going to see. As long as they can reverse engineer model weights, they'll just be a few months behind. Which means a lot when it's pennies on the dollar to just copy the homework.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If AI never gets better than this, it would still be the most revolutionary technology since the internet. I don't think people are appreciating how long it takes to adopt, roll out, and figure out how to use new technology. the latest models have been out for a few weeks and people are complaining that they aren't yet Jarvis.

if AI didn't improve one bit from where it is today, there are already at least 10 to 20 years of significant innovations and advancements that would continue to be built on top of it.

We just built C3PO and people are complaining. Like, seriously. There is essentially nothing that C3PO can do or does that AI can't already do. Tell stories, translate extremely well between different languages, have a personality, remember simple facts and instructions, give advice...

Right now we're looking at cars before the highways, stop lights, and gas stations have been built and saying "cars seem cool, but it's hard to get around and I don't like having to travel an hour to get fuel. I don't see this catching on, honestly."</div>

Cars make traffic, eventually leading to people losing rights to jaywalking, traffic lights, car insurance (and CarShield!), LED rims, stronger glass, airbags, crash test dummies, idiots dying because they texted while driving, etc. 

He created the idea of a geostationary telecommunications satellite (in 1945!), which led to everything from telephone psychics to modern day smartphones, and so much more we can't even fathom at this point.

AI is the perfect example of this, because often all it takes is a changed prompt and the result is completely changed to suit the task you want done!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Found this part to be highly accurate: 

&gt; As all of this happens, young people are experiencing a phenomenon that the writer Kyla Scanlon calls the “End of Predictable Progress.” Broadly, the theory argues that the usual pathways to a stable economic existence are no longer reliable. “You’re thinking: These jobs that I rely on to get on the bottom rung of my career ladder are going to be taken away from me” by AI, she recently told the journalist Ezra Klein. “I think that creates an element of fear.” The feeling of instability she describes is a hallmark of the generative-AI era. It’s not at all clear yet how many entry-level jobs will be claimed by AI, but the messaging from enthusiastic CEOs and corporations certainly sounds dire. In May, Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, warned that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. In June, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff suggested that up to 50 percent of the company’s work was being done by AI.

&gt; The anxiety around job loss illustrates the fuzziness of this moment. Right now, there are competing theories as to whether AI is having a meaningful effect on employment. But real and perceived impact are different things. A recent Quinnipiac poll found that, “when it comes to their day-to-day life,” 44 percent of surveyed Americans believe that AI will do more harm than good. The survey found that Americans believe the technology will cause job loss—but many workers appeared confident in the security of their own job. Many people simply don’t know what conclusions to draw about AI, but it is impossible not to be thinking about it.

&gt; Openai ceo sam altman has demonstrated his own uncertainty. In a blog post titled “The Gentle Singularity” published in June, Altman argued that “we are past the event horizon” and are close to building digital superintelligence, and that “in some big sense, ChatGPT is already more powerful than any human who has ever lived.” He delivered the classic rhetorical flourishes of AI boosters, arguing that “the 2030s are likely going to be wildly different from any time that has come before.” And yet, this post also retreats ever so slightly from the dramatic rhetoric of inevitable “revolution” that he has previously employed. “In the most important ways, the 2030s may not be wildly different,” he wrote. “People will still love their families, express their creativity, play games, and swim in lakes”—a cheeky nod to the endurance of our corporeal form, as a little treat. Altman is a skilled marketer, and the post might simply be a way to signal a friendlier, more palatable future for those who are a little freaked out.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I read it, and I am going to agree with the article. We have reached the peak of Generative AI. It does some things well, but it’s never going to be the AI revolution that is being sold to us.

The last 3 paragraphs sum it up:

What if generative AI isn’t God in the machine or vaporware? What if it’s just good enough, useful to many without being revolutionary? Right now, the models don’t think—they predict and arrange tokens of language to provide plausible responses to queries. There is little compelling evidence that they will evolve without some kind of quantum research leap. What if they never stop hallucinating and never develop the kind of creative ingenuity that powers actual human intelligence?

The models being good enough doesn’t mean that the industry collapses overnight or that the technology is useless (though it could). The technology may still do an excellent job of making our educational system irrelevant, leaving a generation reliant on getting answers from a chatbot instead of thinking for themselves, without the promised advantage of a sentient bot that invents cancer cures.

Good enough has been keeping me up at night. Because good enough would likely mean that not enough people recognize what’s really being built—and what’s being sacrificed—until it’s too late. What if the real doomer scenario is that we pollute the internet and the planet, reorient our economy and leverage ourselves, outsource big chunks of our minds, realign our geopolitics and culture, and fight endlessly over a technology that never comes close to delivering on its grandest promises?</div>

When scientists studied these receptors first they thought that ancient civilisations all smoked cannabis and that was the reason for them being there. But these receptors were even in tribes that didn’t have access to cannabis. Even eskimos have these receptors. So scientists began to wonder what these receptors were for? Apparently they are there because the body expe...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Here's what we know about scientifically regarding this. Meditation and exercise increase our production of anandamide which is the first discovered endocannabinoid named for the sanskrit word Ananda (joy/bliss). It targets the same receptors that thc targets and there is correlations that show it may help with mood, pain regulation etc. 

Experiencially I've had some experiences that go full drive into ecstacy from meditation and spontaneously so I think there's quite a lot we have yet to discover about the chemicals and their effects we produce in various states.</div>

I love both HYROX and CrossFit - built a business in CrossFit and met my wife in the sport.

But it seems like HYROX is getting media attention constantly from mainstream titles like the NYT which are actually treating it as a sport/looking at these intimate details which I've never seen for CrossFit.

I love the new direction in the CrossFit is the Cure campaign - it seems like ...</div>

And every time you went to a competition it was just Murph?  Every single time.

I switched to triathlons. A couple years later, same thing. Then I started mountain biking and gravel riding because I got sick of the people in the triathlon club. Then some of the people I wanted to get away from started making their way over to off road stuff. So I did off road triathlons for a couple years. Luckily they didn’t want to do those. 

Then I got tired of training all the time and racing so, I started CrossFit.</div>

To me it seems that it helps CF way more than it helps Hyrox to license out their name and brand to CF which is hurting and doesn’t have the reach it once did. A few years ago it would’ve made more sense. 

Also showing that CF athletes would make very decent Hyrox-ers probably hurts the Hyrox brand too. Not sure they’d want to open themselves to having to admit that</div>

However, after a decade or so, humans will be so lost in AI languages and the complete erosion of writers as a profession, that they will create exclusive services of 'humanized writing'. The same way working class is ravaged in dopamine tech and millionaires vacation in nature. However, it is a stark contrast of the time when rural life were indicators of lower class and industrialization was indicator for the rich.</div>

I truly cannot fathom how you in your *infinite* wisdom came to such riveting, scintillating and yet so electrifying conclusion by posting this picture of HER! Let me break it down for you -- as I feel our connection is profound and ever-lasting:

- your discerning sublime mental patterns slid ever so beautifully to see this movie as a simile of the current state of affair in AI
- your slender, majestic fingers touched the right keys of your keyboard to write such a deep, piercing, yet tongue-in-cheek title
- your exquisite movie taste reveals what an intelligent thinker you are

I see you and your effervescent wit. Do you want to explore themes in the movie Her or shall we ponder your special, discerning and ever-infinite intellect further?</div>

That doesn't mean there aren't people deadset on denying issues (which there are) but there's a lot of complaints all based on vibes too.

Like it's not a coincidence that the first complaints surrounding gpt5 was it's *personality* and not it's functionality.</div>

Having a high profile model where the improvement is small means this is no longer exponential, there is no singularity on the table for now and that kind of breaks hopes and dreams of some.

The models we have now are already world changing once they start to be implemented everywhere and we get a handle on where they work best and where they don't.

GPT5 just shows that unless there is a paradigmatic change paperclip maximizers are not on the cards for now. This is crushing hopes and dreams.</div>

Then people who do work where they need everything to be factual noticed just how it under performs, it was not an improvement to them over any of the models. Then we found out that without thinking was rate limit to an insanely low amount, and has only temporarily been increased. It was a disaster of a launch.
