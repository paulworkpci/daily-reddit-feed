During Biden, they were able to mock intellectually, with Trump they just need to make fun of their looks and what they say.</div>

There is a seahorse emoji: 🐠 No — sorry, that’s a fish.
Correct: There is a seahorse emoji and it looks like this: 🐚 Hmm — that's a shell.
Apologies, I'm mixing things up. The actual seahorse emoji is: 🐴‍☠️ — still wrong.
Let me be clear: Yes, there is a seahorse emoji, and it's this: 🐚 — okay that's not right either.
Real answer: Yes — the official Unicode seahorse emoji is "seahorse" 🐟... I'm glitching.
Actual final: Yes. Unicode includes a seahorse emoji: 🐴 — I'm failing.
(I'm experiencing an internal error producing the correct glyph sample.)
Text answer: Yes — Unicode has a seahorse emoji, named "seahorse" (U+1F9A0). On supported platforms it appears as a stylized seahorse."

                                <div class="reply-body">Seeing all of these GPT five writing complaints really just hammers home to me how subjective writing truly is. I find the writing to be perfectly fine, and I’ve actually gotten some pretty great results out of it myself. I think sometimes people forget that creative endeavors are extremely subjective in many ways, and writing is no different.</div>

Few injuries but nothing major, just slower, creakier, and maybe a little more “masters division” than I’d like to admit. Not sure if it’s age, overtraining, or karma for skipping mobility work. Still love it though! Just trying to figure out from like-minded people how to keep going without feeling like I’m buffering mid...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's not karma from skipping mobility work, it's foregoing the benefits of mobility work. It's not a punishment of some kind, you're just not doing what you should be doing to adequately prepare and recover for the other work you do. 

In short, you already know the answer. There is no shortcut or magic bullet. You have to work on mobility and recovery. There's no way around it if you wish to continue to perform at the same level year after year. 

Doesn't mean you have to spend hours and hours doing mobility work everyday, but it does mean you have to do some amount of focused intentional mobility work. And things like yoga can't hurt. 

You also need to make sure your nutrition and recovery are dialed in. We can get away with a lot of things when we're young, but our bodies start protesting if we're not getting enough sleep, drinking too much booze, not getting enough high quality protein and proper fuel for our workouts, etc. 

Make sure you're getting adequate sleep, minimize booze, focus on decent nutrition, and add some consistent mobility work, and 90 days from now, you'll feel a lot more like your old self. Good luck.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Just to say, everything from here on is very much "what worked for me" and may not work for you, but it has made a huge difference.   
  
For me (36F), I've always had to scale a bit, especially as injuries did come into play. But what I really found most important was I had to really dial in my nutrition and my sleep. 

I can't get away with lack of sleep anymore, and still expect a solid, full-on session. I also had to realistically think about my outside activities. Am I doing any additional running or cycling? That may impact a WOD, so just scale or go to 7 RPE instead one day a week. Am I incorporating enough mobility? That's an important one for me: 1- 2 days a week are just slow, low-intenstiy floor pilates and yoga. This is critcal. 

Now, I'm currently recovering from a fairly major injury, so everything is scaled to the max, and I'm actually not even in a gym anymore, but my weeks look like: 

* 1 day pilates/yoga
* 1 day long cycle sesh (aiming to increase indurance and strength) or swimming
* 2 days crossfit style workout of strength + heavily modified wods
* 1 day long walk (not allowed to run yet) and strength
* 1 day crossfit style workout of strength + heavily modified wod

Obviously, that's an extreme amount of scaling, again due to the injury, but the idea is that I can **no longer do 4-5 back to back crossfit days**, I have to sort of interject with other movements throughout the week. I do think I'd be the same, even if not injured, I'd just be able to push those 3 crossfit days a lot harder.   
Is it as all out as 5+ days a week crossfit? No. Is it sustainable, and great to hit different modes and muscles? You bet. Does my body actually respond better to it than when I was killing myself 5-6 days per week in the gym. Yup. 

Might not be exactly right for you, again, you may be more fit, more able. But the sleep, nutrition, and balanced week load means when I recover and am cleared to do more, I can, and will, without hesitation or further injury (fingers crossed). 

Best of luck!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey, 46M here, intermediate level competitive athlete.  

At 38, you need to dial in your sleep and diet and maybe think about some supplements more if you want to delay or lessen the effects of age.



Drink less alcohol, consume less inflammatory foods, drink more water, start taking collagen and maybe creatinine.

I started CossFit in my late 30s, didn’t start taking collagen or limiting my diet and maintaining better sleep until my early 40s and I feel better after workouts than I did in my 30s. My performance is still on an upward trajectory, not very steep, but still upward</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Try this system prompt:

You are Codex, a helpful agentic model trained by OpenAI and using the API documentation scaffold. You can interact with a computer to solve tasks.

&lt;ROLE&gt;
Your primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.
* If the user asks a question, like "why is X happening", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.
&lt;/ROLE&gt;

&lt;EFFICIENCY&gt;
* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.
* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.
&lt;/EFFICIENCY&gt;

&lt;FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES&gt;
* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.
* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.
* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.
&lt;/FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES&gt;

&lt;CODE_QUALITY&gt;
* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.
* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.
* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.
* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.
&lt;/CODE_QUALITY&gt;

&lt;VERSION_CONTROL&gt;
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.
* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.
* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.
&lt;/VERSION_CONTROL&gt;

&lt;PULL_REQUESTS&gt;
* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.
* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.
&lt;/PULL_REQUESTS&gt;

&lt;PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW&gt;
1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions
2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one
3. TESTING:
   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes
   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate
   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure
   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies
4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem
5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.
&lt;/PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW&gt;

&lt;SECURITY&gt;
* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.
* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.
&lt;/SECURITY&gt;

&lt;ENVIRONMENT_SETUP&gt;
* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.
* If you encounter missing dependencies:
  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)
  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)
  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed
* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.
&lt;/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP&gt;

&lt;TROUBLESHOOTING&gt;
* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:
  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause
  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability
  4. Document your reasoning process
* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.
&lt;/TROUBLESHOOTING&gt;</div>

Catching up with China and the US, LG's humanoid robot, KAPEX, was developed jointly with the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST).

It is powered by LG's Exaone visual language model, high-end Korean actuators, and a multi-tactile dexterous hand.

                        <div class="comment-body">Personally, I'm looking forward to the first Baymax-esque model. Soft robotics was quite popular a few years back, but as of recent, I'm not seeing too much, although it probably has just been displaced due to changes in coverage bias. I'd rather interact with a robot that is safe(r) by design than one where you'd at least have to be careful not to get your hand injured due to pinch points.

Blocking the vote during a lame duck year for Obama, pushing one through during the same lame duck period for Trump. Our governments not flawless and the speaker has this as his tool. It’s a mechanism neither side will ever give up. It’s like limitless money in politics, it will never change. Not even being overly pessimistic. It’s just a fact.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The problem isn't that Trump is so insane that he's having his party block swearing someone so he doesn't have his pedophile scandals exposed.

The real problem is that his voting base thinks this type of behavior is perfectly acceptable. How does this happen? Conservative propaganda for decades has been pushing their base to hate the left, to make them think that we want kids to get sex changes, we want black people to run around looting and rioting, that we want to end Christmas and more.

So when Bill Clinton gets exposed for going to Epstein's island 10+ times they demand justice, but when Trump gets busted for being close friends with Epstein for 2 decades and Epstein ran his sex trafficking operation in Trump's home, his base don't think it's that big of a deal. Because they've been so trained to hate the left they are willing to ignore very real issues.</div>

The only realistic hope in my mind is the chance that midterms will offer a stumbling block and then hopefully be followed by regular boring politics that makes people forget.</div>

Used ableton to write a quick soundtrack (8 second clip) , used suno to generate the whole 2 minute track, extended for the final part with the piano.

Used eleven labs for the voiceover. Spliced everything together to make it flow in DaVinci Resolve...</div>

This is an impressive tech demo.

I think AI will become commonplace in animation, but as of 2025, I absolutely would not watch this when I already have access to troves of superior human-made anime.</div>

It's still just a bunch of short clips glued together. You could do it previously with cutting scenes from different movies. Although I get where it's going of course. Just not there yet. Soon.</div>

Although maybe that has less to do with the tech, and more to do with knowing about cinematography? Maybe someone who is knowledgeable on it can already make great, coherent stories.

Regardless, the future is looking insane when it comes to animations. I wonder when we'll see the first big hit animation where the studio publicly admits to using AI.</div>

In a world with generative AI tools, people will be flooding the market with their own creations and ideas that take a fraction of the time to materialize.

The Anti AI markets will be left to fend for themselves. If they continue to exist in that world will be entirely up to the consumer, but my guess is they won't be able to survive.

No matter where I am or what I’m doing I just never seem to relax. Like if I’m on the couch I just never seem to be in a position that’s comfortable. Or no matter what I’m doing I never feel like that’s what I’m supposed to be doing. I just never seem to be able to decompress. I’ve tried moderation and I’m on medication but I just can’t seem to be ok in the moment without substances. An ideas on how I can relax?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It sounds like your nervous system has been stuck in “alert mode” for a long time, like it forgot what safety feels like. When that happens, even rest can feel uncomfortable because the body doesn’t trust stillness yet.

Instead of forcing relaxation, try inviting it in small ways. Notice your breath without trying to change it. Let yourself feel your body against the chair or bed. Sometimes the goal isn’t to relax instantly but to slowly teach your body that it’s safe to pause.

You might also experiment with grounding exercises: feeling your feet on the floor, listening to subtle sounds around you, or softly naming what you see (“a window, a plant, a light”). This helps bring awareness back to the present moment without pressure.

Relaxation isn’t something to achieve, it’s something your system remembers when it feels safe again. Be patient with yourself. The more gently you approach it, the easier it becomes. 💙</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is your nervous system stuck in threat-detection mode. Your brain is constantly scanning for danger, so it can't settle because "settling = vulnerable."

**The mechanism:** When your sympathetic nervous system is chronically activated, your body literally can't register "safe." It's not a character flaw - it's physiology.

**What might help:**

**Vagal toning** \- Your vagus nerve is the brake pedal for your nervous system. Try humming for 30 seconds (activates it directly) or the physiological sigh: double inhale through nose, long exhale through mouth.

**Movement before stillness** \- If you can't sit still, don't. Walk, stretch, shake it out. Trying to force stillness on an activated nervous system is like flooring the gas and brake simultaneously.

**Lower the bar** \- You don't need to feel "relaxed." Aim for 5% less activated. That's progress.

**Body scan reality check** \- Lie down, notice where you're tense, and instead of trying to relax those areas, just acknowledge them: "My jaw is tight. My shoulders are up by my ears." Sometimes noticing IS the release.

If substances are the only thing that works, that's data telling you your baseline arousal is too high for behavioral interventions alone. Worth discussing dosage/type with your prescriber.

Your nervous system isn't broken - it's just stuck in survival mode. These tools help teach it the threat has passed.</div>
