The Middle East is changing, and the fact that the protests started just before the war is kind of a sign that you might win this time. Iranians are dealing with the same dictatorship. I think the world powers that have held the Middle East are losing their grip. Like in chess, the most important place is in the middle—whoever controls it controls the whole chessboard. So, in a way, it’s not really up to you guys. The fact that protests even started now wasn’t up to you; it’s all part of a bigger plan, and normal people like you and me can do nothing about it. Just stay safe—it’s not worth dying. A few years ago, they killed 1,500 protesters in three days in Iran. The outcome of any revolution isn’t up to the people; there are powers at play beyond our imaginations.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Europe, seriously, are you even paying attention?

Right now in Turkey, secular, democratic, and progressive people are literally fighting for basic freedoms against a government that's openly Islamist, authoritarian, and Erdoganist. Ekrem İmamoğlu, a key opposition leader, just got jailed on flimsy charges. Protestors demanding democracy and human rights are being beaten, arrested, and silenced. Opposition media outlets are under constant threat, facing shutdowns and crippling fines for just daring to speak the truth.

Yet somehow, Europe seems okay watching from the sidelines. You're basically shrugging off people who genuinely share your values—secularism, democracy, human rights, science, art, and environmental awareness. These folks aren't just allies; they're your natural partners in a region sliding dangerously towards authoritarianism.

And here's a reality check: if these Islamist, Erdoganist forces had their way, they'd gladly roll back every single freedom Europeans hold dear. What’s happening in Turkey today is a preview of what they'd do everywhere if they could.

So wake up, Europe. Stand clearly and firmly with the secular, democratic voices in Turkey or admit you're just quietly watching Erdogan dismantle democracy while hoping he stays out of your backyard.</div>

Europe has it's own issues with Russia now. They won't care about anything else until this problem is solved. Look what happened in Syria and EU is happy with it. Don't expect different reaction for Turkiye. Actually they don't like these protests. Germans do good business under current goverment. Changes can make it worse.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">All you're doing with this comment is making it sound like a US psyop. Like every point you brought up is straight out of the CIA playbook. They disseminate propaganda through local media outlets (using organizations like USAID/NED), collude with local oppposition leaders and then accuse the government of totalitarianism if it responds, which they hope mobilizes the local population to overthrow the government forcefully through a coup.

Not that it means Erdogan isn't a tyrant, but I'm just saying corruption and neglect of basic needs like education, health, pollution for corporate collusion is the point you should be bringing up. 

The legitimacy of crackdowns is always very hard to gauge when the groups being persecuted are pro-western/liberal because US interference is a very real and widespread thing. When it's legitimate, it's often based on covert sources because states don't want to expose what they know to the US, the same way the US doesn't want to expose its assets to the local government. Doesn't mean the evidence is flimsy, it simply means that it's opaque.</div>

It's still total bs though, the guy is a total nut and not impartial at all, he's all over alien documentaries and conspiracy stuff. The scans from the new study barely look like more than noise, and he has gone around promoting these big claims using AI renders of the structures based on purely what he assumes the scans represent, before he even let anyone see the study and raw data.

                <div class="post-content">I have been aware of the bad effects of surfing since over 5 years now. While i have been addicted, since over 15 years now. I can’t remember the last time i went to the toilet without mindlessly surfing there (especially for business nr. 2). The thought of going to the toilet makes me feel anxious.

This is it! But now I have made up my minds. Time to take actions.

I plan to start slow step by.

From now on, I will intentionally go to the toilet without my phone.
That is it for now.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Soooo I am a mom of 2, back in 2021 I started having bowel issues and went to my obgyn thinking I had a vaginal prolapse from giving birth, she referred me to a urogynecologist who found that I had a stage 1 rectal prolapse, a "rectocele" and I had to do physical therapy for it. When I was talking with the urogyn about what could have caused this she mentioned sitting on the toilet for too long especially on your phone not paying attention to how much time has passed and how it puts pressure on your pelvic floor and weakens it. I often sit there on my phone until my legs fall asleep (it's the only peace I get from the kids). She said it could have been caused by giving birth but I had my last kid in 2018 and this started in mid 2021 so she thinks lack of core strength and sitting long periods on the toilet (on my phone 🫢) May have exasperated the issue. </div>

There are many cases where legislators submit bills without ever reading them, and they have placeholders like "(insert Senator name here)" still in the bill submitted.  Its not unexpected, but just disappointing.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I've said before, Andrew Yang had a lot of good ideas:

- Tech is the oil of the 21st century and we should tax it like it is oil.
- Automation should be taxed. 
- Some form of UBI is good. I don't know what that form is myself but it has to be something.

But the guy was hopelessly naive like most Obama-era Democrats in the late 2010's. He kept insisting that there was a rational reason for people voting Trump and we've seen in the subsequent 8 years there isn't. Extending the olive branch to barely literate animals didn't do the Dems much good. They got Dick Cheney, Liz Cheney, John Bolton etc. on board to endorse Harris this time around and it failed. Biden mostly left Trump alone during his time in office and it did nothing to quell his venom.

Yang is now realizing this about 5-8 years too late. A lot of people, including people who are now Trump supporters, will realize this far too late when all is said and done, if at all.</div>

I turned 30 this year. And for some reason, maybe due to hormone, diet, lifestyle whatever, around November last year, my libido just plummeted. No more morning wood, random boners. Even the thought of sex or a looking at salacious content feels completely vapid. 

Consequently, my productivity has increased exponentially. I used to struggle to just go through a text-book. Now I've mad significant progress in two personal project wile simultaneously changing my entire development...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s only over 1 when considering just the thin film capacitor, not the high voltage power supply. They’ll need to be able to consistently replicate this and do it in a way that rules out electrostatic or other parasitic interactions with the environment.

You can rub a balloon on your head and get it to demonstrate “greater than 1 TWR” by holding another charged balloon near it. A piece of candy wrapper that keeps sticking to your fingers can easily have greater than 1 TWR.

They’ll need a repeatable setup in a vacuum chamber and they’ll need to demonstrate why it’s not interacting through conventional means. This will then need to be replicated. All of this takes time. 

I am very dubious that their theoretical explanation is correct, but they might inadvertently have stumbled across an effect some other theory like quantized inertia can explain. If it’s a capacitor with electron tunneling current, that very well could explain it. Of course, QI could also be wrong.</div>

But when an artist, or any creative, tells you how it took an exorbitant amount of time to finish a piece, it's most often because they simply never know when to be finished and move on to the next work.  If it would have taken a few weeks or months to get 90% of the way on this shot, and they used that, the world probably would not have been able to tell the difference had they not publicized their time spent.  As an art school graduate myself, I can tell you that for many artists the extra time can just add noise to an often already satisfactory piece.</div>

It's been 3 days since I started reading consistently and deleted all social media. After a 6 hour study session today (took breaks in between ofc), I decided to watch a YouTube video (no BS. It was pretty informative). Then I scrolled through the business subreddit and little did I know how crazy it was gonna get.

                        <div class="comment-body">I think I know how you feel.

A long time ago, I did my own little "meditation retreat". No electronics, 2-3h of Meditation and multiple hours of reading every day. Apart from that I did Tai Chi, Yoga and went for walks.

After just 3 days of that, I felt completely different. I was so calm and happy as I haven't been in 10 years. And when I went back to using the Internet it was astonishing. Just being on the Youtube frontpage annoyed the heck out of me, because there was too much going on and, even more interestingly, I was annoyed by the non-importance of that stuff. It was like:"Why would I want to waste my time with that.", whereas in the past I would have clicked on some of those videos. I became MUCH more selective in what to watch.

When you are used to not being stimulated, it's easy to become over-stimulated and realizing that. Whereas when I'm already surfing the web a lot it takes a lot of overstimulation and multitasking to get me to the point where I'm litterally fed up with all the constant information. It gets so bad, that I feel like "I can't take all that shit anymore" and need to take a break from the internet. Staying away from the internet for a while gives your brain a chance to re-sensitize itself. You'll be overwhelmed easier with information on the Internet. That's my theory. It's like staying a way from porn for a few weeks. You brain will go wild just from seeing an inch of skin.

I also want to mention that I also have never used and never will use TikTok. I also don't use my phone. I generally don't even have it with me. Unfortunately, I'm using reddit quite a bit. And I've been meditating every day for years. So, I know how to focus and just "do nothing" and still a few days of no Internet had a huge impact on me. I can't even imagine what it would be like for a "normal" person.</div>

Super fast feedback rewiring your brain chemistry.

"what's the explanation behind it?" 

The brain is not designed to have that much stimulus and stay the same. It has to reconfigure to make sense of so much information. And it can't, because there are millions of videos on YT, millions of posts on reddit, etc, and they are ever changing. It is like reading a book but the pages switch places within the chapters. It is total chaos.

The solution? Greyscale. No music. Turn off the phone. Turn off the wifi. Exercise, breathing. Cold showers. Writing with pen and paper. Erase the excessive bookmarks. Declutter the desktop screen. Eliminate useless apps. We are in a pit and we have to climb back out.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's funny. I just asked Gemini to estimate its IQ yesterday and it gave a compelling answer that ultimately refused to give a number. Here's the last part of the answer:

Think of me as an incredibly sophisticated pattern-matching and text-generation machine. I excel at tasks involving processing and manipulating information found within my training data, doing so at superhuman speed and scale. However, I lack the general intelligence, understanding, consciousness, common sense, and subjective experience that define human cognition. Therefore, measuring me with a human yardstick like IQ doesn't fit. I am a powerful tool with specific, remarkable capabilities, but also clear and fundamental limitations.

It was 130 the whole time Gemini!</div>

I assume I must have said something mildly negative about Replit at some point, but nothing comes up in my tweet history for either his tag nor Replit. I never followed him, nor do I remember talking to him at any point ever.

Nothing says “safety” like operating a forklift (or driving to and from work) with a schedule like this, and youre putting both jobs, your safety, and the safety of others at risk. Depending on your construction job, you’re also increasing your risk of injury.

Look, i worked 70-105 hours a week for a long time (dont tell DOT), and Ill tell you, im lucky i didnt fuck myself up worse than i did. I was 27 when i tore my rotator cuff and hurt my neck. I have a ligament tear in my knee, and in my pinkie. And I may or may not have totaled a brand new Mercedes because in my exhaustion i confused unclipping my seatbelt with putting my vehicle in park.

I’d also do it all again if it were to see my kids, but seriously, *explore all of your other options first*</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I remember when my bf's (P) relationship with one of his closest friends (M) changed forever. We were all mid to late 20s at the time, and M lives a good hour and a half away, but they've been close since they were teens. Like, really close.

M was getting married. Hooray! P waited for the message or letter inviting him into the wedding party, but it never came, and he saw the party announced on FB. He shrugged it off. Probably wasn't in the party because our distance made it inconvenient. That's fine.

Until the actual wedding. I could see how much it hurt when we were sat at a table in the back of the room with complete strangers. We had a good time in general, but I don't even think we got to talk to the bride and groom for more than 10 seconds. He felt completely left out of what he thought was one of his closest friend's biggest days. Even worse when we found out M literally hated one of the guys he chose as his groomsmen, openly stated he wished he chose P instead and literally never talked to the other guy after the wedding.

Then he got divorced and remarried a few years later (a very good decision on his part, zero judgment there, trust me). P still wasn't in the wedding party. We don't visit at all anymore, really... Most I've interacted with M and his wife in years has been liking family update pictures.

Being sat at a randoms table at *both of his weddings* seems to have played a huge part in literally killing what was (at the time) an almost decade long friendship. I mean, they're still friends and on speaking terms... It's just not like it was. At all.</div>

There was a group at work around my age who’d go and play board games at lunch time, they never asked me to join them, because they didn’t think I’d want to, and I never joined them because I didn’t think they wanted me to. Until one day I did and 8 years later they’re some of my best friends, who I still see regularly despite not having worked with any of them for 3 years, and the majority of them even longer.

                                <div class="reply-body">The article makes a good point, benchmarks have always been designed to be just within reach. A real benchmark to measure economic impact would be 'onboard as a remote employee at company x and successfully work there for one month' but of course we're still a few steps away from that being a feasible way to measure agents. So at the moment, we focus on short term tasks like solving coding problems and googling information to compile a document.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Summary by perplexity if anyone doens't want to read the whole article -

The article discusses how AI benchmarks have evolved over time and why they haven't fully reflected the economic impacts of AI systems. Before 2017, benchmarks focused on simple tasks like image classification and sentiment analysis. Starting in 2018, they shifted to more complex tasks like coding and general knowledge questions. Recently, benchmarks have begun to assess AI in realistic scenarios, but they still often prioritize short tasks over those that reflect real-world economic challenges.

The design of these benchmarks mirrors the capabilities of AI systems at the time, focusing on tasks that are "just within reach" to provide effective training signals for improving models. Researchers often prioritize benchmarks that offer clear feedback rather than realistic tasks, as differences in scores on simpler tasks still correlate with broader capabilities.

The article cites the 2023 SWE-Bench as an example, which evaluates coding abilities on GitHub issues. Initially considered difficult, it gained relevance when SWE-agent surpassed expectations, achieving over 10 percent accuracy.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">My simple, probably ill-informed, take. When AI progress felt like a true 0-1 improvement we hardly heard about bench marks in the real world and the use cases were everywhere.

 Its the opposite now.

Maybe it's just more visibility, more models, more attention to bench marks. But real users don't care about bench marks and I've found that regular people don't see the big deal between 4o - 4.5, 3.5 sonnet - 3.7 sonnet. 

Something to think about I guess.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">but the last months with Claude Sonnet und now Gemini. The real impact is only about to start.   
Alone on Openrouter the usage went 4x in 3 month. Nearly doubling every month. 

We clearly hit now the implementation for 2. order companies. MCP is becoming quickly the standard. 



I mean the Internet didn't had many 0-1 moments for me. From my perspective, the Internet itself, Google, Wikipedia, Social Media with Facebook, maybe the Iphone moment.

but it touched nearly everything in society, how we pay, how we shop, how we find jobs, how to interact with friends, which jobs we do... hundred other things which just happened without people going "wow". 

Real change in the moment is often hard to see.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Iain M Banks talked about this 25 years ago before his untimely death and it's still my favourite take on the matter. I'd love to know his thoughts on the modern world and state of AI.


So what," the Chelgrian asked, "is the point of me or anybody else writing a symphony, or anything else?"

The avatar raised its brows in surprise. "Well, for one thing, you do it, it's you who gets the feeling of achievement."

"Ignoring the subjective. What would be the point for those listening to it?"

"They'd know it was one of their own species, not a Mind, who created it."

"Ignoring that, too; suppose they weren't told it was by an AI, or didn't care."

"If they hadn't been told then the comparison isn't complete; information is being concealed. If they don't care, then they're unlike any group of humans I've ever encountered."

"But if you can—"

"Ziller, are concerned that Minds—AIs, if you like—can create, or even just appear to create, original works of art?"

"Frankly, when they're the sort of original works of art that I create, yes."

"Ziller, it doesn't matter. You have to think like a mountain climber."

"Oh, do I?"

"Yes. Some people take days, sweat buckets, endure pain and cold and risk injury and—in some cases—permanent death to achieve the summit of a mountain only to discover there a party of their peers freshly arrived by aircraft and enjoying a light picnic."

"If I was one of those climbers I'd be pretty damned annoyed."

"Well, it is considered rather impolite to land an aircraft on a summit which people are at that moment struggling up to the hard way, but it can and does happen. Good manners indicate that the picnic ought to be shared and that those who arrived by aircraft express awe and respect for the accomplishment of the climbers.

"The point, of course, is that the people who spent days and sweated buckets could also have taken an aircraft to the summit if all they'd wanted was to absorb the view. It is the struggle that they crave. The sense of achievement is produced by the route to and from the peak, not by the peak itself. It is just the fold between the pages." The avatar hesitated. It put its head a little to one side and narrowed its eyes. "How far do I have to take this analogy, Cr. Ziller?

If you want a way to make doing so cheap and easy, you need 2 things: your favorite flavor of yogurt, and a high fiber cereal (ideally in small pieces rather than flakes, I like Bran Buds or something like thar). 

For yogurt, it can be one of the delicious high sugar flavors for kids, doesn't matter.

40 grams of the cereal is usually 50% or more of the fiber you need for an entire day, I just stir it into the serving/ little cup of yogurt,...</div>

ElonX sold mostly to liberals, and then bought xitter and went full fascist/racist and it lost customers, but I am not sure how much the stock dipped, lots of long range evs hadn’t come to market yet or were overpriced.

Kinda cool, mostly just a bunch of stuff on the walls to read with 3 AI depictions of Friedman, Hynek and Greer that will "answer" questions from visitors.

I guess Id compare it to the content presented in documentaries of late about the phenomenon, seemingly intended more for those new or not very versed in the subject. I dont think there was any mention of psionics and the like though.
