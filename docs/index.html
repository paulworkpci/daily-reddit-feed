                <div class="post-content">Okay, so I’ve been lurking here for a while and finally have something worth sharing. I know everyone’s been using Claude Code as the king of coding, but hear me out.

I was a loyal Claude subscriber paying $200/month for their coding plan. For months it was solid, but lately? Man, it’s been making some really dumb mistakes. Like, basic syntax errors, forgetting context mid-conversation, suggesting deprecated APIs. I’m pretty sure they’re running a quantized version now because the quality drop ...</div>

I still like Claude as a tool. It was the first GOOD agentic model.  Much of the ecosystem has been sort of tailored to Claude...which is a problem.

But anyway, I'm not poor, but it's nice to feel like I can afford to use something.</div>

Don't get me wrong. I use a lot of different LLMs for my solutions but I would need to know better your setup and solution use. Kimi K2 was impressive for us one hit wonders but it dies in the world.of maintaining a cosebase. I have yet to see anything that can build and maintain a large and complex codebase outside of a great agent and claide/gemini 2.5 before update. 

I would love for you to share before I  waste my time on another llm that about gets it but not yet.</div>

If GLM 4.5 is producing code that can match Opus, then I suspect you’re not using Opus correctly or it is complete overkill for the problems you’re attempting to tackle.

(And no I don’t walk barefoot down the aisle or take my flip flops during the flight next to my neighboring seats, just believe having the open air on my feet before I even arrive at the airport helps with the discomfort/potential smell of changing socks throughout the flight, which they let you wear through the tsa scan so you aren’t barefoot)</div>

In the 1990s, the North Atlantic cod fishery collapsed. Everyone knew the fish stocks were dwindling, but each fishing company kept pushing harder, hoping to outcompete the rest and survive. Instead, the whole ecosystem and the industry with it died.

AI-driven layoffs feel eerily similar. Every company is racing to slash labor costs before competitors do. B...</div>

You don't have to rely on a single scrap of good will for us to throw ourselves into a situation where the government is forced to support the common people in some fashion, and I'd wager, in a pretty damn nice fashion at that.

[I'll give a recap here but here's my longer form argument. It's written much better over here than I will below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1lqu2e5/comment/n15mr7h/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) I address things like robots here in greater detail.

--------

AI corporations will continue to work on AI, and in order to justify their funding, they will release models the very second they are considered safe to be turned loose. For the sake of this argument, let's assume they do it - they succeed, and AGI is revealed. It does everything you could hope for and more, but it isn't quite a magical ASI.

If you are a business owner, especially in a field that is predominantly work that can be done behind a computer/"remote," you are going to soon start feeling the pressure to adopt this AGI-agent in order to remain competitive. If you're in a noncompetitive market, the siren song of MORE PROFIT WIDER MARGINS MORE PROFIT will get louder with every month that passes as more and more businesses report success with the new agent.

This, however, puts us in a dilemma. Any job that 'can' be automated will be automated, due to aforementioned competitive pressures.

...but (as I talk more about in my linked comment chain above), the ability to massively automate physical labor is still years away at best. Decades at worst. But you're laying off all your white collar workers RIGHT NOW.

White collar workers make up the majority of consumer spending; the top 2/5ths of households make up 2/3rds of consumer spending, and those households are predominantly white collar.

So, what does this leave us? Consumer spending is tanking, productivity should be either level (1:1 person to agent) or increasing (AI that is more efficient on a per-person basis).

This explodes the economy. There's no "waiting it out." If you are an oligarch and want to finish automating the economy, you NEED the economy to keep running long enough to replace everybody, but there will be years to decades of time where you can only replace some people while the other people MUST continue to work. No economy, means zero work, means everybody loses.

Okay. That won't happen, obviously. The government will step in, right? I think that's a fair assessment - just like during Covid (though that would be peanuts compared to this), it will suddenly be in the best interest of 'everybody' to redistribute wealth enough to prop up consumer spending. You can be maximally greedy and still arrive at this conclusion. **You cannot exploit an economy that does not exist.**

...which, here's the kicker. Once a system like this is in place, the dynamic changes. Suppose you're a politician - a greedy, soul sucking politician - the single easiest way to garner more votes from your base is to promise more UBI/social support. Unlike today, where you must skim off of the productivity of other humans...in this new world, you're skimming off the top of AI. AI that does not vote, needs only a fraction as many resources as people (on a unit basis, bear with me here), and won't firebomb your datacenters if it goes hungry.

Greedy AI companies opened the door. Greedy businesses painted themselves/the economy into a corner. Greedy politicians keep us well fed and furnished for their own gain after we've gotten out of the bind.

Furthermore, as the economy grows faster and faster as AI continues to improve, the percentage of the whole that is required to support humans grows at the speed of humans, not the speed of GPU forges. Pretty soon, the struggle necessary to reclaim the rapidly dwindling sliver of productivity required to let every human live in luxury is just not worth the squeeze. Why bother? It becomes more profitable every year to put what you 'would' have used to reclaim that sliver into just...making more productivity.

A positive outcome overall, I'd say. It will **absolutely not be perfect**, but it's a long way from being left out to starve. I'm okay with living in a world like this, I think. There's obviously a lot of fine details that could make it better or worse for people, but on the whole, "we need to redistribute enough wealth to make up for the automation of the top 2/5ths of household income and their consumer spending, also we have exploding productivity that we can skim off the top of, good luck!" seems fine to me?

Happy to debate/discuss. I had to truncate a lot of points to fit into a single comment, so, I know there's holes. I welcome you to read my linked chain above to get the longer story, especially if you want to chat about it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think the problem is that UBI can only happen by extremely raising taxes on the companies that are going to increasingly have more power.

So expect massive disinformation campaigns to convince people to vote against such a thing.  Concocted crises, exploiting racial tensions, all sorts of FUD on how UBI will destroy everything.  How the people who can't find a job just need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.  Basically just all the republican talking points dialed up to 11.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">"Larry? Yeah, sorry to call off-hours but I think I've got a real live one. *Total* leftist-in-denial. They made it all the way to a Capstone project and they're still trying to assign blame for the ills they're perceiving to inanimate technology products, individual companies, or specific business processes. If any of your guys have capacity I *definitely* think we could get this guy to realize that what he's really opposing, what his personal ideals really stand in defiance of, are the fundamental principles of labor exploitation and capital accumulation upon which global capitalism was founded and continues to rely."

\&gt; No matter how efficient a company is, it still needs people who can afford its products.

Too true. You know who doesn't actually give a flying fuck about that? The owners and executives of that company. They will see the end coming *long* before it crashes and by the time the lights go out they will have loaded their booty up into a bunch of nice tidy sacks so they can carry it with them to their next "business opportunity."

Let go of the idea that wealthy people care about whether or not a company has long term viability. If it does, that's fine for them - they certainly don't mind. It makes things a little more convenient. But if it doesn't, they absolutely *do not fucking care*. Some of the wealthiest people in the world got to where they are by jumping from one spectacular failure of a company to another. Because, again, despite what they will tell you, being an owner or executive of a company under capitalism doesn't actually come with any actual risk. If you fuck up and sink the ship you're on, a lifeboat will be right there waiting to ferry you to your next gamble.

Your problem is not with AI (or cod fishing surely). It is with the economic system under which these industries exist.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Interesting. A \*potential\* tragedy of the commons.  The dynamic nature of the 'commons' in this case accelerates the tragedy.

That said, it's not the only thing the race is doing. Other potential developments: economic abundance (post-scarcity economy), unprecedented scientific and medical progress, enhanced human life and creativity. 

How do you get abundance in a massive-unemployment scenario? By severing the link between labor and consumption: (1) collapse of production costs and (2) channeling added value through a universal dividend. Result: shared prosperity.

Balance it all out, and whether the future is utopian or dystopian is unknowable.</div>

I went in and saw people kipping, climbing ropes, laying on the floor panting, etc. (It was a Saturday open gym day.) I met the coach and I’ve been going there ever since. I only went because I wanted to get my high blood work numbers down.

Fast forward to last week. My family and I were on vacation and my five year old fell asleep in the van. Dead weight.

But, if he did rape a young girl, he should be in prison too. 

Like everyone else who did.</div>

This is pretty common in Canada too. I know someone like this and hearing them spew the mental gymnastics to come to the conclusion the dealer is giving them a good deal is pretty crazy.

A friend is a manager at a dealership as well and hearing the stories from them of people just walking in and asking to trade in with thousands owing still completely blows my mind.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Weird fact: in ancient Buddhist practice, there's a technique called Aṣubha Bhāvanā — “meditation on the foul.” Monks would sit in charnel grounds, calmly meditating while watching bodies decay, to reflect on death and detach from desire.

It’s grim, but the goal was deep acceptance of impermanence.

Anyone heard of other wild meditation practices?

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;incentivized not to have children.

Literally the opposite of the message coming from the top. People are being urgently prodded to have more kids as they fan fears of underpopulation. By extension, tying your tubes is seen as literally evil outside of liberal circles.

Where in the world is anyone hearing to stop having kids?

That said, plenty of media is pushing back against UBI as a welfare queen's wet dream. Is that the part you meant? But when push comes to shove, is that message gonna matter when it's the only solution? Billionaires pushed for child labor. Despite some examples leaking through the cracks, how's that working out for them? I'm sure we can find more examples where billionaires don't really matter when it comes to masses of people affecting change in spite of them.</div>

If everyone who is currently dependent on selling their labour to live loses opportunity to continue doing that then they will *burn those cities to the ground,* along with the opera houses, bars and restaurants they contain.

The AI oligarchs can survive miserably in their bunkers while we starve, or they can live lives of unimaginable excess by giving up a small percentage of their wealth to fund UBI for the rest of us. Which would you choose?</div>

They can use robots to stop people from burning the cities to the ground, can't they?

And they don't need the other people to be able to go to opera, eat in restaurants and so on... robots can do all of that.</div>

I stumbled on an article 5 months ago where he claimed that, 3-6 months from now, AI would be writing 90% of all code. We only have one month to go to evaluate his prediction.

https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-ceo-ai-90-percent-code-3-to-6-months-2025-3

How far are we from his prediction? Is AI writing even 50% of code?

The AI2027 people indirectly based most of their predictions on Dario's predictions.</div>

AI is evolving incredibly fast, and robots are nearing their "iPhone moment", the point when they become widely useful and accessible. However, I don't think this breakthrough will initially come through advanced humanoid robots, as they're still too expensive and not yet practical enough for most households. Instead, our first widespread AI interactions are likely to be with affordable and approachable social robots like this one.

I really want this thing to not just be a commercial success, but to also have an overall positive impact.

I think the main use case will be a physical interface for chatGPT (or another AI). But I'm more excited about using this platform for teaching robotics/engineering/programming.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thanks! The sounds and movements were made by my colleagues, some of the emotions are really on point!

What we do is we give the AI the list of emotion names and descriptions, for example:  
  
yes\_sad1 -&gt; A melancholic “yes”. Can also be used when someone repeats something you already knew, or a resigned agreement.

amazed1 -&gt; When you discover something extraordinary. It could be a new robot, or someone tells you you've been programmed with new abilities. It can also be when you admire what someone has done.

  
So these descriptions are quite "oriented". The LLM also has a prompt that gives the robot its "personality".</div>

I was getting the runaround from the state Department of Transportation about getting a handicapped parking placard. I went to the office of the state representative for my district, and she made that shit happen. I received my placard in the mail within two weeks.

I got a nasty letter from one of Musk's goons earlier this year, trying to claw back survivor benefits from an orphan in my care. Long story, but they wanted me (on his behalf) to "repay" several thousand dollars he had never actually received because DOGE dodos apparently struggle to follow a name change. Anyway, I called my congresswoman, her office got them off my back within a week. Though I did get another letter from the social security office telling me that it was inappropriate to involve my rep, and I should have dealt with them directly 🙄</div>
