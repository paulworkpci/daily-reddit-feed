She's extremely uneducated but I'd be willing to bet she's one of the few elected GOP officials who actually does care about this issue. It's almost endearing.  

Mace is a narcissist, tried to make the closed meeting with the victims yesterday about herself. Bobo is surprised she's even still in office and working hard to remain relevant.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You can monitor your Codex usage, but unfortunately there isn't a plug-and-play extension like the Claude usage widget.

Some things you can try:
- The OpenAI dashboard's Usage page shows your daily and monthly token counts broken down by product. If you're on the Pro plan, it's under your account Settings &gt; Usage.
- When you call the API directly, the JSON response includes a `usage` field with `prompt_tokens` and `completion_tokens`. You can wrap the CLI or SDK call in a script to log those numbers.
- Alternatively, you can generate per request logs by passing `--log-level=debug` or enabling verbose output; the CLI will print token counts after each call.

These approaches aren't as polished as an in-app meter, but they let you keep an eye on consumption.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think he has spent decades now living in a consequence-free world. He can say and do whatever he wants and he can always talk himself out of it, he can always convince people that he didn’t do or say the thing he just did. His supporters will buy it every single fucking time. 

But this time it feels slightly different, like he’s gotten to the ledge and realized if the files are released, he might not be able to talk his way out of it. 

On the campaign trail the Epstein thing was just a tool to use to bludgeon his opponents. He can just say “X democrat is a pedophile and on the Epstein list!” No proof needed. 

The Epstein files weren’t real to him then but they’re real now and he’s freaking out.</div>

You will notice the amount of Epstein in the zeitgeist exploded when Trump started to soften on Ukraine and cold shoulder Russia. So they turn up the heat on Twitter etc... and its got its own legs now of course. 

Trump hasn't figured out how to walk this line yet. His most hard-core people are in a cult. He will lose more power as the mid terms approach and will take more drastic actions to hold power. A few "true believers" who aren't under Russian control will poke their heads up to try to take the new mantle. Infighting will destroy the movement.</div>

These demos seem cool, but uninspiring. Because in reality these will be used in agriculture and manufacturing.</div>

You're just sitting there, doing absolutely nothing…
…except fighting your inner demons, replaying every awkward moment since 2007, trying to focus on your breath while your brain reminds you of that one time you waved back at someone who wasn’t waving at you.

But somehow... 

In between all that chaos,
there’s this tiny space of silence.
That apace between the thoughts, which at first feels so alien, so unfamiliar, even terrifying...

                        <div class="comment-body">As someone who is a voice hearer, probably the very largest thing I deal with, seeing as I do talk to them like people for various reasons, I have this way of just generally looking out into the distance remembering exactly what I would not be saying in this moment to a degree of such simplicity that it looks like I'm saying it. 

Thankfully, processes run in tandem and I generally have a lot of ways remaining balanced and occupied, I don't have to worry about it at this point in my life but it can make the waters more choppy. The fact that it's actually funny and stimulating is something I would attribute to the success I have actually had cuz I got my mind on quite the chain nowadays. I learned to keep energy moving and balanced, after that it was quite easy and I continuously have good energetic development.

Realistically what will actually happen in my meditations when I feel well is it'll be like I have an underlying flowing river of different priorities and positive things, I'm accustomed to feeling blissful for extended hours and all that, but it's as if when I am feeling a little off due to one reason or another, rather than worrying which is something I can actually feel when I have healing symptoms from doing yoga, instead I just kinda remember various things I would not do. 

Realistically I wouldn't actually consider it a primary issue, mainly a secondary one. Like one day when I'm way WAY along with my progress rather than just way along then it's more natural to spend time that's peaceful enough that I may as well actually stop caring what thought comes out and play around with that.

It's like little issues can build up and create tendencies, secondary issues. It's still funny tho and I didn't really actually have a teacher beyond my own damn common sense at that rate to really grasp fundamentally what should or should not concern me. Basically my mind has room to think, because I like it, it can get a bit off topic if I don't feel quite right, but since it's also focused on other tasks that go in tandem, naturally per heartbeat I have a certain amount of stuff I can get away with while maintaining balance which is totally fine. 

My main goal when I started was to have and stay within loving thoughts and feelings rather than flipped up human membrane sandwiches of pain and doubt. Essentially, the body constantly expresses life force, if I want I can purposefully go have my expressions and leave room for my mind to express what it means if need be or I can prioritize having more of a talk, more or less relaxation. Basically I want my mind to be abundantly funny and pretty, a lot of the progress I need now actually has to do with having thoughts with more potential for more engaging humor.

If I wanted to and my energy allowed I could just kinda chill in there all day mostly blissful. Thing is my energy is still in this way, before it was easier to mostly escape suffering but for now even if I could be blissful more like before it's like having a system that builds up until it hits friction cuz the energy don't wanna fit quite right. Like, one pointed attention could actually persistently create burning pain and actually easily bring in emotions which aren't especially balanced like a very encompassing default, and that's my own fault as per the methods I used and my reasons for doing so. I'm not even sure how well I could actually move from it, in fact to me it's like being stuck with emotions which get real energized, stuck, charged up, then release in a way which makes my experience feel less still and quiet. This is normal for a lot of people in a lot of cases but to some extent it could be much easier for them, I also happen to have a lot of reasons why my mind veers towards activity. 

That being said, it gets better all the time, I have plenty of reasons to be hopeful. I think the trick here for me may actually be that changing my lifestyle is what would have my healing process finish up but even then I don't think I need to and, you know, gosh, maybe I'm missing just a bit here and there, what I care for about my experiences, things are just getting so nitty gritty, I think what I have is plentiful and I can see why and I'd like for it to finish so I can show other people too. More specifically. 

Technically I already opened my major chakras, it was just the way I did it was very abnormal and painful so it started off in no-man's-land. 

It's true that I did start having psychic experiences with these voices, I refer to them as spirits, but much like a certain population of people I really started out with it in a way which wasn't obvious and in my heart it is still like I am doing as that version of me would if someone told him how to do it. Voice hearing can be challenging.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I wonder how many people might have said they're not exactly sure what their big problem is.

I was just thinking about how there are different ways energy can distribute depending on what kind of perspective you use, like there is this specific feeling which is that of having a part of you looking down a melancholy tunnel, as if what you're thinking and doing is leading somewhere, on its own it's not much different than other ways of generally distributing emotional resources but the thing about it is people can get stuck in it BECAUSE their emotions don't feel actively engaging and exciting yet, or at least not enough.

Think like if you were to look to your experience for something to say to someone and have it then look to the experience again, like a feedback loop. This is something that does not require talking to someone else and when you are engaged with emotions with this kind of feedback loop it is actually very balancing in and of itself, it's just another way of focusing, like caring about your emotions. You care about them such that as you are aware of them they make useful experiences that can branch together and lead somewhere new and better, like a journey.

This kind of feeling can actually get stuck off so much that someone could start feeling it and wonder what it is and actually get distracted because of how stuck it can get. Understanding how to have processes run in tandem and simplifying things is really helpful when meditating and this kind of thing is like an openness, it is like accepting things, but it can be like you saturate in action potential as well and it can feel like brimming with interconnection and energy more. To me, this feels really natural. I literally speak within these boundaries and naturally I would think, what makes it unique? As it turns out, not a whole lot. So many different things can be reliably created by the imagination in proper circumstances it's actually literally funny. There are interesting visceral feelings you can get when in this open introspection with yourself in ways that I only really know how to call surreal, but it has to do with the feedback loop. Like it makes you feel funny and as you have a thought with yourself it could be like you're having a thought to someone else too. 

There's just this genuine part of the process where someone can learn how to keep energy circulating and keep the passion going, I think there could be very innovative ways to make this click for a lot of people so spiritual progress feels more like spamming the B button and then you win. Right action and just good values obviously matter for the right kinds of feedback going on.

I'm getting harassed by a strange bug that's like a circle.

That was interesting, actually jeeze it's really chasing me, I've accidentally hit it a few times and everything and it's like it wants to sniff me very directly. Never seen a bug quite like this, not that I can remember. Maybe it's young and dumb. 

However, I am a fan of this kind of advice, it could just be another one of those ways my spirits get all "Involved". I mean that lightheartedly of course. Bugs have been involved in a few different striking ways before so 🤪

It's the dumb things... The dumb little things...</div>

It's going to be somewhat polarised I feel - some people will basically abdicate any agency and use AI to outsource all their coding, and some other will be smart enough to still do the learning and doing bit and then magnify their impact by leveraging coding co-pilots and agents. 
OpenAI and Anthropic will make money either way (less sure about Cursor, Lovable and Replit).</div>

I gave up on using aider/claude code other CLI tools months ago, as I was burning through €70+ in credits just in one evening's coding.

Codex running with my ChatGPT Plus plan €20 per month (and not the OpenAI credits) is the big gamechanger for me.

(btw what \*are\* the limits?  I've been using it on medium and feels unlimited? Not sure how to check if I'm approaching a limit or not. Is there a way to check my limit?)

(and anyone have any MCP recommendations to use with it? Seems very capable as-is)</div>

I figured out the secret (for me)—I tell my wife the task/metric/goal I have to hit and when I need to hit it by. Sometimes I’ll tell her what I’d like my reward to be (ie: check out that show I’ve been hearing about, take a nap on Saturday, etc) and sometimes she’ll choose a reward for me (some examples: long day, so she tells me to crash in the other room while she gets the kids ready for bed—I just come in and read to them after a 10-15 min break vs cleaning teeth, changing, etc)

She holds me accountable and it definitely gets me locked in/focused</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You guys are way behind on this lol. This is already sort of happening although not but humanoid robots.

There are already mine sites where big operations are running trucks that are either fully or partly autonomous. In the oil sands, those 400-ton Cat and Komatsu dump trucks are completely self-driving now at couple of mine sites.

Before, each truck needed two drivers on 12-hour shifts to cover a full day. Now with autonomy, there’s no downtime for shift changes, bathroom breaks, lunch, or operator mistakes. The trucks just keep moving around the clock, way more efficient.

Each driver used to cost about $200k to $250k a year. Companies save that salary and cut all the extras too. No more workplace insurance, pensions, benefits, camp housing and meals, flights, shuttles, or rental cars.

When one person can monitor ten trucks instead of driving one, the ripple effect is huge. Fewer drivers means less camp staff, fewer shuttle drivers, fewer HR people, fewer payroll staff. It all adds up.

At first, retrofitting a truck with autonomous systems cost about a million dollars. It was rough getting the technology working, but now it runs pretty smoothly and more sites are making the switch.

Support equipment like dozers, excavators, shovels, and graders will take longer. There are too many variables to automate those right now, while trucks just go from point A to point B and dump.

The future is in the trades, at least for now. Electricians and mechanics will always be needed to fix things when they break. Until robots can crawl under a dozer that just came out of muskeg and swap out a starter, humans are still required.

What I think will happen is machines will be designed in a modular way. Everything will be a box you unbolt and replace. That part will be shipped off to China for refurbishing instead of paying a tech $80 an hour to do it in the shop.</div>

I mean real or fake it was loud no? if I rev my engine at a stoplight or if I have speakers on the exterior playing loud revving exhaust sounds what's the functional difference? 

&gt; but then arguably goes too far when stock vehicles are being cited as nuisances

I don't think its too far, a 911.2 GT3 with the valves open is an incredibly loud car and will be cited under nyc law at full bore, and I say this as someone who owned a 911.2 GT3, I felt it was reasonable enough to keep the valves closed in the city

I mean I find it really odd that Minnesota just bans "excessive or unusual noise" altogether instead of stating some objective limit, I feel like thats ripe for abuse, but I don't live there for a reason

Cali does 95dba which is pretty reasonable I think. NYC does 76 &amp; 82 for under/over 35mph but there isn't a reason to get above that in the city anyways</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Dead internet is inevitable because too many parties benefit from fake online voices and AI.

Perfect for spreading propaganda through social media. You want something to become normalized? Just have hundreds of thousands of bots post about how that thing should be normal. 

Want to sell your product? Just have thousands of bots all talking about how incredible your product is. Flood the internet with fake ranking websites that place your product at the top. Create hundreds of fake blogs all raving about your product. Send your bots to those sites and suddenly it's the first thing search engines suggest.

Wages in your country not good enough to survive? Create thousands of bots in video games to collect and sell currency to players who don't want to grind. Have AI create YouTube videos for ad revenue. 

Want to be famous? Purchase a ton of bots to follow you on social media. Then have more bots go around and mention you every possible chance they get. Now you have inflated following from the bots and you gain more and more as they convince others to follow you.</div>
