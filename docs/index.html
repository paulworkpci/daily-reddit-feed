                <div class="post-content"># Welcome to the 9th annual Singularity Predictions at [r/Singularity](https://www.reddit.com/r/Singularity/).

In this annual thread, we have reflected on our previously held estimates for AGI, ASI, and the Singularity, and updated them with new predictions for the year to come. This tradition is always growing - just two years ago, we added the concept of "proto-AGI" to our list. This year, I ask that we consider some of the new step-based AGI ideas to our predictions. That is, **DeepMind and ...</div>

1b) AGI: 2025
2) ASI: 2027
3) Singularity: 2030

Reasoning: Gemini-1206 is more intellectually capable than anyone I know, functionally. But it isn't agentic, does not have Internet access, etc. So it's functionally a fraction of what AGI will be capable of. 

AGI will be here as soon as we have reliable agents, and we'll have some model updates by then, too - possibly 3 to 4 next year from what OpenAI's people are saying. 

With that pace of scaling, and similar enthusiasm from Google, and things like Deepseek from China, it's hard to think things won't keep accelerating, and AI might be entirely beyond us at a whole different level by 27-29.

Singularity is pretty hard to predict. ASI will massively accelerate things, but what's it take for life to feel unrecognizable to us, as something we could have predicted? But I think by 2030 we'll have near universal job loss, humanoid robots better than us at every task, and (at least aside from regulatory hurdles) have begun to reverse aging/start on longevity escape velocity.</div>

By Jan 2027, six months may be completely unpredictable.  By 2030, the next day may be unpredictable.  I can't predict, because I'm already in the singularity.

Holy moly, this is classic r/singularity uber-optimism right here. I don't believe that any of this will pan out by 2030, even for a second, but we'll see. Humanoid robots being better at us at everything in 5 years when they currently are almost entirely useless is the hardest thing to believe here.</div>

Less facetiously, I believe if 2023-2024 were the years AI mastered language and reasoning, 2025-2026 will be the years of Agents and integration. And those agents, which can *autonomously* execute on real-life actionable plans, people will call AGI. Hence my flair.</div>

Scaling of these systems with test-time compute could still structurally be subhuman.

AI has already been used for a long time to assist in research, hell, you could count every single Google search used in a research setting as being "assisted by AI" since Google searches are using lots of AI algorithms.

If AI become smart enough to considerably accelerate AI research then yes I agree, that's all that matters -- because that acceleration would lead to new discoveries allowing the acceleration to go parabolic</div>

This isn’t quite true when accounting for time spent commuting, cooking, children and physical activity. This dominoes into the health issues and obesity epidemic we started developing in the 1990s. 

The larger the population is the less time you have for yourself. America is pretty much at peak at this point.. nothing is a quick run anymore and decision fatigue kicks in just doing errands. 

This also leads into why door dashing and online grocery shopping is becoming extremely popular.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed.  What’s frightening is that my daughters, 24 and 14, are vehemently opposed to ever having children after watching me try to keep up with my job and raise their 3 year old brother.  This even with their dad and I still together and are probably what many would consider high-ish earners.  

Breaks my heart that they are leaning so far toward not having children, I know anything can happen down the road but I always knew I’d be a mother, from a little girl playing with cabbage patch dolls.  The appeal is waning due to the overall burden of trying to keep up with it all.</div>

I can get consistently good results from the tools mentioned above, but Sora is absolutely horrendous for a flagship video generation tool. How is that even possible?

Veo2 being superior is understandable since Google has a lot of resources, training compute, money. But I doubt Kling and Pika devs have as much resources to train their models compared to OpenAI.

How?</div>

Yeah, and episode #69 is equally wild and multiple people, me included, shared it on the r/UFOs sub.

Nobody noticed.

/Edit: since this is the highest up voted comment so far, I'd like to add: This entire podcast sounds like a sales pitch to the 0.01%

Pay close attention to the economy focused language. It's no coincidence.

I'd also like to add that in episode #69 they talk about reverse engineering like a topic of mundane office talk.

I was working on a program for the Department of Defense, nothing fancy or classified. It was a contract with the US Navy.

At some point, the DOD funding evaported. My boss sat me down, and I could tell he was nervous that I'd fucked things up and that's what led to the funding to NOT be renewed. (They didn't cancel the project - they just stopped funding.)

After a bit of investigation on his end, his 'best guess' was that the project had landed at the newly created "Space Force." Space Force has a lot of projects, here is one: https://www.spaceforce.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Fact-Sheet-Display/Article/3743383/3rd-space-operations-squadron/

---

Within months, all the disclosure stuff started, the Tic Tac videos covered by the NYT, etc.

The entire time, my gut reaction was *"I wonder if this is the Space Force and the Navy having a pissing contest over who gets to continue the UAP project?"*

In another weird twist, the majority of the hangars used by that part of the Navy, they began evaluating other uses for the property. Almost like whatever they were working on wound up being worked on by a different agency.

Obviously, all of this is unclassified and I am engaging in speculation. I am not claiming that this is what happened behind the scenes; we were never told.

https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/redevelopment-of-old-town-navwar-facility-moves-ahead/

*"“The Navy’s enduring partnerships with the City of San Diego and surrounding communities are essential to this successful initiative moving forward,” Rear Admiral Brad Rosen, Commander of Navy Region Southwest, said in a statement.*

**Considered the Navy’s largest leasing initiative, the transaction aims to transfer some 5,000 cybersecurity professionals out of the outdated World War II-era factory facilities currently housing NAVWAR."**

I am obviously not UFOanon, but here's what he wrote 18 months ago:

&gt;what role do you think space force will play in disclosure moving forward?

Openly stated to us discovery for internal use and disinformation to the public.

&gt;What can we as a populace do to encourage your bosses to lighten up?

This has always been on my mind. I think if we convinced another nation like China or Russia to come out the US would have to come out as well.
I think having the USAF release their footage was a way to jumpstart Space X in a way.

&gt;the pentagon has already reported that the legit UAPs are "off-world vehicles not made on this earth" while OP is claiming they are made in a facility in the oceans.

I stated multiple times we've seen them come and go from the planet. We suspect the construction facility is capable of space travel as well.

&gt;He also stated that they were all unmanned

Reading comprehension issue. I said most of them are unmanned today. This is not strictly the case and in prior years we dealt with piloted craft quite often.

&gt;people with security clearances that large don't just get on 4chan to spill the beans

You're not wrong and if it makes you feel better watching my internet take a shit last night made me panic a bit if I'm being honest.

I could have just ignored your post too.

&gt;that allow various agencies to give him free access

I do not have free access to everything. Visiting crash sites comes with a lot of information by default though.

&gt;providing zero evidence towards his claim. Also the burden of proof fallacy

Was I supposed to steal data from work and post it freely here? How about a copy of my clearance or work badge? Yes, Anon let me just out myself completely.

&gt;Ok so Element E115 provide the weak gravity field and the engine amplify the phenom through resonance?

The gravity field remains the same for E115 but the output from the engine produces almost all of the gravity used for travel.

                        <div class="comment-body">Justin Bieber’s “Where Are Ü Now” music video features a stop-motion style with rapidly flashing frames, supposedly drawn by fans during an art show.

 The video contains overt negative subliminals, and revisiting it in the context of P. Diddy’s situation and his connections to Bieber reveals some disturbing connections. 

Keep in mind, this is just my personal, cracked-out theory. I’m aware artists typically don’t create their own videos, and there’s limited evidence that subliminals have a real impact. Even when I try to look at it rationally, I can’t explain why some of this stuff would be included for the video. 

Here’s my breakdown of the symbolism, I’ll go through in the same order they appear in my post. This is not the same order they appear in the original video.

Starting with the first frame, it’s the only frame in the entire video that appears twice—once at the beginning and again toward the end, which I found curious. This frame features a “menu” with phrases like “$5 to look at it, $10 to watch me touch it, $15 for you to touch it,” along with disturbing text such as “Hand jobs for God,” “Love the devil back,” and “Kill the poor.” It also includes an upside-down cross on his forehead.

The second frame shows Justin covered in a substance that strongly resembles semen, though some may argue it’s just white paint. The added text, “TROY was here,” raises further concerns.

The third frame features a childlike drawing of spirals emanating from Justin. It also includes six square boxes, three of which stand out. The box in the lower right, with a stick figure saying “I love Biebs,” displays the letter “P.” The box directly above shows the text “nis” which I can only interpret as “I love Biebs Penis”. The box in the upper left displays a spiral symbol, which, according to an unclassified FBI Intelligence Bulletin, is said to represent “little boy love.” I understand that not every spiral is necessarily related to this but given the context, it’s sus.

The fourth frame is particularly intriguing, as it appears to be coded, though its meaning remains unclear. It features a larger spiral with two stars above it and waves at the top. The text includes “planetary,” “put hands up,” and what seems to be either “SUREYNOTE” or “SURFYNOTE.” It also displays the numbers “819,” “327,” “715,” “214,” and “423.” 

The fifth frame shows Justin as an angel with horns. Rather than a traditional halo, the angel’s is a slice of pizza, with the wings also made of pizza. There’s hidden text in this frame, though I had trouble making it out. While I know not everything involving pizza is a conspiracy, given the context of the other frames, it’s certainly odd.

The sixth frame once again features an upside-down cross on Justin’s forehead, with the text “Blood Fu Death Cult” on his shirt. He has blood on his mouth, with two birds to his right and what appears to be a cursed monkey’s paw on his left.

The seventh frame shows Justin covered in blood, walking away from a dead or dying dog, with the text “He was un good dog”

The rest of the frames are more straightforward, but the inclusion of such disturbing messaging raises an important question: why include these elements at all? 

The sheer amount of detail packed into these frames and the intentional speed at which they flash makes it difficult to believe this is all random or accidental. The question then becomes: why? What is the purpose of embedding these disturbing, often cryptic images into a music video? 

Here’s my theory: certain individuals, possibly P. Diddy or others with influence in the entertainment industry, may have embedded hidden messages in Justin Bieber’s videos as coded communication—essentially “shopping” him around to potential abusers or those with ill intent. These subliminal messages and unsettling symbols might act as signals to those “in the know,” subtly conveying availability, vulnerability, or control.

While I may be reaching, it’s my first original theory, and I can’t help but feel I might be onto something here. It could just be an over-interpretation or maybe something much darker. Lmk if i’m crazy.</div>

After my grandmother died I asked people to take her comforter to the cleaners, asked her neighbor to pick up her newspaper, asked someone else if they could research where to donate something she owned and was told no by all 3.  I've run across this at almost every major event.  Don't say it if you don't mean it!  

If you DO mean it, be specific.  I'm here if you need to talk.  I have a truck if you need to haul things. I have a shower seat you can borrow.  Stuff like that.</div>

I have used the phrase "if there's anything I can do, please let me know" many times, and I meant it each and every times. If I had received a call to go pick up toothpaste, I'd be out the door.

Not everyone just says the phrase, some of us actually do mean it.</div>

They are probably trying to take it even further and create an environment where that is normal and people have their real friends online, but also their AI friends, and they prefer and interact more with their AI friends. Then those AI friends can be used to manipulate them politically and economically. So it's a very good idea from a megalomaniacal, psychotic, business perspective.</div>

Of course it will never pass, a politician has to vote for it and pass it, and it doesn’t benefit them in any way at all. It would remove some of the ways corruption occurs, but not all. And even if it did pass, what would stop them from using a relative or someone they trust to use the insider information to make money in that persons name to get back to them.</div>

I will say though that AI and modern events generally impact far more of the people on the planet. If everyone in England in 500AD were vaporized by aliens, that wouldn't have had that much impact, though today it would be world shattering. Prior to the invention of the radio, the only event that would have been impactful globally all at one would be the volcano in 536.

I'll add 1962 to your modern ones though. Nearly had a global nuclear war.... so i imagine it was very 'interesting'.</div>

People don't remember the drastically better aircraft made *just* after the Wright brothers that led up to military level aircraft in WW1.  Or postwar improvements that led to miracles of performance like the Spitfire and the pinnacle (of piston engine prop aircraft perf) like the F4U Corsair and the Bearcat and P-38 Lightning. They remember Wright brothers, the German jet fighters, Chuck Yeager, first 747 flights, SR-71.  Where, arguably, the SR-71 was the end of the exponential improvement curve - the improvements since then have been modest and mostly in the realm of improved reliability and fuel efficiency.</div>

I think social media usage/excess screen time has made my life significantly less interesting. I have similar goals to you: I want to be more present in 2025 and live my life in a more fulfilling way. Thanks for your post! :) 

I deleted my IG app and I am only letting myself check it at most once a week for my messages. I checked it today after deleting it on Friday and I found much less interest in it. Feels so good to not doom-scroll through it and I realized how much time I actually have when I’m not wasting it. I feel more peaceful too and consistently looking for other outlets or healthy ways to keep busy.</div>

Whether we can do anything to prepare about it is yet to be seen, but a report and prediction gets non-tech people more aware of the potential  consequences. I think we're at 99.9% automation in 20 years, but I'll take between 50-99% as useful predictions at this point.</div>

I believe that 47% of today's jobs (assuming no adaptation) could face automation within 5-7 years.

Perhaps, if we exclude a hard takeoff, they will simply evolve into other roles and/or adapt to the new environment.</div>

Not happening. This subreddit wildy underestimates how difficult it is to replace jobs wholesale, let alone 47%. There is no scenario where 47% of jobs will have been automated by 2031/2032.</div>

Every technology we had needed humans to develop and adapt the systems, and most importantly it cost a lot of money and time. If we get dirt cheap intelligence comparable to humans, which is very soon, I would argue the adpation rate will be faster than ever? It would be just like hiring brunch of workers with really cheap price and the onboarding training time should be much less.</div>

The second thing I want to ask is a bit more personal I'm not going to college well I was but not currently, and I don't want to be caught on the bad side of either option what would be the best path for me to take given both scenarios?

We humans consider ourselves to have GI (some of us at least...), and we can see many examples of when we nearly extincted ourselves, through accident or recklessness. No reason to think AGI wouldn't/couldn't run the same risks, maybe moreso. I'd kind of be ok with it if biological life went extinct as long as intelligence lived on in some form. But if **everything** dies? Man. That's just... the most disappointing anticlimax I can think of.</div>

Even a kind of FDVR "Utopia" could lead to dystopia and outcomes far worse than death.


Never forget that as far as we're aware, death is just an end. Living "forever" could be extremely worse than death. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Go to college. It will either be helpful, or not, but in the event something happens to AGI and it’s not possible it gives you a future. Assuming AGI happens then it either doesn’t matter because UBI/immortality/robots, or doesn’t matter because…. You know…

So given that one way it’s a huge plus, and the other it’s a moot point, never negative, go to college.

Edit: I kept thinking… if it’s a huge financial stress to go to college, maybe consider cheaper ones, I probably wouldn’t recommend Ivy League to anyone these days.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Completely agree. It’s a kind of Pascal’s wager. It is completely possible to have a fulfilling life in our current system without a college degree, but on average people with degrees are better off than those without. Plus, college is fun. If ASI doesn’t pan out during the course of your lifetime, you’ll likely be better off with a degree. And if it does pan out, it’s unlikely a degree will make your situation worse. </div>

Then something clicked. I realized I was focusing too much on the end result and not enough on the small, daily steps that actually get you there.

                                <div class="reply-body">Atomic habits is about building habits (duh!). The key point of this post, I believe, is that it's crucial to break down goals into small manageable pieces. 

And I think it's far more important!

This includes breaking it down into baby steps and putting in the work every day (consistency), even if showing up is the most you can do.

BTW, give NotebookLM a try. You can upload any book (or document) and generate an AI deep-dive podcast. You can boil down a 5 day read into a 15 minute audio :)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thank you so much! 😊 The thing I’m most proud of is learning how to stay consistent, even on days when I didn’t feel motivated. That small shift completely changed how I approach goals. What surprised me the most was realizing that progress doesn’t have to be perfect—it just has to be steady. Small, consistent actions truly add up over time!</div>

One guy is so emotional because he won or because he lost, the other guy is just numb because he lost or just won. Who knows lol.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">They were playing an end game of Blitz chess (3 minutes total time with 2 seconds added per move) with only seconds left on their clocks. Old guy was in a winning position meaning if he plays it out perfectly he will win. However, before that he makes a few inaccuracies/blunders and now his opponent is in a winning position instead. But before it gets played out his clock runs out so he automatically loses, called “flagging” in chess. This loss basically assured him an exit from the tournament.
