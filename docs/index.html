Anyone thinking that just one of the parties has dirty laundry is naïve to say the least. And this has nothing to do with current politics, this been happening for decades so unless this person selectively exposes a few things here and there to come down on one side of the political spectrum, nothing will come from this.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The Republicans only started talking about the Deep State when they thought they lost control of it when Barack Obama was elected president.

You will never hear about how Allen Dulles was the head of the CIA while his brother John Foster Dulles was the Secretary of State. Or how their grandfather was Secretary of State John Dulles. Or how his brother in law was Secretary of State Robert Lansing.

How many American families can boast of having THREE men who became Secretary of State?

The Deep State is responsible for a century of American imperialism in Latin America.</div>

It's textbook and it boggles my mind that half of Americans are so dumb as to believe that this particular group of kleptocrat ghouls have anything other than enslavement of the untermensch in mind.
The other half should seriously start doing that armed militia thing which the founders of the nation were so adamant about, with this specific set of events in mind.</div>

Hi, 31f here with an insane amount of chaos in my life. 

I work full time as a mental health therapist, I have adhd and autism, I have 3 kids who are all neurodivergent, a spouse that’s neurodivergent and I care for my elderly parents (mom has Alzheimer’s). All of this to say I am just as fuck. 

So after work, I give my kids quick meals and then head over to my parents house to help them out. 

I get home late then eat pizza or take out or any other trash food, put the kids to bed and then cr...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You are carrying an unimaginable weight, and yet, every single day, you keep going. That is strength. That is love. That is resilience. You are not failing, you are navigating an impossible situation with everything you have, and that is extraordinary.

I know it feels like there’s no space left for you in your own life, but you matter. Your health, your well-being, your peace, all of it matters just as much as everyone else’s. And you don’t have to fix everything overnight. Start small. Swap one meal for something a little more nourishing. Move your body in a way that feels doable, even for five minutes. Let something go, one thing, even if it’s just the guilt for not being able to do it all.

You were never meant to carry all of this alone. If there’s any way to ask for help, even in the smallest way, take it. If there’s any way to be kinder to yourself, choose it. You deserve that. You deserve rest, care, and a life that gives back to you, too.</div>

E.g. drone surveillance l, digital surveillance, wire tapping etc. I think they're using intelligence in the espionage/surveillance sense rather than the biological sense. Especially given the next sentence is "or impair the effectiveness of an intelligence **method** currently in use" methods aren't biologically intelligent in any sense so the only context in which that sentence makes sense is if intelligence is being used in that following sentence in the espionage/surveillance sense.</div>

I think there's a definite possibility that they are referring to nonhuman collection methods (i.e. SIGINT, GEOINT, etc) and not "NHI". I'm sure if this report was written today and they wanted to convey that, they would not use the term nonhuman. I feel like NHI wasn't really that common of a term in 2012.</div>

He loves to buy things on Amazon. His opinions are not original in the slightest and sometimes he said things which I recognized from when I was still reading news.

Lets not try and judge other people too much. Everyone has their own journeys and relationships with their smartphones and you can't control other people.</div>

Yeah, I am one of those sheep, and don't want to be, but all the grandpa rants have given me is scolding.


edit: I do think following news can turn into doomscrolling, but "check it only once a day and stay out of the comment section" is a more reasonable way to get a handle on that than carping about the evil MSM.</div>

I try to leave supportive and helpful comments but if I go in to a thread and it’s already chock full of venom, I usually just keep my mouth shut to avoid getting yelled at by somebody who’s already mad and is now extra mad that I’m not mad with them.

Btw, are you THE Pervocracy? Like, the blogger? If so, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart! When I was 16-18, your blog shaped my expectations and beliefs about consent and everything related to it. And that’s really good news because I was one of those catastrophically precocious girls who got surrounded by evil skeletons, like, four seconds after I stepped into high school. Thank you! My life would’ve been a lot worse for a lot longer if it weren’t for you!

If you’re not that person, sorry! You’ve got a sweetass username though.</div>

This particular post/thread is the most sane one I’ve seen in weeks.  I can’t tell (well We can’t tell anymore, usually) whether bots or not, but the guys (teens? Not sure) posting lately about the sickening disgusting morose Redditors is just wild.  Every word dripping with hatred for what is very clearly themselves, and it’s not even slightly concealed, other than from the poster themselves.  It’s sad but man I hope this can become a helpful place again.  Not another outlet of *manosphere “self improvement”* mental aesthetics.</div>

We can do both

He's correct on the structure of current education. Since the industrial revolution, it's been about effectively turning children/people into machine operators and system workers for production. Now that automation will increasingly fill those roles, the way forward is through instilling *how to learn* and to be able to quickly adapt to change. To be creative.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is why I always say - in these hypothetical situations when we say “if Obama did this the Republicans would be furious” - it’s important to end that sentence with “and they’d be right”.

So much of politics these days comes down to people needing to feel like they’re right, and automatically becoming defensive if they think someone is telling them they’re wrong. 

If we’re doing these hypotheticals and saying “this is how you’d feel”, we’d reach more people by saying “this is how you’d feel, and you’d be right to feel that way”. It also goes some way to showing “that’s why we are so outraged by this when it’s your guy doing it”.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">An important part of this is context, though. 

It's not just that President Trump is declaring himself king (arguably not jokingly). It's that this "joke" is far from a one off, but actually a repeated notion like the recent Napoleon quote. It's that he's also behaving like one - ignoring Court rulings, ignoring the Article I powers of the purse of Congress. It's the EOs that reach far beyond his authority. It's that the Congressional Republican majority is patting him on the back for doing so. He also constantly lavishes praise on dictators and said he'd be one on day one. And, you know, the whole coup attempt and pardon of those traitors.

So if Obama joked about it, I probably wouldn't care because the context surrounding that joke in no way would indicate he actually believed it and intended act in accordance with that belief.

I hate Bush's guts, but there are certainly contexts in which he could have made that joke that wouldn't have roiled me. Though, if it was in defense of his attempts at politicization of the DOJ, then yeah, I'd have had issues.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Let's put it this way

In the summer of 2015, the right was convinced that the US army had turned traitor, and sworn eternal allegiance to only Obama.

Obama was going to use only 2100 of these soldiers to invade, conquer, and occupy Texas (Pop 30 Million) like it was France, and turn it into the first part of the Obamunist Empire

The GOP believed this to the point that the Texas government ordered a partial mobilization of the Texas state guard to 'monitor' the US army.

At no point did Obama make any sort of joke or tweet about doing this.

EDIT, sorry, I got the number of troops wrong, it wasn't 2100, it was 1200.</div>

He never once hinted at that yet Trump and his minions have actually tried to get him a third term and its crickets from the right. Actually they support it.


They only care about the constitution when they are attacking the left. The right can do whatever they want.

The same as if they joked about loving young women with Epstein. 

The same as if they (especially Obama, you know why), had 7 kids with 3 women. 

The same as if they paid a porn star for sex while their wife was 8 months pregnant. 

The same as if they didn’t show up to the next presidents inauguration and instead held an insurrection. 

The same as if they admitted to grabbing women by the pussy because men in power are allowed.

                        <div class="comment-body">Microsoft engineers are currently readying server capacity for OpenAI’s upcoming GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 models, according to a source familiar with the company’s plans. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged recently that GPT-4.5 will launch within a matter of weeks, I understand that Microsoft is expecting to host the new AI model as early as next week.

Codenamed Orion, GPT-4.5 is OpenAI’s next frontier model and the company’s last non-chain-of-thought model. OpenAI has already teased that GPT-4.5 could be a lot more powerful than GPT-4, but the company is also looking ahead to its GPT-5 model that will include more significant changes.

I’m told that Microsoft is expecting GPT-5 in late May, which aligns with Altman’s promise of the next-gen model arriving within a matter of months. As always, this date could shift if release plans change. We reported in October that OpenAI was originally planning to release GPT-4.5 by the end of 2024, but this was subsequently delayed to early 2025.

GPT-5 will likely be the more significant release out of the pair, and Altman has referred to it as a “system that integrates a lot of our technology.” It also includes OpenAI’s new o3 reasoning model, which the company teased during its 12 days of Christmas announcements in December.

While OpenAI released o3-mini last month, OpenAI is no longer planning to ship o3 as a standalone model, and it will instead be integrated into this GPT-5 system. This aligns with OpenAI’s goal to combine its large language models to eventually create a more capable model that could be labeled as artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

This updated GPT-5 system will also include significant improvements to the way you use ChatGPT, unifying OpenAI’s o-series and GPT-series models to reduce some of the confusion of knowing which model to pick for which task or query. “We hate the model picker as much as you do and want to return to magic unified intelligence,” said Altman in a post on X recently.

If OpenAI manages to ship GPT-5 in time for late May, it would align well with Microsoft’s Build developer conference — which starts on May 19th and will go head-to-head with Google I/O that week. Altman appeared onstage at Microsoft Build last year, just days after OpenAI released GPT-4o as a faster model that was free for all ChatGPT users.

I reported last year that OpenAI’s GPT-4o release surprised some teams at Microsoft because it undermined Microsoft’s own paid-for AI services on Azure, which include speech and translation features. The GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 releases should come as less of a surprise, and I’m expecting the software maker to be ready with Copilot updates shortly after OpenAI’s latest launch. Microsoft gave Copilot a big redesign in October, just months after OpenAI released GPT-4o.

Much like OpenAI, Microsoft has also been working to improve Copilot’s model picker so that it’s easier for users to interact with the AI assistant without having to select the AI model powering those interactions. Microsoft used to have “creative,” “balanced,” and “precise” options to help control model output, but it scrapped those with the big Copilot overhaul last year. In January, Microsoft added a “Think Deeper” button that uses OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model to answer queries.

Microsoft is also working on its own version of OpenAI’s new Operator AI agent that can do things on the web for you. Operator can interact with GUIs on webpages, allowing it to automatically take action for you. It’s a similar concept to a macro that can automate tasks or an autopilot system on aircraft that doesn’t require constant attention from a human.

I’m expecting a host of AI announcements from Microsoft over the coming months, particularly at Build in May, where it gets to present its latest technology to the developers building AI apps and products. Microsoft has been focused heavily recently on the capabilities of its AI agents, and I’ve heard that teams have been trying to reduce the costs involved to make them even more appealing to businesses.

Microsoft Build and Google I/O also overlap this year, so expect to see both companies try to one-up each other on AI announcements — particularly with GPT-5 set to debut around the same time.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I am posting this to hold myself accountable. I believe I am struggling with social media addiction, especially ytube, sometimes spending up to 10 hours a day. It is making me feel worse and worse as the days go by. I feel like I am falling behind compared to my peers. I have so much to learn and do, so I am quitting all social media, including LinkedIn, and refraining from watching movies and listening to music. I will let you know the results of these changes.

wish me luck lol.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">i quit social media 2 years ago, i deleted instagram, tiktok, twitter, youtube from my phone but i kept the accounts just for when i need to check something (which its not usual). Also, what i did with youtube was that i paused the history (both)  so it couldnt give me recommendations in the homepage, and therefore i also had no youtube shorts. I still use pinterest sometimes and reddit but i dont find them as addicting, and whatsapp of course (if it counts).

You are going to get distracted anyway but with other stuff, dont think this is going to be a magical solution and you are automatically going to get disciplined. But it sure saves you A LOT of time and brainrotting.</div>

Not that you need any advice, but I recommend you make sure to focus on other things. I believe to remove a habit/behavior, you need to replace it with something else. So focus more on whatever you're passionate about and get more serious about it. 

  
Good luck! You're doing something great for yourself.</div>

Decision making is inherently an emotional process. As we know from neuroscience these days. The default instant gratification circuit in the brain can hijack the wiser decision pathways.

To paraphrase, they said there are no wrong decisions. There are just the decisions you make. And after that, you have whatever new information to make the next decision, and so on. But instead of being frozen and not sure what to choose, just make a choice and then adjust. 

I think of it often.</div>

Act swiftly, accept the consequences, and plan the next move accordingly. Like you said, it's not about always making the "right" decision, it's about being able to move forward and not be paralyzed with indecision while problems grow.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That's an interesting way to put it—no wrong decisions made, just decisions. A wise person once told me that if I am struggling between two decisions, neither is a bad decision. Otherwise, it would be a clear choice. So both are good! This perspective can give so much freedom from regret!

I think u/Quantumedphys makes a good distinction, which really boils down to just looking at the bigger picture. It is so simple, but we (I) can sometimes forget that when there appears to be difficulty in making a decision. 

I like the combination of both of these ideas. I choose both!</div>
