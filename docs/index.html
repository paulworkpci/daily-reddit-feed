Torso and Abdomen
	•	Organomegaly: Internal organs, such as the heart, liver, and kidneys, may enlarge due to prolonged exposure to HGH.
	•	HGH Belly (Distended Abdomen): A common effect of long-term HGH misuse is visceral organ growth and thickened abdominal muscles, leading to a protruding abdomen despite having low body fat.
	•	Increased Muscle Mass: Excess HGH can lead to disproportionate muscle growth, altering body symmetry.</div>

If Gemini were as popular as ChatGPT, or least close I think it would be easier for Google to justify $80 billion. But they just haven’t been able to gain that much market share despite having better price to performance for a while now. First mover advantage seems insurmountable.</div>

The only positive news we’ve really heard about them is their massive cluster, but you don’t hear much about grok at all.

But that's pretty much it, hopefully Grok 3 is an actual contender for best model, although i doubt it</div>

By the time we get Grok 2 open sourced there will be much more capable and more efficient open source models, you could argue quen is already better and much smaller</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/Dvori92:

Alleged Manifesto of Cybertruck bomber states the "mystery drones" are Chinese show of force!   
  
*"What we have been seeing with 'drones' is the operational use of gravitic propolsion systems powered by aircraft by most recently China in the East Coast.*  
  
*They are the most dangerous threat to national security that has ever existed.  They basically have an unlimited payload capacity and can park it over the White House. It's checkmate."*   
  
According to the Shawn Ryan Show.

                        <div class="comment-body">While I'll admit, I never gave this piece of information a lot of weight (*if any*), after this new development with the email, and having had the likes of David Grusch stating that there is a cold war around crash-retrieved and reverse-engineered tech where a US adversary supposedly made some major breakthroughs in recent years...

Well, I guess this supposed leak from 4chan about "[China having cracked NHI tech and achieving antigravity](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1gk2vyy/is_there_anything_to_this_4chan_post_about_china/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)" is worth a second read?

Add to that that [there are precedents](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1aboz4e/amy_eskridge_nasa_antigravity_propulsion_research/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) for suspicious deaths/suicides tied to people involved in antigravity research...

While we are a long way from just taking this email as undeniable truth ([although apparently the FBI says it was sent by Livelsberger](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1hsy9fx/east_coast_drones_fbi_says_they_have_strong/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button))... it does bring up interesting pings worth looking into, I'd say.

Was he both a remote and autonomous systems manager or did you misspell and mean he was a remote autonomous systems manager? Autonomous systems can mean a lot of things but it sounds like you are inferring that he was working with drones or am I misunderstanding you?

If anything, TikTok will just be replaced by a clone or it will be replaced by existing platforms implementing the same engagement-hogging strategies.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly this. A lot of “brain rot” content exists elsewhere, and of course addiction to these apps is very real. However, a lot of important information - voices being oppressed and censored in real time - is shared on the platform. TikTok is an actual threat to those who wish to control “free” speech. To throw the baby out with the bath water on this is to silence independent thought, while making those in power more powerful.  </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Timeline of Notable Events at Fort Bragg/Fort Liberty:

1993-1997:
Ten infant deaths occurred on the base under unexplained circumstances, leading to investigations into potential environmental hazards [1].

1995:
Two soldiers from Fort Bragg, James Burmeister and Malcolm Wright, committed racially motivated murders in Fayetteville, NC. They were linked to white supremacist ideologies [2].

2002:
A string of domestic violence cases resulted in several Fort Bragg soldiers murdering their spouses within weeks of returning from deployment. These were attributed to PTSD and combat stress [3].

2020-2021:
	•	Over 80 soldiers stationed at Fort Bragg died from sudden or unexplained causes, with 33 deaths listed as “undetermined” [4].
	•	A significant rise in drug overdoses among soldiers was reported during this time [5].

2023:
Over a dozen special operations soldiers were detained in a drug trafficking investigation, highlighting ongoing substance abuse issues [6].

June 2023:
Fort Bragg was renamed Fort Liberty as part of a broader initiative to remove Confederate names from military installations [7].

October 2024:
Former President Donald Trump pledged to restore the original name, sparking renewed debate over the base’s historical legacy [8].

January 1, 2025:
Two major attacks occurred:
	1.	Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar, a veteran associated with Fort Bragg, drove a truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing 14 people. The FBI classified this as a lone-wolf ISIS-inspired terrorist act [9].
	2.	Matthew Alan Livelsberger, an active-duty soldier at Fort Bragg, detonated a Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, killing himself and injuring seven others. The incident is under investigation as a potential terrorist act [9].

Key Patterns and Issues:
	•	High number of unexplained deaths and overdoses [4][5].
	•	Recurring criminal activities, including drug trafficking and violent crimes, by personnel [2][6].
	•	Psychological stress linked to PTSD and deployment cycles [3].
	•	Controversies surrounding its name and Confederate legacy [7][8].
	•	Recent violent acts tied to individuals connected to the base [9].

Fort Bragg/Fort Liberty has a long and troubling history of incidents that highlight systemic issues within its ranks and raise broader questions about oversight, mental health support, and institutional culture.

Summary of MKUltra:
	•	What It Was: MKUltra was a covert program run by the CIA starting in 1953 to explore mind control techniques. It involved experiments on unwitting participants, including the use of drugs (like LSD), hypnosis, sensory deprivation, and psychological manipulation [10].
	•	When It Started: Officially began in 1953 [10].
	•	Why It Ended: The program ended due to exposure and public outcry after investigative reporting and Senate hearings in the 1970s revealed its unethical nature [10].
	•	When It Ended: It was officially terminated in 1973 [10].
	•	Known Connections to Fort Bragg: No direct connections have been documented between MKUltra and Fort Bragg/Fort Liberty. However, given Fort Bragg’s role as a major military hub, it is plausible that personnel trained there could have been indirectly involved in related programs, though evidence is lacking.

Ghosts in the Machine, a US Army PSYOPs recruitment video even glorifies his work along with a silhouette of him to show his evil is still active.

                        <div class="comment-body">People generally do not need as much information as they think they do. Knowledge that cannot be applied in real life holds little value. Moreover, integrating knowledge into life is a gradual process, it cannot happen instantly, which is why one should focus on the basics and what interests him first, rather than diving into complex topics or intellectual debates.

Simply knowing intricate concepts does not contribute much to personal growth, though many believe otherwise and engage in futile competitions over who knows more, even though it hardly matters. As you pointed out, social media worsens this problem, acting both as a source of addiction on one end and a so called “platform for knowledge” on the other.

Social media has perfected “paralysis by analysis” and has become a significant drain on energy for many. Honestly, most people would be far better off reading old encyclopedias than wasting time on social media, including the very people on this subreddit.</div>

It took me a long time to figure out that for me, having more information did not make me do more things…it just made me second guess myself because there was always some piece of contradictory information out there.

The place to start is to…..start. And do. And be of action.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">As someone who develops screen time management tools, I really relate to this. These platforms like Reddit absolutely can be gold mines of information when used intentionally - whether it’s catching up on news, solving technical problems, or finding niche communities. The key is having systems in place to manage usage.

One effective approach I’ve found is timeboxing - setting specific time windows for social media use combined with app blockers. This way you can still benefit from the valuable content while avoiding those endless scrolling sessions and “parasocial rabbit holes” you mentioned. It’s not about complete abstinence, but rather creating boundaries that help maintain focus and discipline.

The platforms themselves aren’t inherently bad - it’s the unconscious, unlimited consumption that causes issues. With the right controls in place, they can be genuinely useful tools rather than attention traps.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</div>

Having said that, prior to 2024, I constantly changed what activities and categories I tracked, which screwed around with me trying to see a meaningful 'year'.

Last year was the first full year I had a stable set of categories (what you see above). Lesson learned was 'less is more', and I ended up spending way less time agonising over or amending allocations.</div>

I agree, there is a lot to be said about the image being built around productivity, but the boring and underwhelming reality is that the secret sauce is no sauce. I like the phrase "deep respect for your current state" and I agree with it, effectiveness is rooted in humility and the appreciation of the variables at play, if you steal from yourself today, tomorrow will come to settle the debt.</div>

Yes I find there's sometimes almost a 'fad diet' aspect to it, where people dismiss their current selves with all its nuances, then enter a vicious cycle of seeking an external solution 'promise', and then getting frustrated when it doesn't mesh for them.

And I definitely agree with your "steal today, debt tomorrow", it's definitely something I still struggle with today, on a daily basis as well as longer term, and to be honest one of the reasons I'm tracking my time like this!</div>

It's not their "advanced drones" being deployed, but "older" tech used, as he said, as a show of force.

Like a, "hey, look what we can do" kind of thing. It'd be even more "insulting" if it's not their "advanced" tech being used.

Again, I don't personally buy the manifesto. I think you're right that it's a ff.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/PositiveSong2293:

---

"On December 31, Sam Shoemate, an intelligence officer and Chief Warrant Officer 2 (retired from the U.S. Army), received an email allegedly sent by Matthew Livelsberger, who would later be identified as the author of the detonation of a Tesla Cybertruck at Trump Tower the following day. In this disturbing document, Livelsberger boldly states: "What I am about to send will change the course of humanity."


In the email manifesto, Matthew Livelsberger makes a series of statements covering various topics related to national security and military operations.


But the most striking part of the email comes when the whistleblower addresses the issue of drones in the U.S.


Livelsberger claims that China is responsible for the recent wave of drones over U.S. soil, detailing the use of gravitational propulsion systems in aircraft. He emphasizes that, according to his information, Chinese operations have been escalating, with drones being launched from submarines in the Atlantic. Equipped with high stealth capabilities and unlimited payload capacity, these drones pose a significant threat, being able to operate in an almost undetectable manner."

China is taking the risk of flying their top of the line next generation propulsion system on US soil for everyone to see just for the lols? No fear of the US being able to bring these down and study the tech?

They make them to relate to specific demographics so they can manipulate their opinions. "As a queer black gay man I will vote for Trump!! You should too, fellow gay queer black men!"

They put a LOT of effort into these troll accounts. Some getting very popular and post top tier funny stuff for the sake of gaining trust. Im not sure a actual AI bot could successfully grow an op account but maybe.

If the account doesn't gain traction they make them behave in terrible and antisocial ways so they can use the screenshots to farm anti-lgbt/racist (pick your demographic) circlejerks.. or just use them to mob people.

They tried a ton of crazy stuff with fake influencers. All for the purpose of swaying public opinion. And nothing gets done about it! There are already millions of these all working for thousands of different causes.</div>

But in very simple terms, you are close- they are controlled by two spinning permanent magnets.

                                <div class="reply-body">The bigger question is how could you possibly explain what store you’re likely to go to your dog who has zero idea how the human economy or society functions, much less any way to communicate those concepts to your dog.

Sure, you could severely dumb it down with with pictures so they may associate a picture of dogfood with a picture of Petco and milk with a grocery store. Then, you could show your dog your shopping list and he could point to the right store. But your dog would have no concept about of all the reasoning humans go through to select the right store. They just can’t even begin to comprehend it - much less the far greater human ecosystem and capitalism and $$.

OP’s point is that this will be the same with humans and ASI. Initially, the ASI’s explanations will make sense - more-or-less. But as the ASI advances, humans will quickly realize they have no fucking clue as to how ASIs make decisions. At all. 

While I’m sure the ASI’s can provide reasonable “sounding” explanations, they won’t come close to describing the true complexities that go into their decisions anymore than we can explain why we need a job to earn $$ so we can buy dog food at Petco for our dog. All our dog knows is: “me hungry, go Petco”. And that’s how we’ll sound to the ASI.</div>

As if spending so much time studying AI and Comp Sci wasn't enough, he went and got another PhD in neuroscience and published a bunch of groundbreaking work in that field as well. It reads like the background of some genius comic book hero.

His greatest weakness is that he's not as concerned with making products as he is with the research. That certainly came back to bite Google, but now that DeepMind is paying attention, I think we're going to see some very exciting things in the coming years.</div>

So if you are like me, my number one tip to you is this… Do not say to others what you will do, just keep it a secret to yourself, and do it anyway.

The reason for this strategy is to make you mentally strong and internally motivated so you will not struggle to find motivation and do the things you said you would...</div>

My buddy saw me looking and said 'you got no chance with her dude'.  So, since I'm insane', I walked up to her and said 'do you have the time?' (this was pre cell phone days).  So she looked at her watch and said '9:30'.  I said 'thanks.  My buddies said you wouldn't give me the time of day' and walked off.  An hour or so later she comes up to my booth, hangs out, and we wound up dating until she moved out of state.  Nice woman.  I wish her well.</div>

His parents wouldn’t let us go up to his bedroom to “hang out,” so he said we were going for a walk instead. Burn off some energy.

It was winter and it was good. 

The smirk on his face, as we walked back inside, is burned in my brain for eternity.

At the end of the day, the goal is to increase engagement on their platform. The secondary advantage of AI-generated users is that they're locked into Meta's platform; you can't find the same user on TikTok.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Just want to clarify, because I haven't been able to find anything yet - is this real, or did someone just make like, parody accounts off the back of Meta's recent announcement to get people upset? The dates in the image don't make sense, first of all, and second of all just the content does not pass the smell test. It seems entirely like the kind of thing someone would make and share on the internet to get people outraged. 

As a sub we are generally very aware of the fact that we should not trust everything we see, but I think we are still very susceptible - especially to things that "we" "_want_" to be true.</div>
