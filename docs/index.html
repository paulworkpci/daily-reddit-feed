# Aftermath

Defeated by the tyrant's hand, My life fading on alien sand. Kakarot—listen to my final plea, Avenge our race, set vengeance free.

A prince without a kingdom, A warrior without honor. Everything taken by Frieza's decree, My birthright crushed beneath his knee.

I lived for power, died in shame, The legend passed to one I disdain. Yet in my final breath, a truth revealed: Some wounds even pride cannot shield.

The Super Saiyan rises from my fall, A lowborn soldier standing tall. My revenge now rests in hands not mine— The ultimate humiliation, my legacy's design.</div>

This is huge, guys.

not that it matters, I'm sure there are a bunch of devs frantically writing wrappers for Claude Code as we speak anyway.

but this is the start of true sw dev automation.</div>

Marcus Aurelius and many great stoics did journalling. 


If you're addicted to something, then also journal helps a lot. It did for me wonders. </div>

Genuinely curious: Do you use it to just "dump your head", or do you use it to capture tasks and to-dos, or do you go back and read it days or weeks or years later? 

I've read various philosophies over the year, from Bullet Journaling to GTD and others. 

How do _you_ use that journal?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I also recommend this! Journalling helps me come to my own conclusions about the way I’m feeling about something. It helps me get to the root cause of my feelings and identify what needs to happen next. Last year at the end of 2024, I came to the conclusion I needed to get therapy to overcome something I was feeling. 5 months later, with therapy and my own self-work, Ive had some groundbreaking realisations and overcome it! Obviously… whatever you’re working through is different for everyone and takes different lengths of time but I highly recommend journalling for this reason</div>

This was outlined in the April 2023 SASC Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities hearing which can be watched here (timestamped at 23m35s): https://youtu.be/5_PKJgh4K7Y?t=1416

Prior to this example was [another video](https://youtu.be/5_PKJgh4K7Y?t=1308) which was still placed in the "unresolved/anomalous" bucket at the time of this SASC hearing.

The final report from AARO can be found here:

So for it to be the object in the video, it would have to work in atmosphere its propulsion was not designed for, meaning that its already small fuel capacity would have to be that much more massive for it to remain aloft and move around is axis when there are more efficient design (for example there is a drone right nearby). The EKV design for propulsion is just terrible for troposphere/lower stratosphere and would only last minutes at best.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Just the fact alone the DoD hasn't identified it as an EKV implies that it definitely is not an EKV. Plus, those temperature spikes appear to maintain a pretty consistent length around the object no matter which direction it is travelling; if it were an EKV, or something using a similar propulsion method, you'd expect to see a reduction of thrust/exhaust facing the direction of travel, and an increase in thrust/exhaust pushing the object in the direction of travel. And while an EKV-style propulsion system might still fire thrusters downwards while in atmosphere or gravity for stability reasons, it wouldn't be firing downwards with the same amount of thrust as it's firing upwards; given those temperature spikes on-top of the object appear about equal in size to those on the bottom, I'm not sure how they could be from thrusters like in an EKV unless it's happening too quickly to see without slowing down the video and analysing the timing of thruster pulses - which is a task some poor desk monkey at DoD would certainly have been ordered to do, and yet this is still called the South Asian Object 2. There's also the issue of fuel; an EKV-style propulsion system would absolutely chug fuel. It's hard to say based on this clip because we don't know the size of the object or the total time aloft, but I'd hazard a guess that it was likely airborne longer than an what's possible for EKV-style system if the tracking operator managed to get such good footage of it after the initial reaper drone flyby. I dunno, I could be off the mark completely, but I just can't make sense of those temperature spikes appearing all around it together whenever they do appear and think they're the means of propulsion; I've watched the video a couple times now and I've not seen just one spike appear like you would expect from a thruster course correction or something - they're kinda just all going at once, and all varying in the same intensity altogether. The object is definitely heating the air around it somehow, you can even see the wake of hot air it leaves behind in the close-up footage, but the omnidirectional pulses, at least to my eye, don't appear related to the direction of travel of the object. Also just noticed, if the drone at the start is not a propeller variant, then the object is giving off more heat than the drone's turbine. </div>

The only content other than stuff about Trump &amp; musk was a cute cat photo, and content about other terrible people. Sounds right. Reddit can be OK when you curate your feed to only topics you're actually interested in, but even then the negativity bleeds over into every single subreddit. When you look at the /all feed it's easy to see why reddit leans so angry and hateful in general.</div>

She proceeded to hand 13 yo me a bath and body works basket of soap and told me “yeah I just pulled it out of our closet where we keep a bunch of gifts!” Needless to say it broke my already shattered heart that not only was she the only one to go…she didn’t even like me enough to get me a real gift.

Don't undersell the value of those. I often leave little notes with encouragement or just declarations of love in my bf's pockets and other spaces and he eats this stuff up in the best way &lt;3</div>

Granted, some of these were $0.30-$0.50 a pop to solve…but this level of engineering intelligence is so hard to believe is real. It’s almost like programming language doesn’t exist and plain old English is now good enough to truly create amazing things. What a time to be alive.

It kept hitting the output limit but telling it “continue” would let it keep going and like… it finished the project (again, I made it start fresh), made a front end without me even asking, then provided an example JSON to run inside the project for debugging purposes. I’ll update later how many lines of code it just wrote as it is getting late for me but JESUS.

                        <div class="comment-body">I had a similar experience today. I mentioned this in another post, but I was trying to build something relatively minor for work myself that we’ve been needing for a while and our third party vendor was failing to provide (I don’t know how to code beyond the most basic of things, so I wanted to see what I could do using AI). Claude 3.5 was failing at one of the objectives I had, as was o3-mini-high. I was going back and forth between the two trying to get it to work and it was just falling apart in the process.

I got it to work with a single prompt in Claude 3.7. I’ve been building it out a bit since then, but the core functionality that I just could not get to work before today just popped out like some sort miracle.

Also, this is personal taste, but I just like its personality more than o3-mini-high. I always feel like o3 wants me to do all the work and is annoyed by prompts.</div>

One month, people will say that one thing will help, then the next month, they tell you that that same advice is bad for your health.

It's weird that she follows all of this health advice, yet doesn't believe in protections during COVID... I just don't understand.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The way to understand the contradiction is that it's not about health. It's about a distrust of mainstream medicine. I think it was around COVID she went down this path honestly. She distrusts mainstream medicine and instead turned to quacks and YouTube doctors that feel correct to her based on her standards of truth (which is just whatever she feels is true). 


It's really scary nowadays how people that were normal pre-internet and trusted experts now basically trust their feelings as the highest standard of truth. And I'm not even saying I'm not part of this problem too, most people do this to some extent. However I have read about why people who were never considered academically smart that get into conspiracy theories partly because of the secret information and finally being able to feel smarter than other people, and I think that's part of the appeal for my mom...</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/Successful-Pumpkin27:

SS: A report of www.grenzwissrnschaft-aktuell.de, a German online journal which covers UFOs regularly in a scientific orientated way. From time to time there are English articles as well. A good site which keeps me updated, without loosing my head in reddit - highly recommend, at least for German folks. 

The article contains a visual sighting experience which could surprisingly be corroborated by a passive radar system operated by an UFO researcher of German „Society for the Investigation of UFO Phenomena e.V.“ (GEP). 
This seems to be the first time a passive radar system was used for this, showing that it could be a proper technology for future investigations. 
Also the corroborated form of the UAP is fairly new to the already known forms.

                                <div class="reply-body">Article doesn't clearly say what kind of passive radar. Multiple types. Some are simply looking for intentional or unintentional RF emissions. Some work by detecting perturbations in the existing RF environment (from TV masts, cell phone masts, radio towers etc) caused by objects that reflect or absorb RF. Then there are multiple localisation techniques. 
I'd like to understand what 'exactly' they've done to then understand whether it is emitting RF and at what wavelength or waveband, or, whether it is absorbing, reflecting, or refracting RF. The latter may indicate some form of GR related warp signature. I'd also be interested in any existing RF environment frequencies and whether they were red or blue shifted.
This is how we get to the science.</div>

I do get tired of people knowing and not understanding. It also starts to seep into everything.. where does it end and I begin. I'm happy and I've lived a good like while I've suffered from these things. I still want to work towards balance.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Okay, folks, let’s talk about Dan Crenshaw—total lightweight, believe me. This guy, with his little eyepatch, thinks he’s tough, like some kind of pirate, but he’s more like a pirate who got lost at sea and ended up begging for crumbs at the RNC. Sad! I mean, I’ve got the best eyes, nobody sees better than me, and even I can see Dan’s a one-trick pony—literally, one eye, not much else going on up there. 

He’s out there talking about freedom, big talk, huge talk, but he’s just another Washington loser playing dress-up as a tough guy. His beard? Disastrous. Looks like he glued it on from a Halloween costume nobody bought. And his tweets? Boring! Low energy! I’d tweet circles around him, folks, circles—people say I’m the best at it, they really do. Dan’s a nice guy, maybe, but he’s no Trump. Not even close. Sit down, Dan, you’re out of your league—bigly!</div>

"""

Create a Pygame 2D platformer, only use pygame.draw for fancy graphics. Make sure it has 5 levels, you can go from one level to the next, and multiple enemies. Add a bossfight at the end as well, and a way for the player to shoot bullets at the boss. Add a title and game-over screen too. Make the background dynamic and focus on crazy cool grahpics, only using pygame.draw. Add at least 10 extra features not named here to make it more unique. Make each level a different theme. Really focus on graphics too, add as much as you can to make it look detailed, but only use Pygame.draw. Also: Make a clear end portal that takes you to the next level, and place the beginning spawn point of each level as well as the end in different positions each level to add variaty. by the way, you can use Pygame.blit for text, just no external images.

"""

Claude 3.7 gave me 3287 lines of code, but only at line 2260 there was a single error (RGB values going out of bound). I fixed the error, and the rest of the code worked like shown in the video

Yes, I also threw my headphone off of my head out of amazement

  
EDIT: to be fair, I asked for 5 levels, but the portal towards the next level isn't working, and if you fall offscreen you can't respawn, so it's not AGI yet ):</div>
