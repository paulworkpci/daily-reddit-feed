It's easy to spot because it uses the familiar "school essay" style of paragraphs where you "tell ''em your gonna tell 'em, then tell 'em, then tell them you told them".

--------

I think this is a really interesting observation and worth unpacking. While I agree that some comments and posts do come across as "AI-like," there are a few reasons this might happen that don’t necessarily involve actual AI or bots.

ESL Practice: You mentioned English as a second language, and I think that could play a part. Many ESL learners are taught a rigid writing structure in school that emphasizes clarity and organization. The "tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em" format is a common pedagogical tool for teaching essay writing, so it’s not surprising that it might show up in informal settings like Reddit.

Karma Farming: Karma farmers are another likely factor. Some people craft bland, overly polite, or generic comments to farm upvotes because it’s safe and avoids controversy. This can come across as robotic or formulaic, but it’s really just a strategy to gain Reddit karma for other purposes (e.g., selling accounts or using them for other subreddits).

Cultural Shift: It’s worth considering that the prevalence of AI-like writing might reflect a cultural shift toward concise, structured, and "algorithmic" communication. Social media, SEO, and professional communication trends often reward clear, formulaic writing that aligns with this style, so people may unintentionally mimic it.

AI Influence: Exposure to AI tools like ChatGPT might also have an indirect effect. People interact with AI-generated text and, whether they realize it or not, they may adopt some of its patterns when they write.

Low-Effort Posting: Sometimes people just throw together generic responses without much thought. The lack of originality and depth in their comments can make them sound like they’re following a formula, even if there’s no AI involved.

Ultimately, while it’s frustrating to encounter shallow or repetitive comments, I think it’s a stretch to assume these are bots or even people intentionally trying to sound like AI. Instead, it’s likely a mix of the factors above. It’s good to stay vigilant, though—if someone really does seem suspicious, reporting them is always an option.</div>

How does the "instant exchange of information" not "affect ping at all"? I mean, initially if you're only using the tech to transfer *certain* data, sure, but I suspect as with any communications tech the bandwidth will continually increase, meaning we could eventually transfer all data via quantum teleportation?

note that I don't know anything about the field, I'm genuinely asking these questions.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Good luck guys. Not that AI is not the future of humanity, but they're currently burning hundreds of billions of dollars and have nothing even remotely close to profit on the horizon. And this is not like Uber, where they'll raise prices from $10 to $20 once they're established and then start making money, they currently need to raise prices from $0 to $50+ on most users to come even close to recovering their expenses, and obviously that's not even close to happening. Arguably their strongest path to profit right now is through their API and third parties using GPT integrations, but the truth is is that those platforms are struggling to recover their costs to OpenAI, because customers aren't willing to pay. You've got troves of apps out there doing great stuff with the API but needing to charge customers $15+ a month to use it, and thus struggling to gain any traction.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don’t think this is necessarily a bad thing. For example, I often write comments on Reddit and then ask ChatGPT to improve them in terms of grammar, punctuation, formatting, etc. I also use search to gather data I need. After proofreading the response, I end up with comments that are often better than my original ones, complete with sources and data to back up my points.

In a way, it feels like reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). By improving my own writing and data, posting it to Reddit, and having it potentially scraped for training, the model could become even more capable over time.

That said, I can also see the other side of things. Bad actors or trolls could misuse LLMs to flood the internet with misinformation or harmful content, which would negatively affect the quality of data these models learn from.</div>

Just because your boss doesn't want you to use AI doesn't mean its not going anywhere. Corporate jobs can really be a trap if you don't put in the effort outside of work to keep up.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I love how probably nobody is seeing how insane that it is equally horrifying either way for either outcome.  You gotta work to work now, or maybe, you don't need to work to work, but you have to work.

If this doesn't tell everyone, you need to work for yourself in this landscape I don't know what will, but not everyone can work for themselves, what are people going to do ? create enclaves, produce products in groups of 3 - 4 highly skillset workers? with a factory of 3D printers, a weird enmeshment of content creator, mixed with softer engineers and a few textile experts?

Because its going that way, but as of now thats the extreme, but honestly, working to just work is broaching on insanity especially if the yield isn't insanely high.  Sure, plenty will do it to remain competitive, but everyone? when do we wake up.

Some of us can endlessly run on treadmills and be underhanded and competitive (cluster b types, and so on) but there are many who will just want to live a peaceful life, and do a reasonable amount, a required amount).  I feel like we're letting the gears go into overdrive and we're not saying "but most of us are just human."

Very dangerous I feel.  Like to what end, do we draw a line? place a humans value in society.  Everyones got to be at the top of their game at all times.  It just doesn't compute.  Unless your not human in the mind.  So now we forgo our humanity? do those just split off lol its crazy to envision.</div>

Most people aren’t able to stockpile money. When nobody has money, nobody can eat. When nobody can eat, everything falls down. When everything falls down, money is useless.</div>

GLP-1 agonists are essentially curing obesity globally, but only those incapable of critical thinking would call Novo Nordisk evil for trying to recoup their investment and make enough money to invest in even more medicines. There are hundreds of more examples like this including many that directly enable the comfortable life *you* live today.

Few enough entities invent new things as-is -- I think it's ridiculous to start demonizing those of them inventing new technologies with the hopes to make money. We'd be stuck in the Middle Ages with that mentality, dying in the streets from dysentery at the age of 5, because god forbid we incentivize improvements!</div>

After all the excitement of disclosure and all these recent sightings, I am noticing a growing sentiment that paints the “aliens” as some kind of saviors of humanity. 

Anyone else unnerved by this?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I just heard the CEO of Farsight talking about his encounters with “aliens” and how they refuse to take any direct action with humanity but will guide the way and also how they are “free will fanatics”. This reminded me of the thing that goes around with the Illuminati where they must act right in front of our faces as a workaround to free will in a sense. 

Especially the free will part, like “hey us aliens are not going to force you to do anything but you should trust all of our advice and follow our exact steps” 

Sketchy.

Decades later, I still remember feeling like I existed in two places at once.

                                <div class="reply-body">Speaking from personal experience: They are gateways to the spirit realm; however, it opens you up to all spirits, good and bad. Psychedelics force your way into the spirit realm, opposed to being invited. Same with astral projection and other practices/substances that involve the spirit realm. Forcing your way - without an invitation from the Lord - opens you up to demonic oppression/possession. If you visit the spirit realm, I’d recommend pursuing the Lord so He can show you what He wants to show you through an invitation…opposed to forcing yourself in. Satan will allow you to have an enjoyable experience so you keep coming back; however, it’s rooted in deception to distract you from Jesus and your God-given destiny.

It may look silly here since the animations aren't perfected, but can you imagine *real-life* graphics for war games, etc? Like forget DLSS RTX Ray tracing and all that bull shit. The future is indistinguishable mirror images of reality for gaming. And it's here, happening now. Completely different visual architectures for making it happen *in real time*.

How insane is that?</div>

I had a very unbalanced lifestyle at first. I started doing sadhguru's 30 minute yoga practice taught in the inner engineering program. I was 100% committed to doing this yoga practice daily. It was definitely hard at first but soon it became second nature for me to do my practice daily.

I can sort of tell by the fact there's a telltale green flashing light that comes in around the 19 second mark. Looks like it's making a turn and the fog it's moving through is creating an illusion of varying velocity but it looks like it's a plane making a turn.</div>

                <div class="post-content">All day i've been feeling anxiey, however, i'm delaying my tasks until i can delay nomore.

the more i delay , the more anxious i feel. sometimes i feel a bout of energy surge and i accomplish something, but most of the time i'm just delaying the uncomfortable emotions and fear of failure.

i don't think i'm lazy, i'm passive aggressively suffering. it's like being slow burned to death.

i'm feeling so stressful now, i fear a headache is looming soon.

however, i can't seem to get out of the loo...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">i completely get where you're coming from. procrastination feels like this vicious cycle. you're anxious, so you put things off, and putting them off makes the anxiety even worse. it’s not laziness; it’s more like a mental gridlock where everything feels too overwhelming to start. i procrastinate a lot too, and it’s usually because i feel this pressure to do things perfectly or the fear that even if i try, it won’t be good enough.

sometimes what helps me is breaking tasks into really small pieces, like telling myself, "i'll just open the document and sit with it for five minutes." it sounds ridiculous, but that small start can sometimes lead to real progress.

it’s okay to feel that stress. it’s your mind telling you it needs some kindness. maybe pick one tiny thing to do, even if it feels insignificant. even the smallest step is a win.</div>

I captured a brightly lit UAP in the SW sky, pulsing from orange to red. It slowly descended over \~15 min. Here’s the most compelling video, shot through my Meade StarNavigator 102mm telescope from my deck.  The object was also seen by a coworker.

This. Is. Good. Shit.

Looks like a lava lamp. Let's call them lava lamps.

To the top with you.

Edit: actually that European UAP study labeled the white ones Cosmics and the black ones Phantoms, so maybe for the reds we can go with Cinders. I may have simplified their definition a bit in saying black/white, which in actuality focuses on signature and reflectivity.

I was going to suggest Hellions, Scorchers, or Infernals, but I'm against attaching a negative label to a whole group of space people we know nothing about.

Edit: Here's an article on that study. The study itself is a PDF I'll see if I can find, it might be mentioned in the article. Technically by the study's definition, these red ones would also be considered cosmics, but it's more fun to differentiate the reds in my opinon. [https://thedebrief.org/cosmics-and-phantoms-ukrainian-independent-study-reveals-observations-of-unidentified-aerial-phenomena/](https://thedebrief.org/cosmics-and-phantoms-ukrainian-independent-study-reveals-observations-of-unidentified-aerial-phenomena/)

Edit: Here is a link to the study PDF: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.11215](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.11215)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">However, heating the food multiple times can also work better than one long session. As most microwave carousels will alternate the direction of spin every time you start them.

I wonder which method would work better for heating food. Baby sitting multiple heating processes (including time to manually mix up the food for even heating) or one long session at a lower temperature.

I suppose it depends on how much time a person is willing to invest versus the ease of using one session. Seems like "MythBusters" or "YouTube" territory.</div>

I don't know shit about D4 but from reading that article and the comment section it seems like he posted this video during a breif time when a seasonal elixir item was bugged and allowed players to get 1 million+ health and in turn use items which convert health into damage to essentially do unlimited damage and 1-shot pretty much everything. These 2 comments seems to sum it up.

&gt; With the bugged seasonal elixir, everyone was running sub 2 minute pit runs. The best of the best ran 90 second pits. Elon running 2 minutes was average at best

and

&gt; If it wasn't Spirit Born, I would believe that he put in the work... but that's just not the case. Spirit Born is extremely overpowered by design (a clearly well working marketing tool) in order to sell the recent expansion. Using rather basic gear it is possible to clear the higher difficulties. Further, this was posted yesterday, where there was a bug that allowed characters to see millions of hit points (instead of ~50k) with the "Antivenin" elixir. There are several options in Diablo 4 for tying damage to hit points using Overpower, and quite a lot of people used that exploit to get to places they wouldn't have otherwise been... like Musk. The bug is now patched.

So assuming that it was actually him and that he wasn't paying someone else to do it, the most likely explanation seems to be that he did the run during a brief period when there was a bugged item in the game which dramatically reduced the time it took *everyone* to do a level 150 pit run.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Here's a link to the original paper (open access): [An interpretable RNA foundation model for exploring functional RNA motifs in plants | Nature Machine Intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00946-z)

Here's a summary from ChatGPT comparing their model to ChatGPT and describing what the novel contribution is:

The RNA foundation model shares foundational AI principles with ChatGPT, such as leveraging large-scale pretraining to uncover complex patterns in sequential data, but it diverges significantly in purpose, design, and application. Unlike ChatGPT, which processes and generates natural language, the RNA model is domain-specific, analyzing RNA sequences to predict functional elements while emphasizing interpretability—a critical need in biological research. Its architecture is likely inspired by transformer models but optimized for the unique properties of RNA, such as nucleotide-specific patterns and biological context. The novel contribution of this work lies in bridging the gap between AI-powered prediction and scientific understanding by creating a transparent, interpretable model that not only identifies functional RNA elements but also provides actionable insights into their roles, advancing both computational biology and AI's applicability in the life sciences.</div>
