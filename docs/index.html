Right, the lizard brain is optimized for energy conservation and pain avoidance.

&gt; If you have two choices, and they’re relatively equal choices (it looks 50-50 to you) and you can’t decide, take the path that is more difficult and more painful in the short-term. 

&gt; Because what’s actually going on is: One of these paths requires short-term pain, and the other one maybe requires pain further out in the future. And what your brain is doing (through conflict avoidance) is it’s trying to push off the short-term pain.

&gt;  And by definition, if the two are even (50-50) and one has short-term pain, that means it has long-term gain. And by the law of compound interest, the long-term gain is where you want to go towards anyway.

&gt; So, your brain is overvaluing the side that has the short-term happiness, and it’s trying to avoid the one with short-term pain.

&gt; So, you have to cancel that tendency out (and it’s a powerful subconscious tendency) by leaning into the pain.

&gt; As most of you know, most of the gains in life come from suffering in the short-term, so you can get paid in the long-term. Working out (for me) is not fun. I suffer in the short-term. I feel that pain, but then in the long-term, I’m better off because I have muscles or I’m healthier. 

- Naval

Now if the choices aren't relatively equal, and you flip the coin and you are disappointed with either outcome, you have to search for a 3rd path.</div>

Did you think these two expected to end up on a giant kiss cam in front of thousands of spectators without warning? The shock, panic, internal guilt caused all rational thought to fly out the window. That's why they reacted the way they did. It's that simple.

It's like growing up in the 90s and coming home earlier than usual and catching your teen brother jerking it to women's lingerie section in the weekly catalogue. Is he going to reply calmly with "I'm just a developing adolescent who has a newfound appreciation for women's buttocks and breasts"? Of course not. He'd most likely panic and say some dumb shit like "I swear it isn't what it looks like, it's just for my science homework".</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Your bottom position looks pretty good to me, and you seem to descend with good knee position. This looks like some good squatting to me. 

One thing I notice (disclaimer, not a coach) is that at the top of every rep you seem to ensure your knees straighten out, but you don’t seem to finish straightening out your hips, which appears to leave you in a bit of a leant forward position at the start of the next rep. At lighter weights this may not be an issue, but may be an issue down the line. 

You may want to focus a bit on pushing your hips forward (maybe squeezing your butt) while finishing the ascent, ensuring your top position includes fully extended knees AND hips.</div>

Nothing really wrong with your squat except maybe that detail. The lean is minor right now, but as weights get heavier that will definitely tip you forward and make lifts much more difficult. Keep it up - slow and steady wins the strength race every time.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Keep your body engaged through the entire motion. Don’t relax, particularly in your hips &amp; core. This should helping your timing so your body goes up and down in one full motion rather than your upper body adjusting after you’ve reached full squat or full stand. 
Keep your eyes forward and head straight. Find a spot in front of you and give it a nice blank stare throughout the exercise. Your body has a tendency to go where your eyes are looking. In this case, when you looked down your upper half leaned forward.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree with this assessment. She is bouncing at the bottom of her squat because it’s not under full control you have to fight on the negative side of the lift just a little and dont be in a hurry to add weight. I like to make the rep harder on the drop by fighting it even more before I increase any weight. I believe in the Arthur Jones philosophy that the negative is the most important and productive part of lifting weights.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's not just AI. Ethnic Chinese are well represented in STEM research across pretty much all disciplines. As for why this is, probably a combination of culture and government policy. I can only speak anecdotally, but I once asked my dad, a professor of molecular biology, why he chose his field instead of something more lucrative like being a physician. He said that when he was in school in the 80s, going into basic research was considered more prestigious. A lot of his generation came to the US for work and of course imparted a cultural value on scholarship to their kids. It worked on me at least since I also have a PhD now, LOL.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;-High average IQ (~104-107)

&gt;-Whole lot of them, so statistically plenty of super-geniuses

&gt;-Culture emphasizing rigorous education from from toddlerhood to adulthood, meaning smart people tend to make the most of their brains

&gt;-Huge push for AI supremacy by Chinese government, so lots of investment

&gt;-Some of the brightest Chinese move to the US, meaning their kids (Chinese Americans) will almost certainly be well above average and have abundant access to educational resources.

I think this sums it up. Am I missing anything?</div>

The reason few farmers or Republicans recognize it as socialism is partially due to cognitive dissonance. But also, they view the subsidies as payment for their services (crops), and think of it through the lens of capitalism. They also view themselves as integral to the food security and national security of the country, even though big agriculture could and would put every small farmer out of business without these $80B/year farming wellfare subsidies.


Tldr: They see themselves as entrepreneurs doing business, and the subsidies are payment for their services. Is every government contractor a form of socialism?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">TLDW: He's saying Rogan should push back against BS and dubious claims as such a prominent voice. 

But he doesn't consider the fact that Rogan is intentionally and deliberately not pushing back. He says Rogan isn't evil like Stephen Miller, and I agree. But at the same time it's clear that Rogan DOES have an agenda and bias.

He's isn't a simple nudge from Luke away from calling balls and strikes and holding people accountable. Let's not forget, that he's deeply indoctrinated by right-wing Twitter.

Rogan is operating from the premise that Jan 6 was likely the Feds, that the 91 felonies are persecution, the 2020 election WAS rigged, Vaccines and lockdowns were fascism, the Dems are corrupt, and Trump isn't at fault for any of it, is not a criminal, is not corrupt, and he's the victim. 

Those are worldview shaping beliefs. 

So, for him to give Patel the benefit of the doubt yet strongly push back on Bernie is actually 100% expected. And in order to get Rogan to hold people accountable you have to somehow bring him back to Earth where it's obvious to him that he should push back on certain claims and people.</div>

&gt;Consider a 
2025×2025 grid of unit squares. Matilda wishes to place on the grid some rectangular tiles, possibly of different sizes, such that each side of every tile lies on a grid line and every unit square is covered by at most one tile.
Determine the minimum number of tiles Matilda needs to place so that each row and each column of the grid has exactly one unit square that is not covered by any tile.

None of the models tested on matharena.ai got a single point from it and I think neither the OpenAI and Google models completed it either.</div>

Deepmind’s AI did as well, but they didn’t announce it yet. And maybe they won’t, or will need to be more careful in what they say because Deepmind used a math-specific AI whereas ChatGPT is just a general AI that figured it out without additional math-related training?</div>

Sure: a lot of things along that line are actually much better outside the USA, but don't kid yourselves. 

The billionaires are VERY determined to change that across the entire planet, and they're winning.

If you walk into an emergency department, you'll wait for hours even if you're badly ill, and ambulances wait outside the hospital with patients in them because there are no spare emergency beds for them. If you want a routine operation, you could be on a waiting list for years. The system is broken.</div>

A war of the mind has been waged on people everywhere. It's not as organized and deliberate as some romanticize, but it is powerful and effective. It is generationally entrenched and new subjects are born every day not even knowing they're in a fight.


You know what I'm talking about. The News cycle, radicalized politics, hustle culture, success at the detriment of others, suffering is inherent to "earning a living"; the ethos hammered into us by people, companies, "foundations" and thinktanks who want nothing more than to protect what they got and take more.


Know your enemy. It isn't your neighbor you disagree with or laugh at for being dazzled by the propaganda machine. Those are our wounded and captured. Let them go or aid them, but never take your eye off the real entities who do not have your best interests in mind.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">His thing is being the skeptic. That’s literally his career. He isn’t an AI researcher. He isn’t an academic. He isn’t employed at a lab or university or research institute.

His career consists solely of tweeting, writing blogs, and doing speeches about how AI won’t progress. Of course he’s not just gonna say “welp I was wrong” because that means his career and income source is gone.

I really don’t know why we care though. He’s just a random person with 0 connection to the field who has never been employed or active in LLM research. 
 If you’re looking for a skeptic to listen to, at least let it be an AI researcher.</div>

At $8.97/pound that is almost $4.00 difference. Peppers I weighed were 0.73 pounds not the specified 1 pound. I would have paid $0.72 for missing product. These are just a couple examples. Weigh your purchases and if you find discrepancies speak with management.

How do I know it's not accidental?  Because it's *never* in "my" favor...it's always benefiting the store (ad says it's $1, rings up as $2 and you don't notice if you aren't actively watching).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don't think OpenAI can afford to release a model that's too underwhelming for GPT-5. 

Obviously it won't meet the ridiculously high expectations that people had of a GPT-3 to 4 jump, but OpenAI has been waiting for a significant jump in capabilities to release GPT-5 for so long(since at least the training and release of Orion, or GPT-4.5 which was intended to be GPT-5), that they've probably timed things pretty well for a significant release. 

Call me out if I'm wrong, but I predict a jump very close to the difference between GPT-4o, and the reasoning models(o1) with 80% or so certainty. If wrong, then things aren't looking great for OpenAI.</div>

And it thought only for a few minutes. This one now thinks for multiple hours, my guess is it could be something like tens of thousands of dollars per prompt. Completely unfeasible to release, they want to do additional research to manage to get compute costs manageable for release. We will probably have something of that power in maybe a year.</div>

See, potato salad is a mishmash of potatoes and condiments with bits of eggs and onions and celery. When you start spinning it, it's going to all go flying outwards in a centrifugal fashion, but it might not all be balanced, which means that the potato salad spinner is going to want to explode.

However, I think if it did safely reach 40-50k, it might heat up some from friction with the air. Probably not enough to produce plasma, though. Might be enough to hang out in the danger zone and spoil the mayo within the potato salad, tho.

                                <div class="reply-body">from this post I was getting the opposite impression. it's warning OP to stop. in my eyes, if it was reinforcing OP it would be egging OP to continue with his 50k rpm potato salad and calling him a genius. which it isn't.​

maybe it might encourage ppl to do dumb things socially. but when physical health is in danger, it always speaks up, in my experience ​​</div>

Now it tells me everything is basically a scam and dashes my hopes for everything.  Like I found a bag of jerky on the ground and asked ChatGPT if I could eat it and it said I'd die of botulism if I did despite it being sealed.  Apparently above 78 degrees it isn't shelf stable.  OG ChatGPT would have let me eat it.</div>
