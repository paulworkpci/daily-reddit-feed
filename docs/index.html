In the blog post, I argued that AI coding agents that offer subscriptions models create misaligned incentives. The reasons for the misaligned incentives are simple:

* AI coding agents, in its essence, are (useful!) wrappers around AI models. AI models charge per-token.
* The “subscription” includes an (often undisclosed) per-t...</div>

Going to unsub from this subreddit I think. It's just non-stop fucking spam for people who've whipped up junk wrappers for AI..

The big boys are going to win this fight because they own the models and they own the infrastructure that runs them.  They can loss leader their coding products to gain market share, training data, etc.

That's exactly what Anthropic is doing right now with Claude Code and anyone not taking advantage of that is likely wasting either their time or their money.</div>

I do think there are some people with principles in this world (so I don’t agree entirely), but if they’re already working at OpenAI there’s no reason they wouldn’t accept an offer like that.

And remember what happened when the OpenAI board tried to fire Sam over some ’concerns’? They couldn’t because MS immediately offered to buy him and anyone wanting to jump ship with him.

The lesson here is that the capitalist market powers are extremely powerful. Given the current system, people will deterministically act this way. There’s always someone willing to sell out for the right price. So changing the outcomes requires changing the system, not just appealing to individual virtue.</div>

I am a big believer in physiognomy.
"You are how you physically present."

And the guy looks like a fucking demon. Throw in some embedded nails and he could be a Hellraiser.

Ironic, isn't it, that those who appear in the world as the princes of peace and harmony are the very opposite of those things.

Ultimately, people like Copeland, I believe to be an organized mockery of the teachings of Christ.</div>

&gt;19 Lay **not** up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:


Prosperity gospel was **actively prohibited** in the Bible.


&gt;20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:


&gt;21 **For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.**


&gt;22 **The light of the body is the eye:** if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.


&gt;23 **But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!**


Describes Kenneth Copeland, even with his eyes.


&gt;24 ***No man* can serve two masters:** for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. **Ye *cannot* serve God and mammon [riches].**


&gt;25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Project Strawberry and Ilya leaving openAI increased speculation a lot, for a while. o1 was pretty revolutionary 7 months ago. So was o3, and they released its benchmarks almost as soon as they released o1.. DeepSeek being so competitive as an open model increased the speculation, too.

I think the release of 4.5 and 4.1, and the delay in DeepSeek R2, Anthropic having fairly tempered results with Claude 4.. has tempered expectations. Also labs being a bit open about training dates -&gt; release dates, and the race conditions reduce speculation on what is being held back.</div>

This is a way for payment processors to sneak unfavorable conversion rates on you (DCC) which can mark up your purchase 5-10% more that it should cost, and it's somehow legal in most of the world.

                                <div class="reply-body">Sorry if I wasn't clear enough - the ATM itself typically has two options for currency conversion.  A traveler can be overcharged by both the payment processor (the foreign ATM or the processor used by a local business) AND any credit card foreign transaction fees. Your bank or card issuer doesn't know what fee the ATM or restaurant or shop charges in their own fees and they don't reimburse you. However some cards do have zero or limited foreign transaction fees, which minimizes how much you're double gouged. 

Perhaps you have a card that reimburses for processor fees, but from looking for this for a long time I haven't discovered one.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That’s not really accurate. Saying only allowed to do that with Israel is just a lazy, sarcastic take that doesn’t hold up if you look at actual history. Israel linked espionage cases have led to arrests and serious consequences. Most famously, Jonathan Pollard, a US Navy analyst who spied for Israel, was arrested and spent 30 years in prison. It was one of the biggest intelligence scandals in US history. There's also the early 2000s AIPAC scandal where staffers were caught up in an espionage case. Charges were dropped eventually, but it was a huge deal at the time and got a lot of media and legal attention.</div>

This is my first post here . This is also my first effort to articulate a problem that has been bothering me for sometime . 

The problem is of envy , particularly envy/jealousy about other people's success . So when someone tells me about an achievement of theirs or even if I envision someone achieveing something in the future that I wanted but could not get , a thought which always comes to mind is that his/her success is not my success accompanied by a feeling of dejection/ jealousy/ unhappi...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I didn’t read the full post, but here’s what I’d say. 

Trust in the universe to take you, where you were meant to be. Whatever was meant for you will come, whatever wasn’t will flee. However, you can chase things not meant for you and put yourself in quite the dilemma. 


I used to be so sad and envious at my middle school football games. Watching all the little boys with loving fathers by their side cheering them on. “Why can’t I have that? Why won’t my dad love me”

Then a few years ago “how come he gets to have such a nice car? He’s my age, why don’t I get to enjoy the finer things?”

Then I realized, it’s quite a sad way of life. I am blessed in many of my own ways, and the more I realized it and became grateful for it, the more I realized the universe is on my side. It’ll help you, bless you, love you, all within signs and synchronicities. 

Now instead, I tear up with tears of joy when seeing things I had wished I had.

 “Look at that dad, loving his son and being there for him. Look how happy and content that kids heart is.” 

How wonderful :)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Hi Severe-Argument6689 , Thanks for taking the time to write this reply . I appreciate it 😊 . And while I do understand,  atleast in theory what you are trying to say , it's putting it in practice that's the difficult part . At present , I'm almost reflexive  . Like "Oh he has done/achieved this , so now I must do this to outshine him" , this is my thought process at present.  And I do realize at some level this thinking is unsustainable,  but I can't seem to overcome this.  It's like " Either I have to be better than this person or be perpetually unhappy that he/she is better than me " . So at present it seems it's either the anxiety of trying to be better or dejection that I'm not better . In Either case there's  no peace . 

So how do I get to where you are ? Is it a natural progression or is it something that you did ?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey mate! Congrats on the first post.

It sounds like you've got a decent amount of experience with meditation or at least the meditation world, so that helps a lot. I don't think you're alone in these struggles at all, I know I've experienced my own form of them, and still do now and again.

Are you familiar with metta and mudita?

If you're not familiar, metta(Loving-Kindness) meditation is the practice of cultivating love and kindness towards ourselves and others. In a way, this is us practicing our relationship with them in their absence. So that when we see them(or others in general) we remember that we care about them and wish for good things to happen to them.

Mudita(Sympathetic Joy) is a little less well known, but is especially good for working with envy and jealousy. The practice here involves wishing happiness on others and finding joy in the happiness they have. In other words, finding happiness in the happiness of others. Through this practice, when people around you succeed, you can find joy rather than jealousy.

In your case practicing Mudita on someone else's success, particularly a success that you're jealous of, might prove difficult. If you decide to explore Mudita, I'd suggest starting with small sources of happiness that you already find it easy to be happy about. Like when someone gets to enjoy the ice cream they've been craving, or they finally get to rest after a long day of work//school, etc. They're simple things, but even starting there helps to flex the mental muscles we need to appreciate the bigger and more difficult to appreciate things.

Anyways, that's the advice I have. If you're interested in learning more, Metta and Mudita are 2 of the 4 immeasurables. The immeasurables are great, life-giving places to rest our minds. And they each work to counter act different harmful habits. Loving Kindness works against Ill WIll, and Mudita works against Jealousy.

Good luck mate!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Hi Ucenna , Thanks for the advise 😊 . It .makes sense . The 2nd exercise that you mention , how should one go about it . And I'll be honest I have in past tried some Meditation.  But what I struggle with , in these mental practices is result.  Like how do I know if it's actually working or if I'm just engaging in self-delusio. Like what if in just engaging in these elaborate rationalization without any meaningful change.  For eg if I fast or I jog regularly, I'll lose weight and I'll be sure it's real and not self-delusion . But with Meditation I'm never sure.  So is there some way to tackle this . 
And being happy for others about something I don't want is easy and I do it often . The problem comes when the other person gets what I Have always wanted . That instantly feels like a competition and source of this unhappiness.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">In his book called "The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment", Thaddeus Golas proposes that we are all equal, made of one kind of whatever it is (nobody here but us chickens).

The book says something like it's best to always think of everyone as your equal.

They may not be equal in manifestation, but equal in potential.

I mean, this all sounds nice and dandy, but pretty hard to adhere to in real life.  
Jealousy is just part of the human experience, if you look at it long enough with equanimity and dispassion, its hold on you will lessen.

Acknowledge your jealousy, take an earnest look at it, let it play out, then you can move on.</div>

Health insurance is doing the same thing these days. Something isn't covered that should be? Sorry, AI determined... And we don't know why, but it's obviously correct. 

My company gave me 18 months' worth of Hertz rentals, and the fight to actually get the loyalty points for those rentals was goddamn *exhausting.* They give you a card full of numbers to call at the counter, but they all route to the same, entirely automated phone service that directs you to their website. 

Fuck Hertz.</div>

AI found that its way of doing things is generally the best way of doing things... xD

I had, in one of the 10 scripts, "AI failed me" as the author's name, and it referenced that, trying to interpret it; so credit where credit is due lol

That was when I wanted to make a quick script about something, within 15min tops, but giving AI the error messages when its code wouldn't work, because it would only somewhat function, would have it try to troubleshoot it; after that, the script wouldn't work at all anymore. The longer the chat went on, the worse it got.

Eventually it tried to convince me that it couldn't be done. The apps and modules it would have to call up would all be unable to pull it off. And kept arguing that my amendment couldn't work because powershell didn't have negative indexing, even after I swore it worked and proved it.  
So I just ended up doing it myself over the next few hours.  
Afterwards, I gave, in a fresh Chat, the LLM the code that previously the AI had come up with and tried to make work, and it rewrote it – it worked first try without issues... Well...</div>
