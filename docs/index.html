                        <div class="comment-body">Our company uses one of the big 4 accounting firms for year end accounts. My boss had several tax questions to ask them this year as we were restructuring some things. She asked me to ask the same questions to chatgpt while she sent the emails also to the accountant.


Chatgpt took about 20mins to get the full answer after some back and forth. 


The accountants took 2 weeks over several emails, and charged 3k for the advice. 


On top of that, chatgpt pointed out something that the accountants missed, which my boss asked them about and the agreed


Chatgpt was - better, cheaper (free) and alot quicker.


Alot of the criticism of LLMs seem to assume that professional human beings are perfect but they also make mistakes 


It's like when people point to waymo accidents and lose their minds... despite waymo still being safer than human taxi drivers</div>

But I agree that with that tech and the ability to challenge it properly, accounting firms do not have any valid excuses to charge so much and take that long.</div>

"New data" is not clear. Period

For anyone not intensely investigating, the new data they're constantly exposed to is either biased, dramatic, contradictory, or all 3 at once

People that aren't committed to engaging with complexity (&amp; why should they if it's not putting food on their table), are basically forced to settle on a simple position. The problem **is** the new data, or rather how it's presented to laymen</div>

 More eloquently explained in this piece.

&gt;The general reaction to language models among knowledge workers is one of denial. They grasp at the ever diminishing number of places where such models still struggle, rather than noticing the ever-growing range of tasks where they have reached or passed human level. Many will point out that AI systems are not yet writing award-winning books, let alone patenting inventions. But most of us also don’t do these things.

&gt;The economically and politically relevant comparison on most tasks is not whether the language model is better than the best human, it is whether they are better than the human who would otherwise do that task. This makes the objection that AI systems are not yet coding long sequences or doing more than fairly basic math on their own a more relevant one. But these systems will continue to improve at all cognitive tasks. The shared goal of the field of artificial intelligence is to create a system that can do anything. I expect us to soon reach it.

A good journalist knows a something about many things but is an expert in nothing. And they often write articles they know very little about or nothing about and research on the fly. 

Worst of all, many times your editor knows LESS about the topic than you. Which means another opportunity for bad or partially correct information to get added to the story. 

Especially in publications like the Atlantic which are more high brow lifestyle magazines mixed with news rather than hard news. 

It’s the nature of the biz.</div>

Quite literally, I think they’re trying to go Meta before anyone else. If they pull it off, though, closing the gap will become increasingly difficult.

But yeah, Zuck officially stated they’re using AI internally. Seems like they gave up on competing with consumer models (or never even started, since llama was OSS to begin with).</div>

They have a decent amount of data, a lot of compute, and shit can change quick. 

Remember pre what was it, llama 3.2 or 3.2 their models were basically garbage. Sure they got used for open source because they were the best open source at the time but still garbage. Then 3.3 dropped and it was close to SOTA. 

Remember when Google was dropping shitty model after shitty model? Now it’s basically blasphemy if you don’t say Google can’t be beat in this sub and elsewhere on reddit.

Under Sergio, the American division was immensely profitable, mostly because they sold the same designs throughout the entire 2010s with minimal changes. In the latter half of the decade, the only vehicles they launched in that timeframe were the DT ram, the MP compass, the RU pacifica, and the JL wrangler. Almost everything else was a refresh of something existing. They even continued to sell Daimler era dinosaurs like the Journey, Grand Caravan, and DS Ram, for basically 100% profits. 

They had no new product development other than “let’s cram a bigger V8 into it,” while Ford and GM refined their designs and (at the time) got ahead in EVs and engine tech. Which made Chrysler a fun little company, but they were clearly set up to merge with someone else. What surprises me is how little they’ve leveraged the Peugeot alliance for platforms/technology. They are still mostly operating as the “FCA arm” and the “PSA arm” with little synergy between the two.</div>

I'm half way through The mind illuminated too. Been trying to catch my thoughts before it leads to anxiety; as well as analysing thoughts during anxiety but progress has been slow. What's the connection with showering your anus though?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body"># I like to experiment a lot with stuff.. when you are 100% overthinking showering your anus with cold water will cool you down instantly.. This is what chatgpt told me:

# 1. Stimulates the vagus nerve

* The vagus nerve runs close to the **anus and pelvic floor**.
* **Cold water** stimulates this nerve, activating the **parasympathetic nervous system** ("rest and digest" mode), which helps **calm the body and reduce anxiety**.
* This is similar to splashing cold water on the face or using cold on the neck (also vagus zones).

# 2. Interrupts overthinking by strong sensory input

* Sudden cold to the sensitive area causes a **sharp physical focus**—you’re pulled out of your head and into your body.
* This can **break rumination or racing thoughts**, anchoring you in the present.

# 3. Improves blood flow to pelvic organs

* The brief cold exposure triggers vasoconstriction followed by vasodilation.
* This can **reduce pelvic tension**, which is often **somatically linked to anxiety** and trauma storage (especially in chronic stress or freeze states).</div>

Mean while this lightweight short fuck is on a ton of steroids and uses whatever his money can buy too look a certain way, like and old whore still slathering on makeup and using baby voice pretending to be 18 years old. It is always funny to me that the Tates and Rogans of the world clearly spend so much time on their appearance and dealing with their fear of getting older and dying. Very manly. Bunch of pussies. While an average working dad doesn't have time to spend 8 hours day on his body and looks, because he has a fucking family to take care off. Narcissistic fuck.

Calling him a purposeful liar and fraud, when he came with actual facts. Some of them needed slight clarification or just a little additional context, but they weren't purposeful lies at all.

I use the web app and generally 4.0 for coding and then copy paste into VS code to run locally before pushing it to github and vercel for live webapp.

I have plus and run in a project. Thing is it tends to foget what it's done. Should i put a copy of the code i.e index.js in the project files so it remembers?

Any tips highly appreciated!</div>

You really want to break everything down into small chunks, not have the entire program in one.

Use CGPT to break the code down for you. I'm not familiar with JavaScript but your index.js could have several functions which can probably be split to independent scripts.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">1) Yes, attach the index.js file would help.
2) Ask chatGPT to make a detail implementation plan for you as a checklist, and a overall project summary.
3) Feed the chatGPT with the project summary , the implementation plan and say you are at step x, implement thus this step. Do this for each step. If a step requires the code snippets from previous steps, attach those snippets to the prompt as well.

So the principle is bring relevant context into chatgpt prompt. It is quite tedious if you use web interface.
 
If you code frequently, open source AI code assistants such as cline ,Roo code, Aider, Zentara Code(coming soon, I am the maintainer), would help you much faster than web UI as you do not need to copy and paste every time. These agents will search for you the relevant files and bring to the context automatically. Using these agents with free models in openrouter may solve your problem.</div>

That 1% left isn't who this technology is for. Honestly though if you're saying it already fools nearly everyone, then next year it definitely will fool everyone.

The day is fast approaching where you might need a degree in this technology to detect if it's real or not.</div>

I have been beating my head against a wall with a complicated script for a week with o4 mini high, and after getting absolutely nowhere (other than a lot of mileage in circles), I tried Gemini. 

I generally have not liked Gemini, but Oh. My. God. It  kicked out all 1,500 lines of code without omitting anything I already had and solved the problem in one run - and I didn’t even tell it what the problem was!

at first i didn’t know what to do with it but [theadvault.co.uk](https://theadvault.co.uk) (free) kinda opened my eyes to some of the potential. i feel like people aren’t using it as a collaborator, they just think it’s supposed to do all their work for them

I also like how he had to stop himself at the end since he’s just so deep in that headspace of understanding what’s coming. Man I wish we could hear Ilya speak more because speaking with such certainty is a rarity in this field even though anyone who really understands the pace of AI progress knows everything he’s saying is 100% true</div>

This is not a "you kids will have no jobs" problem.

This is a "no one will have jobs" problem.

Categorically different, and since it's everyone's problem, everyone is very incentivized to find a solution. The potential solutions are fairly obvious, we either all get a UBI, paid for by the AIs, or we get nothing, and things turn ugly. I don't think anyone wants the second scenario, so we probably get the first.

So I'm not too worried about automation in the long run, but the transition period will be painful. 

I'm far more worried about AGI alignment.</div>

Imagine a country like Germany in the near future, where a company like Tesla has successfully deployed millions of Optimus humanoid robots. These robots are strong, fast, human-sized, and able to perform a wide range of physical tasks.

Now consider this: such a network of humanoid robots, controlled by a single corporation, effectively becomes a standing army. An army that doesn’t need food, sleep, or pay—and crucially, an army whose...</div>

He kept saying ‘If Australians had guns, they wouldn’t be doing the lockdowns’. I’m Australian and it was a pure example of he not knowing who we are as a people and a culture. He kept repeating it like ‘guns’ were the answer to all.

This last week I have just used Aider and Deepseek Reasoner and Chat via the paid API, an have really been impressed by the results. I load a design document as a form of context and let it run. It seldom gets it right first time, but it is a workhorse. It helps that I also code for a living, and can usually steer it in the right direction. Looking forward to the R2.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Trump wants it so bad. He can declare martial law. He did a dragnet in the garment district in downtown LA. Raided a highschool graduation cememony. They are going into downtown LA, a sanctuary city in a sanctuary state doing huge operations to create maximum outrage. 

Martial law he can set kill on sight curfews, turn off internet to regions, and obviously cancel elections. Sending in the military is an incredibly aggressive act. 

Remember how this was supposed to be about getting criminals?  But it's just huge dragnets inside of factories full of people with permits or court dates to get permits who are working and then also high school graduations? 

These aren't dangerous violent people.  They aren't even illegal, but this judge in Louisiana has a deal with trump to rubberstamp cancel ten thousand residency permits at a time for the administration.  If you're legal, you'll be illegal 24 hours after getting picked up.  And in California we want them. And in our city we want them. Whatever happened to our f****** state rights?

You know what's next?  Denaturalization. That means my daughter. I'm an 9th generation yankee. My family has two little towns and several streets named after us from rural oregon to upstate new york. Working class all. My great grandfather was chief engineer on interstate 5 and was a WW2 vet. Three of us in ww1. My direct lineage fought in the 49th new york regiment of buffalo new york in the civil war. My great uncle has a drum in a glass display, one of us was a drummer boy in the revolutionary war. I had my kid abroad and her mom isn't a citizen. Denaturalization means my five year old kid could have her citizenship revoked. My family bled and helped build this country. Trumps family just took and took.  It won't end with this too. If you think you're safe, you aren't- and if you think californians aren't patriots you're wrong twice. 

Our streets did not spontaneously fill with people that made ice run away by magic. We don't want it. Not our governor not our senator not our congressman not our state house not our mayors.

Trump is in Epstein files next day they're doing huge raids and taking away buses of people for not being white. In the beating heart of our pro-immigrant culture.

* He's poking a beehive when the news cycle was turning sour.
* We're essentially in the phase laid out in project 2025 to start using the insurrection act, he's tested the limits of the executive, shown the courts are unable to touch him, &amp; tested seizing legislative power. 

It's time for this part anyway. Might as well be California. He hates us. He'll get the fight he wants here, and we will bleed and we will lose. In a week or two all of you in other states will see what happens if you don't kneel.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">So much horrific shit happens in other countries that people don’t see on their news feed from their couch. 

Back when Venezuela consistently had stocked stores, my dad and I got caught up in a riot during a grocery run. Out of nowhere a giant crowd was mobbing a road, everyone started scattering and thick gas started floating around. We rolled up the windows and peeled out after the crowed cleared the road. 

Couldn’t even see who gassed crowd or where it came from. Not a camera or phone in sight (this was ~2003), so the only remaining evidence is people’s word. 

That shit happens so regularly around the world, we’re lucky it makes national news here in the states. If it happens so often nobody cares, then I’ll be more worried.</div>

Are you trying to say that up to 75% of order CAN be fulfilled by robots? Because that's a LOT different than every single warehouse being run by robots that are fulfilling 75% of order RIGHT NOW.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You're correct about OP misstating it, but Amazon's revenue increased 10% YoY every year for the past 4 years (and going back over a decade) but headcount has actually fallen slightly over the past 4 years. Another 5 years of this and this could be true. (Assuming the revenue growth is retail and not services, which is probably wrong.)

Still though, they don't have to lay anyone off to have 75% of orders fulfilled by robots, not as long as sales are growing. And sales have a lot of room to grow, Amazon is only 40% of ecommerce sales, and ecommerce is only 20% of overall retail. Although Amazon just did surpass Walmart, so that's getting interesting.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; I think I would have heard about 75% of Amazon Warehouse workers being in the unemployment line.

Replacing humans with machines is never sudden... it's slow. Amazon warehouses have had robots since the beginning. Guaranteed 100% of orders are 'touched' by robots, but it's only 75% automated from warehouse to delivery truck. And soon warehouse to your door, if you've seen the recent robot deliveries news.

We all know Amazon warehouse workers' horror stories of pissing in bottles, no AC in a &gt;100 degree (F) warehouse, etc. They have such a high turn-over rate, **they can simply NOT hire new warehouse employees.**

Amazon's growth is also insane, so maybe instead of hiring new people (who would end up as part of mass layoffs) they simply "hire" robots.

% of orders by robots is a number on spreadsheet for Amazon. It doesn't matter if management is fudging the numbers or cherry-picking based on their most automated warehouse. They will continue automating everything and not even turn a profit because they increase company spending to maintain an artificially low level of profits to avoid taxes.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">1. 75% of orders filled by robot doesn’t mean that 75% of humans are fired. 

2. Amazon has a something like a 150% annual employee turnover rate. That means that each year on average *everybody* quits or is fired, a new crop of staff are hired, half of them quit or get fired *again*, and are then rehired. Every year. You wouldn’t hear about massive layoffs because *nobody wants to work there anyway*.</div>

I've seen the videos where there's hundreds of robots dropping orders in boxes, but humans are still in the loop. 'Fulfilled' is doing a lot of lifting in the title here though.</div>
