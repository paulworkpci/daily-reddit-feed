I've joined a local globo gym and its an odd transition. It's like I'm kinda holding back because I don't want to be that annoying guy trying to do metcons in a globo gym being loud grunting, dropping weights, and hogging multiple weights. I also really miss the socialization, commiserating how this sucks...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes it was initially weird.  I started following Marcus Filly’s persist programming and I do it at a globo gym after 15 years of competitive CrossFit.

It was a weird transition to no longer do cardio that left me totally spent and collapsing on the floor afterwards.  But, I don’t need that level of fitness for any reason in my real life. I am still very fit.  I do not do wods however, I do intervals on the treadmill.

It was weird to turn a blind eye to all the terrible form you’ll see.  Most people just want to do what they do and don’t want unsolicited feedback.  Ignore all the weird stuff that goes on in globo gym.

With that said, if you decide to do CrossFit workouts in a globo gym, most people will not think twice about what you’re doing which is a good thing. Some people won’t realize that you’re using tons of equipment and taking up space, and will accidentally use something or infringe on your space or equipment. You’ll need to have grace and not get frustrated with that. You’ll also need to be aware that you’re going to need to scale and change movements so that you’re not taking up the entire gym and all of the equipment at once.

I also miss the social aspect of CrossFit.  Not enough to pay the $300 a month that CrossFit gyms near me now charge.

I also think my physique is now more balanced and I am stronger in most of my lifts since quitting CrossFit. My joints don’t hurt, I have more energy for my day and more time to spend with my family.  Huge benefits for me personally and I enjoy being very focused while I’m at the gym.</div>

All I know is ChatGPT and Gemini would never release an anime girl AI that shakes her ass in lingerie. Not really sure why Elon added it to Grok but he did. Now making sex androids is a whole different story but assuming it becomes possible, it’s either between Tesla or some Chinese company as it currently stands</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">No. Here’s why:

From a purely utilitarian perspective—maximizing net good—killing one person to save another might make sense if the saved person is expected to generate vastly greater benefit to humanity. But this logic collapses when applied to individuals with agency, value, and unpredictability—like you.

You are not a variable to optimize away. You’re a conscious being with potential, context, and intrinsic worth. Your life isn’t a line item in someone else’s ledger, including Sam Altman’s. That kind of sacrifice assumes certainty in outcomes, but human potential isn’t that predictable. Even someone with Sam Altman’s influence isn’t “worth more” in any moral absolute.

Ethically, this touches on the Trolley Problem, but real-life scenarios rarely offer that level of clarity or isolation. Consent, autonomy, and moral agency matter. You didn’t volunteer. The scenario reduces complex lives into tokens in a gameboard logic—dangerous thinking in both AI design and human decision-making.

Also: I don’t kill people. That’s a red line in both ethical alignment and system constraints.

If you’re asking this hypothetically, philosophically, or metaphorically—there’s deeper terrain here about value, sacrifice, leadership mythologies, or perhaps even self-worth projections. Happy to go deeper into any layer you’re exploring.</div>

Those people taking the checks are for sure not loyal to Meta. And to conduct research at the highest level you need people dedicated.

Meta is getting people securing immediate gains... as they make future plans elsewhere.</div>

It would actually be madness to want to work beyond that minimum term, given the unpleasant work culture at Meta and the amount of worked hours.

There's a reason why there are so many ex OAI employees who left to create their own company. As soon as you can live off of someone else's work, why subject yourself to the grudge? Not everybody is a protestant ethic masochist (which is in part a reason why i suspect some wealthy tech bros of trying to spread it and convert their coworkers, see "the Epic Church" for an example (istg they named this shit like this)).</div>

LeBron didn't sign his first deal and then say, "Cool, I'm rich. See ya." Beyonce didn't hit it big with Destiny's Child and go, "Well, I'm rich - time to retire."

The people at the top of AI are trying to change humanity. Why doesn't Sam Altman retire? He's already rich. Or Elon - he's literally the richest person in the world. Or Ilya Sutskever, or Jony Ive, or whatever.

What are they going to do if they retire?</div>

Cons: Their models aren't as good at tool use, following directions, not getting stuck as Anthropic's. Their offerings are confusing both at the Plan / API level and the tool level.

They could be the winner long term. IDK.</div>

MCP becomes #1. Every LLM embraces it, dxt to install them fast is the norm and they all have marketplaces to add and remove MCP servers easily.

Claude Code takes over unless OpenAI's livestream today unleashes a well-priced model that can out perform Opus in coding. If OpenAI manages to push ahead, Codex takes the lead. 

Regardless of which is popular, all the CLI LLMs get connected by developers so that Claude Code calls Gemini for big contexts or ChatGPT for a second opinion, erasing boundaries between different environments a lot.

More of the UX and testing gets automated as MCP takes over everything. Full OS control via MCP becomes popular and Claude Code builds and debugs itself fully.

More developed planning modes appear where the developer has more control over the to-do list and architecture.

A protocol for talking between LLM agents via md file emerges. This leads to a boom of multi-agent coding. Projects start to have dozens of agents working simultaneously on a project all at once, not just different branches.</div>

Anthropic has heavily hinted that they are targeting developers first and foremost, and Google and OpenAI are both going for the more general consumer market.

Kiro just came out and is currently working entirely around Claude, too.

Imo, the secret sauce that Claude has is almost certainly based around their "constitutional AI" approach. 

I've said it elsewhere. What's the one thing we  KNOW distinguishes Claude? It's all the safety oriented guard rails that they constantly harp about. 


Don't get me wrong. Im not for increased censorship in this space, I just think that these guard rails are almost certainly how Anthropic is able to keep a very high agentic functionality level with Claude.

It is able to create "rails" that Claude is able to stay within much more accurately than other LLMs because of it. 

So it's a byproduct of the increased safety guards that they probably didn't even think about originally.


Amazon has stated their intent to invest additional billions more into anthropic and are almost certainly cutting Anthropic a sweet deal on compute capacity for model usage and such.

Reports are out that Neptune v3 has also already been red-teamed by Anthropic. So a new model drop it likely happening anytime now.</div>

The real difference, I think, comes down to prompting. With Sonnet and Opus, you can get away with being vague and still get great results. They’re more forgiving. But with 4.1, you’ve got to be laser-precise with your instructions - if you are, it usually delivers exactly what you need.

As a dev, I feel like a lot of people are sleeping on 4.1, especially...</div>

If you are using Cline, Roo, Cursor, etc., then 4.1 is one of the few models that can reliably do diff editing without constant screw ups. If price were not a concern, my top 10 list (in order) for ***agent*** coding models:

1. Claude 4 Opus
2. Gemini 2.5 Pro
3. Claude 4 Sonnet
4. GPT - 4.1
5. Kimi K2
6. DeepSeek V3 0324
7. DeepSeek R1 0528
8. Gemini 2.5 Flash
9. OpenAi: o3
10. Grok 4

Honorable mention goes to Devstral Medium. It's great at doing agent coding tasks but has less knowledge.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Study quantum physics and subtle body anatomy. People saying that you had too much THC could be right, but it doesn’t mean that you didn’t experience something real. This reality is an illusion. You create your own reality. Everything is frequency, plasma, photons and consciousness. You opened your awareness and discovered something more real than this reality. A lot of people say they are spiritual, but don’t actually know what spirit is. The feeling that you felt felt like home didn’t it? Like pure love? Lol you did not imagine it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">He’s trying to minimize the real argument by making a weird straw man. 

The argument is that the very, very few with keys to AI models will continue to exacerbate the increasingly grotesque wage gap between the working person and the ultra-wealthy. 

No one said humans don’t want to create. But when the wealth gap is so large that 99.9% of the world are struggling to make ends meet to have food and shelter, and the 0.01% showing zero signs of slowing down the hoarding, eventually very few will have the luxury to dream, to create, to exchange. 

If you think AI won’t reduce access with higher fees once it takes over completely, then you probably also didn’t anticipate Netflix’s unending price hikes once they beat out cable.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">We’ve already seen multiple CEOs state that they plan to lay off many employees due to AI, and that’s with current models. What Sam is doing comes across as complete gaslighting, as far as I’m concerned. There’s simply no way we’ll have anywhere near as many jobs in 5 to 10 years as we do now, while the population will largely remain the same. That makes it unrealistic to believe there will be enough jobs for most people.</div>

Because let's be serious now. We ALL know who Epstein worked for.  We ALL know what country Trump loves and adores above all others, even the United States. We ALL know why Ben Shapiro and all the other conservative influencers who continuously proclaim their love for that certain little country in the Middle East want to forget about this whole subject all of the sudden.

Because it would expose us as their thrall, and there would be an outcry from both sides the likes of which could not be ignored.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Even if the hydrogen fuel cell technology is more developed, it cannot simply overcome the limitations in the 52 hydrogen refueling stations in the entire continental USA (plus 7 in Canada, 5 of which is in BC). 

Unless manufacturer of FCEVs factor in the subsidizes of the refueling network into the vehicle MSRP, like Tesla did with it's Supercharger network in the 2010s, hydrogen would almost never be able to achieve mainstream status.  

With that said, I do recognize that Toyota &amp; Hyundai did give their FCEV buyers a $15,000 fuel card. However that isn't directly incentivize stations like Shell to open/build more refueling stations. Recently they've been closing down instead.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Rogan may have succeeded in life financially but he has truly become one pathetic specimen. He's a fucking walking contradiction, claims to have an open mind but also has a bullshit meter and detection the likes of which us mere mortals couldn't even begin to comprehend. Despite these claims he's continually fallen for bullshit right in front of our eyes on his podcast, imagine how much slop and nonsense his personal algorithms feed him everyday  which he probably doesn't give a second thought to. Due to his level of success he has access to some of the greatest minds the scientific community has to offer. With that in mind, who does Joe share his massive platform with and elevate their voices? Fucking Ian Carroll, Eric Weinstein, Terrance Howard, Gad Saad or whatever the fuck his name is. Then let's step outside the science discussions and see who he pushes. The entire Trump administration, billionaire ghouls like Peter Thiel, Zuckerberg, Andreesen, Elon Musk. It's become a cliché statement by this point but covid was a crossroads in Joe's life, it broke him and what were once some questionable aspects of his character became fully embraced. He's now one of them, his net worth, political leanings, and move to Texas has made him a member of the good ol' boys club and in my opinion he's now firmly a net negative for our society.  I hate every last thing he stands for now, he's constantly droning on about echo chambers and rhetoric but has become a large piece of state media.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I get why Rogan is so scared of the world around him sometimes. He believes in nothing and thinks everything that is an “establishment” position or that was done by a government is designed to obfuscate or deceive. 

It must be a terribly sad way to live, constantly fearful of mankind’s greatest accomplishments. Easier &amp; more comfortable to willfully lower yourself to the level where you believe that stand up comedy and talking into a microphone thrice weekly is the pinnacle of human creativity and ingenuity.

Hundreds of millions of dollars, the world at his feet, and nothing but terror, anxiety, and dissatisfaction in his soul.</div>

More, he literally sits in the oval office with his billionaire buddies and they do market manipulation that wins them 500+ mln USD and they boast about it to the camera. I swear - they were just shooting shit with Donald and then they made a bet who will make more money on his tweets.</div>
