I had people ask me the following:

When is it?
What day?
What is it for?
Who is it supporting?
Are we all invited?
How much is it? Like, is it a gold coin donation?
Do I need to bring food?
Do I need to pay?
What morning tea?

I swear there were only maybe 3 people who actually read the thing. I had bright yellow and purple posters above our sign in tablet, on the fridge and at eye level on the wall outside every doorway in the common areas and one person didn’t even *see* one of them.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Depends how you're determining efficiency. A great bioweapon is one you can get people to take voluntarily and not know is a weapon, and even have people defending it and pushing for mandatory consumption of it. If it kills too quickly, it will be obvious what the source of the damage is and people will scramble to find a cure, as well as taking aim at the people who developed and deployed it.

  
If it's the case that the mortality rate of it starts out low, but then slowly grows over time until it reaches a tipping point where a decade down the line most people die from it without even knowing the real cause, is that really inefficient? If you have a 30-50 year plan to massively reduce population, you don't need to kill everyone immediately, you can setup multiple attack vectors with longer term TTK where the symptoms/effects are widely varied enough that the true sources that can be masked. 

The truth is we won't know the full scope of the damage done for many years to come, if at all.</div>

**Submission Statement:** 

New day on Capitol Hill? The Congressional UAP Caucus has been quiet — when not headline grabbing with their separate JFK and Epstein investigations — this entire 119th Congress. Now they say they have a game plan. 

Waiting. Watching. Pressing.

You have a recording of Burlison leaving a scif with burchett and saying, “we found a new form of propulsion,” burchett immediately changed the subject. I wish you could have pushed and asked a follow up. 

Do you know what I’m talking about?

Thanks for doing the work you do.</div>

Do you have a car? Are you open/free for a weekend city trip? Could you drive to Netcong and observe the *daily* UAP activity over there? Ideally, bring a proper thermal camera with you to rule out regular military activity. Netcong is about a 4h44m drive from Capitol Hill. The proper thermal camera gear for definitive evidence is sadly, quite expensive, easily a grand and above to be able to record a proper heat signature.

I was there last month, flew over from the EU to investigate this whole drone story thing, found personal confirmation of these "drones" over at Netcong. (they're nothing like those regular annoying buzzing drones)

But sadly without the proper expensive hardware needed to get definitive proof of their presence there ...

Also, can you ask them about the tridactyls being investigated in Peru? You know, the Nazca "mummies" or they still stuck in the "just a hoax" phase? What about their DICOM files then? How is that explained?

Looks like they're just (very high quality) prosthetics controlled by the muscles that remain in the stump. They're Bluetooth enabled and the hands can still communicate with the forearm bases when disconnected.

It will be a good day for humanity when seamless mental/nerve control of prosthetics is commonplace, but this isn't it unfortunately.</div>

Every atrocity is justified because we’re fighting terrorism. It’s the world we live in now.

We’re the good guys. Civilian deaths are just an unfortunate side effect of winning the war on terror. If you kill 1000 of us, we’re justified killing 50,000 of you because our cause is righteous!

Once we’ve killed all the terrorists and defeated extremist ideology, we’ll simply apologize to those who lost their friends, family, neighbors, homes, businesses, hospitals &amp; schools. They’ll forgive us, because it was all justified. 

Then, we’ll all be friends!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes, but I don't think that a protein is going to fold exactly the same way every time. So when they say there's a 95 percent accuracy, theyare not so much saying we're 95% sure that this is what happens, but more saying 95% of the time the protein will look like this. Nature's messy and chemical reactions don't happen perfectly every time.</div>

Fr though, I really get the feeling that years down the line, when AI Gen has likely already become a very normal thing, all the very loud people who had not-so nuanced views against AI will suddenly all be like, “No, I’ve always liked AI!”.

Various Reddit and Twitter spaces in particular are going to be museums for the vitriol we often see against AI right now.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Anti-AI is basically just a Twitter bubble.

Because of my wife, we're friends with a high-profile photographer I won’t name, don’t want the Luddites coming after her, but she says that in her circle, everyone is excited about AI and what it’ll bring to the table. I liked how she put it - paraphrased:

"A new tool always means there’s a new art waiting to be discovered. How can any artist be against that?"

"But what if this new tool can make photos that are way better than yours, on its own?"

"I don’t know any AI model that does anything on its own. They all need human input to create. And what most people probably miss is that it also needs human input for the output. The human decides what happens to this output so that it matches the artist’s vision as closely as possible.

And it doesn’t matter how good AI gets, this human vision is what makes it art. Even if you had a magical machine that could literally create what you have in mind 1:1, there would still be artists. The people who can create astonishing things in their mind’s eye will always stand above those who can’t.

I think the only ones afraid of this are people who know they don’t have any vision. Their technical skill is the only thing keeping them afloat.

Well yeah, for those people it’s going to suck. But I wouldn’t call them artists in the first place."</div>

On a related but very different note, this is why I'm confident machine consciousness is possible. I don't know if or when we'll figure out how to reach it. However, assuming most people and other higher animals are conscious as they appear to be and not just p-zombies, it must be a pretty wide target to hit. These meat computers come together in all sorts of configurations, with all sorts of wildly different training data, all building our own separate models on varying hardware, and yet consciousness still pops out of pretty much all of them. It can't be all that sensitive to specifics. Whenever we figure out the kinds of computations it entails, hardware should be able to run it just as well as wetware.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yann LeCun and Meta as a whole should be viewed in this light going forward. 

Yann is the chief AI Scientist at Meta and this model was released on his watch. Even bragging about the lmarena scores:

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_good-numbers-for-llama-4-maverick-activity-7314381841220726784-8DUw


He was saying things like: https://youtu.be/SGzMElJ11Cc?t=3507 6 months **after** Daniel Kokotajlo posted: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6Xgy6CAf2jqHhynHL/what-2026-looks-like

Anyone who thinks the future AI systems are safe because of what he's said should discount it completely. He still thinks that LLMs are a dead end and AI will forever remain a tool under human control.</div>

Like I will never look at meta, yann or zuck with credibility on Ai again.

They clearly and knowingly lied. In a context where their lie would EASILY be found out in HOURS. like WTF.

Yann is supposed to be a serious guy. This is not the kind of thing serious people do if they want to be taken seriously.

Like if I EVER see another yann post on this sub again I will simply respond with Llama4 and move on.</div>

Doing one focused task at a time.
No multitasking. No pressure to "optimize everything." Just one thing, done with full attention.

3.	⁠you’re left with the real priorities very quickly, in a small achievable list that is mindful of the other things occupying space in your brain.

                        <div class="comment-body">I've been planning a lot more in my off time/idle time (usually just typing thoughts out in notepad/notes on my phone and exploring my thoughts at a deeper level) which helps get to single task mode easier because I'd honestly spend a lot of time not knowing what to do in an unfocused waste of time transitioning/procrastinating. I noticed the mentality of small wins off the list really adds up momentum that can meaningfully get through stuff. I've also just learned to forgive myself for not getting around to everything and being perfect as long as I know I'm trying to myself and making meaningful improvements along the way. The way I talk to myself in my head is a lot more loving and understanding like you'd talk to a friend as opposed to beating myself up which is something I honestly have done way too much of because the way I've been raised and how far I've gotten on negative motivators, but there's a hard limit there.</div>

And then he completely loses the plot for the next 25. He actually becomes a bit insufferable to listen to because he stops focusing on getting varying degrees of opinions on the show and just starts harping on you Need to be a historian to talk about history etc.. That’s patently false, I probably have done more ww2 research in the last 10 years out of just curiosity but I would never claim to be a historian, and if someone wanted to talk to me about it on a podcast I sure as hell am going to talk about it because I’m interested. 

Rogan has a responsibility to a degree, but not about platforming people. He can do whatever he wants. He just can’t present it as an equal representation. That would be lying. Douglas can call Rogan out on it to do better, but Rogan isn’t required to do anything about it. It’s a disregard for all of our individual agency. If you are too dumb that you consume Rogans show and spout it as fact, that’s on you.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That’s fine and all, but I really did get the sense that he brought up that subject in order to filibuster and obfuscate the actual debate subject for 45 minutes. They could’ve gotten right into Ukraine and Israel, but ended up on a totally different subject for a third of the show.

By all means, criticize Darryl Cooper and Ian Carroll all you want, but neither of them were your debate opponent in the room with you to counter any of your points, so it seemed a bit unfair to attack their proxies via Joe and Dave for associating with them, even though I think they did a fine job.

Also, Douglas criticized Dave for not being an expert on the subjects he comments on and that he hasn’t visited Israel, but Murray couldn’t even remember the names of those two dudes he was criticizing so harshly and admitted to not listening to any of their work because he “doesn’t need to.”

Okay, then why does Dave “need” to visit Israel to comment on the overall situation?</div>

Back when GPT-4 came out, that was it. It was the model. You needed humans to test it, there weren’t viable alternatives. 

Today we have many capable models within OpenAI and hundreds more outside. What used to absolutely require human testing can be completely automated taking a tuned reasoning model to test for common jailbreaks or Safty risks before a human ever touches the checkpoint.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">... This seems counterfactual given the whole point of safety testing AI models is to check for unsafe emergent behaviors that sometimes the models seem smart enough to attempt to hide.

Having other models do that seems... Stupid.</div>

It also wraps all of its answers in an annoying commentary in end to say that “it’s fascinating and cool, right?” Every time I ask it to stop doing this it says ok but it doesn’t.

                                <div class="reply-body">h yes, the long-forgotten ritual of the in-person interview — where resumes go to die and social anxiety thrives. For years, some folks coasted through academia on a steady diet of group projects, online exams, and the occasional "collaborative effort" that just happened to be written entirely by someone else — or now, by a well-trained AI. But now? The reckoning is here.

No more muting the mic to Google answers. No more sending in essays eloquently penned by ChatGPT at 3 AM. Now it’s just you, your questionable GPA, and a hiring manager with dead eyes and a clipboard, waiting for you to explain why you’re a “self-starter” who “thrives in dynamic environments.” And suddenly, that degree you earned without ever learning how to talk like a human under pressure? It doesn’t feel quite so empowering.

These are the same people who once boasted about how school was a “game” and they’d “figured it out.” They outsmarted the system. Now the system wants eye contact, clear articulation, and maybe — god forbid — some actual knowledge. And the sweat? It’s not just from nerves. It’s the cold realization that a six-figure job might require more than whispering sweet nothings into ChatGPT and submitting the output with Helvetica formatting.

So yes, they’re sweating bullets. Because for the first time in a while, there’s no backspace key on body language, no “regenerate response” button for personality, and no way to CTRL+F your way out of a follow-up question.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Quick personal experience with sleep hacking:

Works well:

* Take magnesium before bed.
* No screen 1h before bed.
* Avoid bright light, blue light 1h before bed.
* Vigorous exercice during the day improves sleep quality.
* Sunlight, bright light during the morning/day help your circadian rhythm so also improves sleep.
* Take glycine before bed.
* Always going to sleep at the same time.
* Waking up at the same time.
* First meal at the same time every day (it times other processes in your body with your circadian rhythm)
* No caffeine after lunch.  Reduce caffeine if you are a heavy consumer.

Has worked, worth a try:

* Not eating in the evening / smaller eating window.
* 1/2 tablespoon of honey before bed.
* If you have been heavily reliant on screens like me, use the last hour before bed to prepare for the next day. Prepare everything to remove the friction: your lunch, what cloth you'll wear, etc. If you need to plan, use pen and paper only, and keep that paper close or in view so that it will be one of the first things you see when you wake up.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not OP, but I have huge problems with procrastination, and it's related to emotional avoidance.  I need huge willpower to overcome the bad emotion when I am about to start a task, unless I reach the crisis / panic point where I have to work.

I have recently improved my sleep, I am starting to believe that sleep alone helps me with that emotional management.  Not with more willpower, just the emotion is easier to overcome.  Like sleep deprivation makes my procrastination worse because it amplifies the negative emotion and anxiety when I am about to start a task.

So yes, getting more sleep is more important than I tought.  In my case, going from 6.5h/7h to 7.5/8h is making a difference.  So, just an average 1h more, and I can feel it.</div>
