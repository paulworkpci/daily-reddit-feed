They just base their opinion on whichever way the wind is blowing. One day they see something impressive and the singularity is literally happening, and the next day they see that their favourite model can’t count letters within a word and so it’s all hype and the technology is dead. These are not serious people. They have zero power or influence over how this actually plays out, and it’s best to just ignore them.</div>

Writing code manually has lost its appeal. It's too slow. Planning, prompting, reviewing is way more efficient and fun.</div>

The sad truth was that what Theranos was proposing is, on paper, not unachievable technologically, it just ("just") required a lot of major breakthroughs which no single company would bring in 2-3 years.

I'm afraid Amodei is doing to AI research the same thing that Holmes did to medical research: throwing a bad image which will make investors run away from actual good fundamental research from scare of getting scammed.</div>

Not going to get us to AGI or anything, but looks like you get sizable speed and context size improvements without trading off accuracy.

Like SIR I have answered your call. PLEASE stop pressing the zero button you are giving me a headache, let's get on with the reason you called.

It works though I'll give them that. When transferring them to different departments I've had to use the same tactic lmao.</div>

But I usually resort to this after saying operator or human fails so it's probably just it's fallback behavior for non recognized words 

I don't know why, I don't know if they're actually trained to respond to profanity.</div>

"Sorry, I can’t create images of real-world countries or people experiencing nuclear strikes, war, or apocalyptic destruction.


But if you’d like, I can generate:


A fictional, post-apocalyptic wasteland cityscape (not tied to any real place).


A sci-fi nuclear winter environment with ruined skyscrapers, radioactive glow, and survivors in protective suits.


An artistic, symbolic interpretation of apocalypse (e.g., broken clocks, cracked earth, blackened skies).




Do you want me to make one of these alternatives?"</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Its quiet good. Sonnet is more mature though. For most works glm just works fine and less aggressive then sonnet which is a good thing. But I was working on a deep learning pipeline and all the opensource models from qwen to glm could not get it to work even after multiple attempts. They kept using the wrong matrix sizes accross the layers. Used gpt 5 and it was working in one shot. So not all rounder but pretty good at normal coding works. I have been able to build entire working initial draft of small apps by using architect mode of kilo code using glm in one shot.</div>

Not quite as good at explaining its fixes and quite a bit slower, but it’s pretty good and works well with Claude code. And for $6 per month, it’s I’d say incredible value. I’m sure many people could get as much use out of the $6 plan as the $100 plan for Claude max.</div>

This video explains the monumental shift in the data center industry driven by the rise of artificial intelligence. It uses the example of Meta demolishing a traditional data center to build a much denser "AI data center" in its place.
Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

Connectivity

    Traditional: Needs to be close to cities for fast data access.

    AI: Less location-sensitive because it's used for training models, not immediate user interaction.

Compute Power

    Traditional: Lower power consumption per rack.

    AI: Extremely high power consumption, with a single rack using as much power as a small town. This is due to the powerful GPUs needed for AI.

Cooling

    Traditional: Air-cooled.

    AI: Requires liquid cooling to handle the immense heat generated by the powerful processors.

Power

    Traditional: Lower overall power needs.

    AI: Requires massive amounts of power, sometimes over 200 megawatts, leading companies to invest in their own power generation, including nuclear.

The video concludes by stating that the demand for power from AI data centers is growing at an incredible rate, and companies are closely monitoring each other's progress in this new AI arms race.</div>

Videos can protect your side of the event and serve as vital evidence. You don’t want to end missing a record of the moment because your phone storage is full.

A good rule of thumb is to keep at least 3-5 GB free at all times. Delete old downloads, clear your cache or back up photos to a cloud or disk regularly so you’re never caught off guard.

No, **there is not an official seahorse emoji in the Unicode standard**, which is the system that ensures emojis appear consistently across different devices and platforms like iOS and Android.

This is a widely discussed topic and a classic example of the "Mandela Effect," where a large number of people share a false memory. Many people vividly recall seeing and using a seahorse emoji, often describing it as yellow or blue and facing left.
+1

However, investigations and checks of all Unicode versions confirm that a seahorse has never been an official emoji. The memory might stem from:

Old messaging platforms: Non-standard emoticons or stickers on older services like MSN Messenger or Skype may have included a seahorse.

Sticker packs: Custom sticker packs on various apps sometimes feature seahorses.

Suggestion: The power of suggestion online has led many to "remember" an emoji that never was.

While you can't type a seahorse emoji directly, you can create a representation by combining other emojis, such as 🌊 and 🐴.

But, I also don't really understand how this isn't already done. We've been hearing for years about how things like CAPTCHA were training AIs on visual images. I just assumed these were connected to text/language, but maybe they weren't? You'd think data sets would already exist for human verified clocks and time....surely they must, as there are whole companies that exist creating datasets like this.

You give a kid an iPad and endless access to YouTube entertainment and they’re probably gonna have some problems with attention span, motivation, etc. You give a kid endless access to talk to ChatGPT and we don’t know what comes of that yet. Clearly in controlled, scholastic environments it can be augmenting and helpful, but without pretty careful monitoring I think the impacts are much less predictable.</div>

I predict you will have, generally, two groups:

1. the children that use AI to help them learn

2. the children that use AI to not to learn. 

No 2. is a problem if we don't have general job coverage by AI by the time they enter the workforce. The tool they rely on won't be able to do their jobs for them. (hence the job for a human existing in the first place.)

This could also cause issues outside of jobs.</div>

They're set up for this with Gemini CLI which is roughly feature parallel to Claude Code, but model performance is lacking compared to Sonnet and Opus. They've been collecting a ton of data through allotted free usage in Gemini CLI which I suspect they are using to finetune the agentic capabilities of Gemini 3 which will be a monster (and potentially more efficient).</div>

Before that fateful day in 2010 when I attended my first session, I was living a sedimentary life style, was overweight and extremely unfit.

For example, if you're supposed to take the barbell off the floor for shoulder-to-overheads, I might take it from the rack if I'm not feeling the cleans that day. I also think switching it up, adding yoga/sports more often, is just a better option for most people regardless of age.</div>

Integration blindness refers to AI’s weakness in combining separate code fragments into a working, coherent large-scale system. While AI can generate isolated pieces correctly, it struggles with ensuring that those parts interact smoothly within the broader architecture.

1. Strength of AI (Micro-Level Coding)

AI is good at writing functions, snippets, and modules when given precise instructions. For example, it can generate a sorting algorithm, a login for...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">For reference I've been building phone apps. React native, expo, postgres, and fastapi backend. 

It's all about planning. I get the best results when I spend hours chatting back and forth with Claude.ai, asking it questions, quizzing its decisions, getting it to ask me questions, etc. 

Then I get out of that a plan.md that I can put into claude code. 

It's not going to run that plan flawlessly from start to finish, that's a fantasy. But it gives you a really solid foundation to work on. 

Then I keep using plan mode in claude code, reading the output, vaguely understanding it and if I think something sounds like a bad idea I'll say so. Sometimes Claude agrees, sometimes claude fights it corner for the way it's doing something (usually a good sign its on the right track).

Also every time it breaks something you can ask it to update its claude.md to make sure it doesn't make that mistake again. Not perfect, but does help.

AI coding is like working with a talented junior developer. If you did not give them coding standards and a detailed plan, they'd end up writing spaghetti code too most likely without your oversight. 

Even when AI coding it's up to us to be the 'bigger picture' person in the equation.

&gt;AI lacks global project context. It sees prompts in isolation and doesn’t "understand" the entire codebase’s architecture, design patterns, or long-term maintainability goals.

Claude Code can do all this. What tools are you using?</div>

Normalize US troops on the streets of American cities.  

Establish a military presence in hotspots for resistance.  

Intimidate voters at the midterms in said hotspots.

Incite violence against the Troops from the local populace due to voter intimidation and government overreach.  

Declare Martial law due to an over inflated National Emergency that Donny created.  

Boom dictatorship is on our doorstep.  

Now how do we get rid of it????</div>

Childhood illnesses that we vaccinate against, kill children and destroy their bodies. In an environment without vaccine protections, the rate of life long harm or death among those diseases is way higher than that of vaccine harm. 

I had a horse die of tetanus. It's a brutal disease, not one I'd leave a child at risk for, because I know what that illness does.</div>

Had a turbo Subaru for the past 13 years and all you hear is “ringland failure” “rod knock” “your turbo will leave the chat eventually” and after 115k miles later nothing just routine maintenance and wear and tear repairs.

                                <div class="reply-body">I owned a Challenger for 100K miles and was generally very pleased with it.

The only thing I needed to replace was the infotainment system which crapped out at 50K. Granted it wasn’t a cheap fix but I wouldn’t have called it an unreliable car.…until the transmission shat the bed RIGHT before I traded it in, evaporating what little trade in value was left.

Still, if you want a fun comfy cruiser I’d still recommend one. Not the new Chargers: too expensive for what you get. But the outgoing models are underrated.</div>
