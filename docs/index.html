                <div class="post-content">An interesting thought I had while showering today: which cars have the biggest leap from base model to their top trim? For example, a base rental-spec Ecoboost Mustang to a GTD. Or a bare bones V6 Charger vs. a Hellcat Red-eye Widebody. Even a fleet spec F-150 to a King Ranch. You get the idea. Doesn't have to just be performance wise, could also be luxury/tech features. Just the cars where the top trim is so different from the base they may as well be different cars.

Like okay, when later? After lunch? After scrolling for 2 hours? After I die??

Every time I ask myself that, I realize there’s never an actual “later.” It’s just my brain’s way of saying “I don’t wanna.” So now I just do one tiny version of the thing right away. Like if I need to clean my room, I’ll just pick up one shirt. That’s it. And somehow, it breaks the spell.

It’s wild how much procrastinatio...</div>

Then, months later, we all saw the gradual decline of the feature until it became very obvious that it was not the same anymore.

Anyway, I think it’s been over a year at this point since that happened.

The only other thing that we’ve had that was somewhat of a breakthrough was Sesame AI, but that was many months ago. In regards to voice conversation progress, it seems to have been stagnant lately.

                        <div class="comment-body">the main thing that's missing is the full duplex experience.. you talk, the AI discerns, interrupts when appropriate. Right now, the front end app only detects your end  of sentence (your pauses etc) and send the whole input to backend, the chatbot at the server then produces token that mimics conversation dynamics (pauses, the uhm and ahh and laughs), all computed in batch, rather than naturally occurring as a result of real-time processing. And that make it hard to have a real conversation that feels natural with AIs.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Speech-to-speech models don’t work like that, only STT-TTS do.  STS models work in realtime at the audio subtoken level, usually audio frames of 10-50 milliseconds.

Any perceived delay is due to a) waiting for gaps in speech or b) latency while response tokens are converted back to audio and relayed over the network.  The amount of available compute dictates how smooth the conversation will be and how quick interruptions or opportunities to speak are detected.  As speech model providers need to ration compute, they implement silence detection as that reduces GPU load and by default makes the model appear to politely wait for you to finish speaking.  There is nothing innate in an STS model that would prevent it from interrupting you or speaking over the top of you. In fact it can sometime be heard when network latency is high and the model continues speaking because it hasn’t detected your interruption yet.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Full duplex with real barge in is the missing piece. You need streaming ASR, partial-token LLM output, and streaming TTS that can be interrupted mid-phoneme, all under \~150 ms round trip. Practical bits: WebRTC for low-latency audio, on-device VAD/AEC so you can talk over playback, and diarization so it knows who’s speaking. Keep the mic wired if you can; Bluetooth adds delay. If you’re building, pair Deepgram (ASR) with ElevenLabs or Coqui (TTS), and something like OpenAI’s Realtime API or a local model for incremental tokens; DreamFactory helped me expose session state and auth-protected endpoints so the voice client can sync context without extra glue code. Also, start intent inference during the user’s last word, not after a long pause. When those pieces click, the vibe stops feeling turn-based. Full duplex with sub-150 ms latency is the next breakthrough.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A significant portion of people don't understand how to verify anything, do research, look for objectivity, and are incapable of imagining a world different than the one they are intimately familiar with. They speak in canned, sound bites that they've heard and don't even understand but if the sound bite seems to be attached to a message that soothes them - in this case, AI will all go away - they will repeat every single one of them. 

You see it when they talk about the water/energy use. When they talk about stochastic parrots (incredibly ironic). When they talk about real intelligence, or say something like "I don't call it artificial intelligence, I call it fake intelligence, or actually indians! Right! Hahahaha".

 This is all they want. Peers who agree with them, assuage their fears, and no discussions more complex than trying to decide exactly whose turn it is with the soundbite.</div>

After burning through hundreds of hours and way too much money on subscriptions, here's what I learned.

# Important stuff

**Tell AI exactly what you want**   
  
Stop hoping it'll figure things out. Write 1-2 clear sentences about what needs to happen before giving any task. "Fix the auth bug...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Summary:
After testing every major AI coding tool for 6 months, the key takeaways are:

Be extremely specific with prompts (mention exact files, functions, and lines).

Always plan detailed file-level steps before coding.

Give AI small, focused chunks — not your whole repo.

Review code twice: yourself first, then with an AI reviewer.
Best combo: Traycer for planning, Claude Code for coding, and CodeRabbit for reviews.</div>

The part that feels off is the social side. There isn’t much warmth or encouragement from the coaches, and the more experienced athletes mostly keep to their own circles. There’s definitely an “inner circle” vibe, they all chat, cheer each other on, and get that easy acknowledgment, while the beginners or mid level just grind quietly in the background.

Used to have this at my old CrossFit gym. Was there for seven years and made some good friends, but there was still the ‘cool club’ of rx and owners etc who would not welcome others. 

For various reasons I left and started at another gym and they don’t have this vibe - everyone is welcoming and there is no clique. And no, I haven’t changed my approach or friendliness levels between the two gyms. 

Looking back now the original gym very much had a high school vibe that I’m glad to have left.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It matters how you define ego. The original meaning comes from Freud. He intended it as an integrating function of personality. Ego is the "adult" that mediates between moral dogma (parent or superego) and impulses (child or id). That's psychoanalysis theory.

Ego then became popular slang as a term for sense of self. One can have a bruised ego, a big ego, a sensitive ego. One can be an egomaniac. Etc.

In Western Buddhism go is often used to refer to the tendency of clinging to belief in a self. It's our confused tendency to assert a self and try to confirm that self.

You don't seem to be offering a definition. You criticize the idea of oneself separate from ego, but then propose the very same view. Then you propose that one can distance oneself from "thoughts and ego".

Coming from Buddhist background, I don't see ego as a thing so much as a tendency of grasping and solidifying. Ego need to be ruled or separated from because it's not actually there. But as a convenience of language we label that confusion ego.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You’re saying I am contradicting myself when in fact i didn’t really do that. What is you at the core is not ego. Yet at the same time trying to get rid of it is still the works of the ego. Therefore what you consider ego and yourself is not different. You just tend to put the blame on the ego when in fact ego is not separate from you. Only if you touch the core of who you are can you get a glimpse that you’re not the ego.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">TLDR: Better context management and organization into notes basically. Grows over time instead of compressing context over time like older methods which causes the loss of valuable details. It intelligently decides what to keep or remove.

Anthropic probably did a similar thing with claude code. While this seems like an obvious thing to do I guess it was hard to make an algorithm that can determine what is actually useful information. Impressive stuff, looks like we are slowly solving context.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">That is certainly encouraging. This looks like a smarter way to context engineer. If you combine it with post processing and the other "low hanging fruit" of model development I am sure we'll see far more affordable gains.

What is easy to miss is that for the actual *use cases* of stuff like this taking in data that exists in a very specific environment like a lab or a human body, and giving it this kind of context engineering would see far more significant gains.

Mixture of Experts need not be written off quite yet if context engineering gains so much.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">That's because of the ubiquity of the underlying resources which AI relies upon. The internet is already there - AI doesn't need to be built out like the internet did. Once you have an AI model all you need is a bunch of computer and network bandwidth. The users don't need to do anything special at all.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">What is your point? If you're just explaining a core driver of the difference that's fine, but that doesn't invalidate the comparison or make it less relevant. Telephone infrastructure played a critical role in the speed of internet adoption among other things. Technology makes it easier to make and distribute other technology. OP seems to be saying that AI will quickly become ubiquitous which (as we see with the Internet) will accelerate development and feedback loops.

I'll add on to that and say that when slow development and feedback loops meet potential, you get the kind of speculation that lead to the dot com bubble. This is a big reason why the comparison is relevant.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I am currently debating swapping to a pro account to see the limits. I have been killing my bank using the API and currently am at around $160 for usage, I believe I probably could have used a pro account and not hit my limits but also am not sure. I am worried about spending the extra 200 but also in the end I feel like I am going to spend almost 400/month in calls just to do random testing that I am bored with .... I go through about 100 million cached tokens per session so I am a "heavy" user I think. 

If I end up getting a pro account I'll let you know but I have also been thinking of just getting a second plus account like you did.... GPT-5-Mini is worth it, but gpt-5-codex is very expensive while also very good.

API allows me to set limits and such which is great if I don't want to spend TOO much on a project but I have spent $3 in a single prompt out once, so you really can burn through some dollars if you are just sending out full projects to it (which I am)</div>

People view these as fun little competitions, but each one it knocks out is just one step closer to becoming good enough to where it beats all future competitions.

There is a take off point where it starts creating its own discoveries. Who knows when that point will be reached, but I would hazard a guess it's just down the road.</div>

Most people don't understand inventions from 5 centuries ago in the latter sense (telescopes, microscopes, engines). But, key to inventions is this former sense - knowing how to use them and make them work. So, if AI can invent a nano-suit you wear and don't feel, but which diagnoses and heals and repairs your DNA in real time, you really need not understand how it works or what AI did to get it there.</div>

From "simple" things, like new moves in chess and go that even the top human experts are not able to understand, at all, not even tangentially. AlphaEvolve developed a new matrix multiplication algorithm that is faster then the one we used for 50 years. AlphaFold discovered protein structures that would have taken us thousands of years to discover.

Only applies if your car has keyless entry/start function.

If you thought "well duh" then well done, you passed.

Just in case the problem isn't clear RFID/ keyless/ relay car theft is where the signal from the key is boosted to unlock and start the car without it being physically inside the car. Allowing criminals to drive off with your car...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">For the record the key doesn’t actually use RFID, it’s an RF transponder that actively broadcasts 24/7 which is how it’s able to unlock the car without a button being pressed.

The “RFID blocking” case is a simple faraday cage that blocks all RF signals in question from being transmitted outside the cage/case. It’s effective with relay attacks as well because they need an active transmission from the key fob to bounce and transmit to the vehicle.

Sorry, I work in the RFID industry and the term being used as a catch-all bugs me lol.</div>
