I think sam is reconsidering it just now because 99% didn't pay and the podcast is not profitable. So i got it for free for like 5 years but felt i got so much out of it wanted to pay to support the podcast so paid 50 dollars per year for a couple of years now. I wish more places had such policy and no ads.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Or you should just understand that what you’re putting in won’t be reciprocated to the same degree, and find peace with that. 

Your capacity to give may be greater than another’s, but that is not necessarily a disconnect in the amount of joy the other derives and appreciates from the relationship. The measure is whether or not you can be satisfied with the relationship as is, or if you stopped contributing, would the loss be greater than the effort required to maintain it, even if unbalanced. 

Life and relationships are not 50-50, and if you’re constantly trying to balance the scales, you’ll be robbed of the joy of the present; as well as what might have been. Love fully and unconditionally, and sometimes that will sting you, but the highs you’ll experience far outweigh the monotony of playing games instead of living your life.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think part of it is a mismatch in energy, but also some people view friendships like transactions, which isn't healthy.

If one of my friends plans a fun outing for me to join them on, I view that as a gift. I am very grateful and appreciative of any gift from a friend. If that same friend started to passive aggressively guilt trip me for not reciprocating by planning the next trip, then I'd probably start wishing I never joined them on their previous trip.

Some people are so concerned about what's 'owed' them by their friends that they end up alienating those friends. Giving without expecting anything in return is the best way to build strong lasting friendships.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's been that way for a while now, autonomous fine-tuners/evaluators have been the target of a lot of research, [for example](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ohJxgRLlLt). The main crux tends to be about whether the gains compared to supervised loops generalize (rather than being spiky) and whether they actually go far in practice. ICM's advantage is that it's elicitation though, so the stronger the base model the better the gains, so it should be scalable in theory, at least for the kinds of problems they've tested it on.

[One of the researchers adds](https://x.com/jiaxinwen22/status/1933196263463452818):

&gt;want to clarify some common misunderstandings  
\- this paper is about elicitation, not self-improvement.  
\- we're not adding new skills --- humans typically can't teach models anything superhuman during post-training.  
\- we are most surprised by the reward modeling results.  Unlike math or factual correctness, concepts like helpfulness &amp; harmlessness are really complex. Many assume human feedback is crucial for specifying them. But LMs already grasp them surprisingly well just from pretraining!

Seems like the automated better version of RLHF through elicitation and it works for more fuzzy concepts like helpfulness, something RLHF was originally designed for and seemed like a no-brainer topic for language models to automate labeling for, seeing as they're already pretty powerful at language.

Also cool to see Jan Leike as a contributor, seeing as "RLHF but automated, better and achievable by a smaller model" was exactly what he was advocating for research-wise for a long while now.</div>

* Persona Role
* Scenario Context
* User input
* System Message
* Specific Task
* If/Else Logic
* Iteration
* Output Format
* Structured Data Output

And loads more...

Each of these you drag on and connect the nodes/ to create the flow. You can then modify the data on...</div>

Any time I see prompt libraries or prompt builders I just don't get it. Is writing a prompt yourself or having AI write a prompt for you a big enough problem for folks that it requires a dedicated solution?</div>

Trump doesnt give a shit about most countries in the world, he's just the most pro zionist president ever and thus supports any war that israel wants. His son in law Jared Kushner basically dictates his policy towards israel and whatever israel wants, he supports. This isnt about trump wanting war, this is about trump (and most of our government tbh) being controlled by israel.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The bar is on the absolute floor for this car, it is clearly well behind its rivals from both startups (lucid) and traditional automakers (i4/i5, taycan, etc.), but they've somehow one-upped themselves with this "new" launch.

New paint, marginally better efficiency, nvh, new wheels, front camera, ambient lighting, and the adaptive headlights. Alongside very subtle (and I mean very subtle) styling tweaks to the plaid. All features already available on the significantly cheaper model 3, save for the air suspension and range, and nowhere near enough to make up the gap to the competitors now.

I'm not even asking them to change up the exterior design language, I think its still a pretty good looking car, I don't even mind if they stick with the minimalist interior, but the materials at that price point are unacceptable, and it inherits nothing from the cybertruck. No steer by wire, no rear wheel steer, no 800v, no turn signal stalk, no powertrain updates, I genuinely cannot fathom why you'd buy this car today. IMO the blacked out front fascia is worse than before. 

Even if you want FSD and like the tesla interior or whatever just buy a model 3 performance for significantly less, if you want the acceleration buy a '21/'22 model s for less than half the price, its like 98% the same exact car. That blue is nice though.

Also, it's funny that the yoke is now not an option at all.</div>

This is the same question you could ask of basically any flagship vehicle. 

Why buy a 7 series when the 3 series is half the price?

Why buy an A7 when an A3 is half the price?

The Model S will obviously be more comfortable, more luxurious, quieter, and quicker. Is that worth paying double for, no, but luxury cars are rarely "worth" the price difference in an objective sense.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Omg my god I was in a hot tub in Hawaii with my gf and some dude sits down and starts chatting.. and asks us where we're from.

So of course we say Los Angeles and he goes

"Beautiful city to visit but I can't stand the politics, how do you feel about it."

And my normally quiet gf looks up and goes "I love it and I wouldn't live anywhere else.."

Dude then proceeded to try and start a political conversation so he could shit on LA and we just ignored him.

Like bro, you're in the most beautiful place in the US, relaxing in a hot tub... and you want to shit on "Commie LA" to pass the time?

Talk about being obsessed.</div>

She thought the risk was low.

I have cystic fibrosis and had crazy pain in my chest and they asked me to go get scans.

The radiologist came out to see us personally -- I didn't even know he as on-site, I thought it was just a building with the machines to get things performed.

He was like, do not pass go, forget about 200 dollars, get your ass to a hospital. You should concern yourself with nothing but wasting no time getting from here to there.

I was like 25-ish, I think? And they theorized it was in my leg, having a sedentary job, and got caught in my lungs like a filter.

Two big clusters of baby clots.

SIX MONTHS of three to four blood draws a week tracking PT/INR.

I have ankle tendons for blood vessels, now they're all collapsed and dried up worms on the sidewalk lol</div>

But when the doctor already dismissed our concerns, or if we can't get another appointment until God knows when because we can't get more time off from work, or the doctor is booked out, or we simply can't afford an additional appointment, what the hell are we supposed to do instead? Just shrug our shoulders and sit there in the dark with **NO** information at all because the doctor doesn't like it when we Google/use ChatGPT?

                                <div class="reply-body">You’re failing to understand the American political system with this comment, though. It’s set up to where the majority doesn’t really win because of the Electoral College. Most people in “decided” states don’t even vote because their vote doesn’t matter. 

Beyond that, the courts have decided to allow unlimited corporate contributions to shape elections through a controlled media. So the few people’s votes who actually do matter are fed endless streams of bullshit and lies, with truthful messaging being crowded out financially. We have only been given an illusion that we live in a democracy, with most politicians just serving these monied interests. People’s voices all screaming in unison cannot be heard over the sounds of the money truck being backed up to these politicians’ doorsteps, whether they wear a red or blue tie. 

People aren’t just “closing their eyes”; the system is rigged against us, and there’s not really a way to change it without a full-scale revolution, and that won’t happen until shit truly hits the fan. 

Without ranked choice voting instead of first-past-the-post, limitations of corporate financing, limitations on any contributions (public campaign financing), elimination of the electoral college, proportional representation, open primaries, and independent redistricting commissions, the game is stacked against the people. The people know it and react accordingly which gives the appearance to an outsider that we have our eyes closed.</div>

Musk, on the other hand, puts on this baron’s tone that is entirely fake and over-enunciates some vowels with a lordly timbre, like a techno Mennonite. Whenever he assumes that tone, he is vulgar.</div>
