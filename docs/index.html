this subreddit is all about trying to get off your phone and look at your surroundings, but all I see are people angry at the internet while they remain on it.

                        <div class="comment-body">This sub is so much bad energy, i keep thinking I need to unsubscribe and then forget. 

I think I wanted a positive/encouraging sub celebrating a more mindful, intentional lifestyle that you are in control of yourself instead of being controlled by big tech. I'm still a tech enthusiast, but how about ebooks and an ipod instead of instagram and spotify? Stuff like that.  And people could cheer each other on in living differently and setting a good example for those around us.

I realized that I'm the wrong demographic for this sub. I dislike the current social media slave culture and wanted to find my people who choose to largely live outside of it, and instead this just seemed geared towards those are completely stuck even if they dislike it. And I mean, people are here precisely because they know how much it sucks and I'd guess you get pretty negative from living in a manner you actually hate.

I guess it's kind of like if you beat a drug addiction, a rehab probably isn't the best place to hang around even though you all share a mindset of wanting to be sober. I see people saying stuff like "can you even survive without instagram?" and it reminds me of thinking that i can't live without certain self-destructive substances. I get that it really and truly feels that like you can't live without... but it's still horrifying to see someone in that condition (i realize this is maybe 95% of people with social media though).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">yeah fair, people just end up leaning into their doom and gloom too much. I badly fumbled my internet usage before yesterday and then managed to spend the entire next day reading through an entire book, a feat that I haven't accomplished before for \~8 years. There's bad, there's good. But reddit is just another feed, and it's easy to lean into it, into what feeds it.  

  
The rehab center analogy is very apt. I wonder if there is a better place, or if it too would just end up being a timesink... I suppose you must already have seen them but Reject Convenience has really good videos about healthier digital lifestyle, including switching to things like dumbphones. Maybe his forum is a better space for you?</div>

Ha ME TOO! I'm unsubscribing now. I need more stuff that inspires me to get offline, not ragebait. 

I'm going to try to do more of the challenges in /r/offlineday - it's a quiet sub but those may actually help me out.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Depends on how he defines luxury items.

If he means items that are expensive to create and therefore expensive today, then many of those will get cheaper too.

But I suspect he means something else: He probably means things that have **artificial** scarcity and where they're sold at a price that is a large multiplum of any reasonable production-costs already -- because the scarcity is part of the product, and there's little actual competition for the product since the brand is a huge part of the point.

When a handbag costs $5000, the price is already decoupled from production-costs, so if production-costs fall to half or something, there's no reason that would impact the price of the luxury handbag at all.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That’s interesting because most luxury goods, which have an enormous markup over their original cost, rely on artificial scarcity. If more people could afford them, they would lose their exclusivity and, therefore, their perceived value. The only logical response is to raise the price even further.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There are a lot of luxury items that are intentionally made with older inefficient methods by hand or with old machines. This limits the production output and commands a high price because they are expensive to make and limited. I suspect he's mostly talking about these kinds of things.

Some examples:

* Rolex Watches - They make a certain number of watches per year, parts of the process are done by hand, and they claim they can't really increase production without sacrificing quality. So they just don't increase production.
* Japanese Denim - Lots of Japanese denim is made on old looms imported from the US in the 1950s and carefully maintained. They are much less efficient than modern looms, but give unique properties to the denim. That's why you're looking at $300-400 USD for these jeans.
* Fountain Pens - Many are hand assembled and hand tuned, and at the high end there is hand done art work. They may apply urushi lacquer that has to be applied in multiple coats by hand. (there is also lots of artificial scarcity created in the fountain pen world, but I'm talking about the upper end)

  
I wouldn't say the scarcity is artificial in any of the above examples, assuming Rolex is telling the truth that they don't believe they can scale up production and maintain quality. There are just a limited number of people who know how or are willing to do the work. Or you have old machines that are hard to replicate.

These things do have a higher perceived value because some human had to be skilled at a craft to create them, and that limits the output.

  
But yes, you are right there are lots of big luxury brands that totally create artificial scarcity and it could probably be scaled up a lot more if they wanted to.</div>

Then it hit me: AI is trained on massive datasets, and the vast majority of images online depict **right-handed people**. Since left-handed people make up only **10% of the population**, the AI is way more likely to assume **everyone is right-handed by default**.

Too many folks are petrified of hard conversations. You know your friend is unwell so you write em off as flakey and move on with your life. Doesn’t sound like it was much of a relationship worth keeping.

Have the hard conversation folks. Call out crappy friends behaviors, base how you move from the situation after their response.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think a huge part of it is people are unable/unwilling to see the other side. Everyone takes everything personally and after a while begins to see minor annoying behavior as malicious or 'toxic'. Two friends can end up seeing each other as being flakey/uncaring/toxic because they aren't willing to talk about what is bothering them and they aren't willing to think of themselves as not a victim of the behavior. We are all prone to this sort of thinking and unfortunately social media promotes the hell out of this.

There are endless posts with comments such as "your friend is 15 minutes late to everything and always has an excuse, they don't value you or your time. They are selfish and you have to cut them off" with everyone agreeing, then you'll see another post about the same type of situation from a different preceptive with comments like "your friend is toxic because you have so much on your plate and despite working 2 jobs with kids you still try your best to make it to events to spend time with them but they don't appreciate it and don't value you. They are selfish and you have to cut them off." There's no thought about how both people could be right and wrong or how both people should be more understanding towards the other. 

With friendships you just have to always consider the other side or eventually you will end up seeing everything as toxic and everyone needing to be cut off. (Not to say there aren't legitimate reasons to cut people off because there are of course)</div>

He noticed a lot of it, some of it he explained there was more going on that we weren't seeing, so of it he wasn't aware of until I said something. All and all, left the conversation feeling good.

Too bad when he talked to her about it, she turned him on us and he cut us all out of his life. Whatever dude, you want to choose a manipulative narcissist over your friends? We tried, you chose, I hope we were wrong, but a group of us all saw the same thing, so I doubt it.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/PositiveSong2293:

---

Jeremy Corbell says Commander Fravor of the tic-tac incident was told by the CIA that the craft he saw was Lockheed Martin technology.


Corbell asserts that the email was 'passage material.' He's saying it can't be human technology, which is rather close minded.

                                <div class="reply-body">Negative, we don't know how it works. I saw a "patent" that was about a huge electromagnetic beast that lay in the ocean, the drone (being the tictac) was stuffed with aerogel and equipment that would react to these magnetic fields. 


When they push the field or change it in a certain way the craft zips to that location. 


Now this may not be real, but if it was proven to work it would make a super light aerogel balloon move faster than any turbine powered craft could. 


Fact is, they're using tech we don't know about, clearly they aren't dealing with energies beyond our comprehension if they are doing it. It's clear that it's a tech they figured out and simply haven't released yet. 


Greer has been saying it was a Lockheed craft for years now. 


Seems he may be right. </div>

Did someone send an email to Fravor making a claim that they read something? Literally anyone can do that. Did they themselves read classified documents, did they hear it from someone else, etc. Its all just circular reporting and conjecture unless they have evidence. They don't. And those that claim to magically can never release it or it is soooo low quality that it could be anything.</div>

The US government has a long history of attempting to convince the general public that UFOs are just their secret technology, literally all the way up until Kirkpatrick who did a media tour claiming the same thing in only slightly different words.

Add that to the other allegations against him- Plus his ownership of Miss Teen USA- Plus his friendship with Maxwell... Its pretty clear he's one of the more frequent customers. 

It makes a lot of sense when you ask the question "Why has Trump, who goes after everyone for even the most petty thing never gone after the Clintons about Epstein?" and the answer is it's not something he wants looked at.</div>

But it’s crazy all the stuff these powerful people on all sides of the political and social spectrums most likely get up to.

I'd limit the scope of what you're trying to solve, start very small, pick one small part of your day where you can get through it without checking your phone, even if it's for 20 minutes, and then slowly build on to that.

For example, if you watch a show, go for a walk, or hang out with friends, set a timer for 20 minutes where you engage in those activities without checking your phone.

It's really important to pick small wins you can achieve and slowly retrain your attention, emotional regulation, and capacity to deal with less stimulation.

Chances are phone usage is helping you in many ways and trying to quit cold turkey is going to result in guaranteed failure, so please be very careful about that temptation.

Abstract rules are only as strong as the desire to respect them, that's why most of them fail unless they're cultivated very carefully and mindfully.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Its just hard to find people who are consistently in the other end of the AI prediction scale. 

In most communication (SOME, News, blogs etc.) it helps the reader/consumer to understand different points of view - and the more clear the opposing views are - the easier it is to understand the broad strokes for a regular person not following the AI-space already. 

However when you then start your own AI-journey you should also realise Garys opinions are probably designed to fit that media-mold to get attention and therefor superficial at best. If you already understand the different sides and opinions in regards to AI-development, and care about the technology - his opinions  can quickly be ignored.</div>

At the very least, I think it means you need to spend some time going through your accounts and curating your feeds with a fine-tooth comb to show only the content you want it to show.

At most, I think it means you need to spend more time completely offline.

You really can't control what other people talk about online. But you *can* control how you respond to it. You have the agency to make changes that improve your well-being.</div>

I made a thread on r/singing and because it was Carrie Underwood at the inauguration, the thread was overwhelmed with "Nazi" accusations and all of the actual singing discussion talk was buried at the bottom. This isn't "the wrong kind of politics", it's just spam and severe NPC-syndrome milquetoast takes like you see from r/news.

This type of stuff happens constantly, as the people were saying yesterday, in their small niche communities. It's like a plague that you just don't want happening to your sane space but it inevitably does.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Indeed. I understand that they offer some services that aren't just an API call and make sense to go through them directly. 

But from a cost standpoint isn't that literally what the API pricing is for? Essentially pay a sort-of wholesale price based on the amount of compute required by a given model.

If someone is doing so many queries they're going beyond $200/month then just charge them by the token. For really big users they can sign Enterprise contracts with more favorable pricing if necessary.

All of this seems like pretty basic SaaS stuff.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/TommyShelbyPFB:

---

&gt;*By the end of 2023, NASA had a newly appointed Director of UAP Research and a raft of recommendations from the independent UAP Study Team it had commissioned to advise NASA on how to use its assets to study UAP.*

&gt;*What outcomes did this wealth of UAP assets produce in 2024? So far as we know, very little of consequence*

&gt;***According to Mike Gold, the position was vacated a year later and remains vacant.***

&gt;*As a member of the UAP Study Team, he helped author the following set of recommendations that were included in the final report:* ***NASA should actively seek more comprehensive UAP data; crowdsource UAP data from contemporary sightings via a cell phone app or other means; improve FAA reporting by making it truly anonymous; calibrate NASA satellites, telescopes and sensors to study UAP; do data processing and data mining for UAP evidence in NASA’s archives; create an analytic framework that defines the background “haystack” in order to find the anomalous “needle” of UAP.***

&gt;*I asked Gold if he was aware of any progress on any of those objectives that's been made in the year since the report was released. He replied,* ***“Relative to the recommendations being implemented, I haven't seen that yet.”***

NASA announced this big UFO study as a show of transparency to the public. [Refused to look at any classified data](https://youtu.be/IGo-zQssvhc?t=3240). Refused to release any meaningful data from their archives. Refused to implement any of the recommendations from their own study. And then quietly reassigned the people involved.

Yeah this really helped with the transparency guys.
