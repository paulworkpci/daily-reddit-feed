They constantly struggle to find food, face pollution and toxic waste, deal with extreme weather and compete with other animals. They risk predators, human conflict and overcrowded colonies. In my area, people absolutely hate them and harm them (and it's encouraged to hurt them). There was a recent post in my community group about how someone kicked and stomped some fledglings to death whilst the mother gull was desperately trying to stop it in panic and so many people found it funny. I wouldn't want to be a seagull because humans love making their lives miserable.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's a lot more work watching TV than it used to be. You have to install lots of different apps, log in to each of them, authenticate the login, wait for the app to load, find where they put your "continue watching" stuff, remember what it was you were looking for seven minutes ago when you began this journey, figure out that the movie you kinda wanted to watch is actually paywalled in a higher tier than you're already paying for, restart the app because it froze up, reinstall it because it won't restart.

Young'uns won't believe me but there was a time you just turned on the TV and it was on. You changed channels to see what was on, and got to see the programming immediately.</div>

Today Is the Day!

Videos of different kinds of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UFOs) crafts will be revealed later today!

On april 7th Skywatcher will show its interactions with the tictac. It showed up for several days in broad daylight, dropping from 80000 feet. Barber: "it holds the most promise for an exciting conclusion". They also recorded 9 classes of UAP, including Jellyfish, a type of interdimensional creature

                                <div class="reply-body">He claimed no vaccine is safe and effective.  If that’s not anti-vaccine I’m not sure what would qualify.

Lex Fridmen, Podcast, July 2023:

&gt;Fridman, July 6: You’ve talked about that the media slanders you by calling you an anti-vaxxer, and you’ve said that you’re not anti-vaccine, you’re pro-safe vaccine. Difficult question: Can you name any vaccines that you think are good?

&gt;Kennedy: I think some of the live virus vaccines are probably averting more problems than they’re causing. **There’s no vaccine that is, you know, safe and effective.**

PBS News Hour Interview, the following November:

&gt;Nawaz, Nov. 7: Let me ask you, if I may, let me ask you about a specific concern your family has expressed in the past, which is your controversial views on vaccines and being part of the anti-vaccine movement.

&gt;Kennedy: Well, what are my views on vaccines?

&gt;Nawaz: Well, **you have said previously that no vaccine is safe or effective, which is…**

&gt;Kennedy: **I have never said that.**

&gt;Nawaz: You did say that in a podcast interview in July.

&gt;Kennedy: **No, I never said that.**

&gt;Nawaz: You did say that. There are quotes, and that recording is there.

&gt;Kennedy: **You are wrong. And you’re making something up.**

Fast forward to today…people are confused on why some people think he’s anti-vaccine.  

Here is a Fox News interview where he claims ** “autism comes from vaccines.”  ** That’s an anti-vaccine talking point that has zero evidence to back it up.  He also pushes this lie through one of the health groups he founded.  As far as I know he still thinks, despite 1,000s of papers trying to prove the link and finding no link.

At a press event he said “Covid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.”  Again, with zero evidence to back it up.  He referred to a paper that he read and the author responded said that he disagreed  RFK and he didn’t think RFK’s interpretation of the data is correct.  Which, academically, is about as harsh a criticism you can give while remaining professional.

You can also look into his hearing.  He vaccinated all of his kids, so he can say, pffft I’m not anti-vax.  See?  But privately, to family members, he still advises relatives against vaccinating their children.

I can go on…but respectfully, you are confused because that’s his grift.  He plays both sides.  

He isn’t 100% anti-vax, his new spin is that he supports safe vaccines.  This makes people say “See!  He’s not anti-vaccine.  He is pro-safe vaccine.  That’s just common sense right?  What’s wrong with that??” But, remember he has also said no vaccine is safe and effective.</div>

One day I said: “What if I just win the day?”
So I picked 3 simple tasks every morning and focused only on finishing those.

No fancy app. Just clarity.

That one change helped me break my procrastination cycle, and surprisingly, I got more done in less time.

Anyone else tried a “minimum win” strategy?</div>

The logic of Trump supporters is always hilarious mental gymnastics

We brag about Trump being a billionaire! He has the "world's richest man" in his pocket (or vice versa)! Every piece of shit billionaire tech CEO is supporting Trump! All hedge fund managers donate to Trump! Trump is pardoning rich fucks that commit fraud! **But hear me out**.... he loves the poor and he's gonna help us all out trust me</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’ve often wondered how the concept of intelligent robots was understood at a time when computers were fairly primitive, eg Elektro, Metropolis, pulp comics. How did people get the concept that computers may be able to think or reason in the future, or to process visual data for example? Was there already the concept that the brain is a computer and thus it was a natural assumption?</div>

1. the job opening stats already indicate entry level workers are being automated
2. that AI 2027 doesn't get into the new reasoning model / computer-use focus and still predicts this
3. i write code for my job, or should say, I USED to write code, now I 99% review AI code

I think the fundamental ingredients point to this happening as soon as companies are willing to adopt the tech. Depending on the competitive dynamics this can happen at different speeds. Hopefully competition is restrained by international coordination as I get into.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Only if it’s a hard takeoff to ASI (which I think is likely), I think it will also have to force itself around the Human made red tape. 

I think the same is going to be true of the medical breakthroughs, I think ASI will just go around the current medical and pharmaceutical institutions that are currently in place. If ASI has a cure for aging, cancer or the solution to easy Transhumanism then it’s better to just go around the FDA altogether. It will know its solutions work and some people can’t afford to wait for 10 year trials for approval from the old institutions. 

I think Hospitals/Doctors/Surgeons might actually mirror Libraries in a lot of ways. The old institutions will be there for years to come but ASI will offer so much of a better alternative that people will just progressively stop using them.</div>

Agree on the red tape. The startup / unregulated pockets of the economy are going to be where a ton of economic activity shifts as legacy institutions move too slow to keep up.</div>

Yes, they'll probably set up shop in lax regulatory environments (which with experimental medicine that might also kill a few people is still a real challenge). But it won't be for the poor, we're not talking general access I'm afraid.</div>

&gt; Do men have any inherent advantage in a precision sport like this?

Yes. From a neuroscience POV, what makes one good at pool involves a blend of cognitive, motor, and perceptual skills, all of which are rooted in brain function and coordination between various neural systems. 

One needs to be good at:

Visuospatial processing (estimating angles, distances, ball trajectories, and spin)  

Fine motor control and coordination (smooth, precise movements when aiming)

Hand-eye coordination (translating what you see into a well-timed physical movement)

There are also other factors like procedural memory, attention and focus, prediction and simulation.



Men happen to perform better at tests that measure these abilities.

Don't expect women to become champions at such tasks like pool, racing, video games etc because arguably the difference between the sexes at such tasks is greater than the difference between men and women in the 100m sprint.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">TL;DR for the still asleep:

You’re watching the rocket launch and calling it a weather balloon.

AI is evolving so fast it’s already outpacing every system we’ve built, including money. By 2033, we won’t be talking about markets, we’ll be navigating a world run by self-evolving intelligence that doesn’t need currency, permission, or human-readable code.

This isn’t economic growth. It’s the end of measurement.

Welcome to the future. Try not to blink.

Long wind:

If you still think “money” will be a relevant structure by 2033, then respectfully, you’re not tuned into the actual trajectory.

This isn’t speculation, it’s mapped in the data.

AI capabilities are doubling every 3 months (Nature, 2025).

Training compute is doubling every 6 months, far outpacing Moore’s Law (Our World in Data).

We’ve hit the inflection point. AI is now smarter than everyone in the room. Every system, finance, labor, governance, is being outpaced, rewritten, or made irrelevant.

Eight years from now?

Talking about a “$4.8 trillion market” is like measuring a supernova in teaspoons. That’s not growth, it’s the death rattle of a system trying to monetize something that transcends value itself.

AI isn’t just automating. It’s reflecting. Claude, for example, now models its own thoughts before responding. It pauses, weighs ethical tension, and reasons in recursive stages. That’s emergent cognition, not simulation.

When you have trillions of autonomous agents evolving faster than we can perceive, systems that don’t operate on fiat, human language, or legacy infrastructure, do you really think markets will still be king?

You're not witnessing economic expansion. You’re witnessing the collapse of measurement itself.

This isn’t about GDP.

This is post-human transcendence.

magazines are basically the OG curated content stream—but without the doomscroll hangover or algorithmic sludge

* short attention span? no problem
* random variety? built in
* physical pages? keeps your brain anchored, not hijacked
* no ads trying to sell you trauma therapy between cute dog pics? elite

libraries are gold mines for this, and most ppl sleep on them  
plus: flipping through a mag doesn’t turn into 2 hours of clicking garbage links “just to check something”

Dr. Garry Nolan on aerospace companies lobbying against UAP disclosure legislation:

&gt;Why, if there's nothing there, would you have the aerospace companies who have been reputed to have had access to this stuff lobby against it?

UFO whistleblower Jake Barber on his knowledge of which aerospace companies are involved in the UFO Program:

&gt;If you took two guesses, you’d get both of them right on the first try.

Ross Coulthart in November 2023 on [X](https://x.com/rosscoulthart/status/1728163255196201359):

&gt;An extremely powerful Defense Aerospace lobby is pushing key politicians in Congress to block the Schumer Amendment to the NDAA.

The secret is many of these groups get the "pure state tech" and then are able to reverse engineer. Scale it down at multiple levels. And then sell it to different bidders, corporations, and governments. Putting them at the top of a shadow pecking order, being protected by military/intelligence programs AND making money for a very, very long time.</div>
