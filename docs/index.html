The main reason I can't stand to listen is all the covid rants and insane out of touch stuff about wokeness censoring everyone, even though that basically crash and burned years ago. Personally, I think he needs to get back to having more diverse guests on the show - both for the country's good and for his own mental health. Stop living in 2020 and worrying about covid or wokeness or someone trying to get us to stop saying the word "homeless." We need to move on.

He has had on **Rand Paul** and **Kash Patel.** How about Gavin Newsom and Tim Walz, or even Kirk Watson - the Austin mayor. Let's get some scientists on. David Sinclair loves to talk about his research of longevity. Bring on a mushroom researcher that's not Paul Stamets, and some exoplanet experts. Get some AI people on. Bring on some space company people that aren't just Elon Musk - the space industry is absolutely booming right now. There are so many huge and fascinating issues happening in the world, and yeah, many of the MMA and conservative comedy fans will tune out, but who cares? Joe has his $300 million and can have on anyone he wants, and exposing people to new ideas would be awesome.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The truth is Joe agrees with most of what we all believe until it comes to Trans rights and some group think stuff that is questionable. Literally. That's actually the entire jist of his break off from a more liberal viewpoint. I bet it actually does kill him that immigrants are being persecuted, that rights of many others are being trampled on. Joe is not a racist but he along with many of his generation can't let go of some specific bigoted ideas. 

I'd venture to say, 80% of what Conservatives actually stand for Joe probably hates and hates the fact he's lumped with this poison that's basically destroying the country. Trans rights and group think when it comes to vaccines broke him completely but now he's dealing with some pretty severe cognitive dissonance</div>

The fact of the matter is that if you were 15 at the beginning of Covid, you’re about to graduate from college. So much of the world has moved on.</div>

Antimatter is worth trying for coding this. Sounds like a fairly simple bot for an AI to build. Probably could get it made in a few hours.

Be sure to get AI to make a full planning document in markdown before it starts coding (and ask other AIs for second opinions or improvements on on the document), so that the agent can build the whole thing following it step by step. Usually better results this way.</div>

I've said it before but if you took a caveman baby from 100k years ago and brought it to our time you could teach it to read and write and drive a car and work in a factory etc. with &gt;10000x less data than a VLM has been trained on.</div>

How long would that take. How long to turn Barry the truck driver it a tenured maths professor? How much "data" would that take.

All the while your focusing on Barry or the child's learning rate IGNORING the centuries of education system that we had to advance through, the millions of lives it took to "create" advance maths.

Teachers don't grow on trees. Or in a vacuum.

Humanity is one interconnected neural net.

Put yourself on a desert island. Tell me how long it takes you to learn something there, with no references or instructors or books.... Or reference memories of the previous world you came from.

From before birth you are absorbing everything, from all your biological senses and trillions of signal releasing cells, every day for years.

From the trillions of years of cross pollinated human experience.

Some children take 4-5 years before they can walk.

Some people will never learn to swim, read a book or drive a car or fly a plane.

Sports/combat is still considered a controlled setting (a ring, a court, a field) with strict rules and so on...and plenty of footage for AI to train on.

Art also works because we have so much data and it is still considered a controlled environment (a page/canvas/frame).

Household chores is the wild west. Their current approach is to sell you the robot so you can train it on your specific house requirements...Beta testing, basically.</div>

If the task is repeatable and highly controlled, it is most likely already automated and done by a non-humanoid robot.

The types of tasks that would benefit from humanoid robot specifically are the types of things that require a mix of abilities that humans possess. This normally involves dealing with varied and unpredictable environments and objects. Often it means a combination of strength and dexterity. Dealing with objects that respond in complicated ways like fabrics, or objects which are difficult to grasp and manipulate like wet objects, or soft objects.

We keep seeing the things you mention not because of a weird focus on those but because they are all way easier.</div>

The models and agents can be stretched in various creative ways in order to be better. We see this recently with Cursor able to get many GPT-5.2 agents to build a browser within a week. And now with Anthropic utilizing multi-turn conversations to squeeze out gains. The methodology is different from METR of having the agent run once.

function of task length. Extrapolating using the linear fit, Claude.ai would
hit a 50% success rate at about 19 hours. This may reflect how multi-turn

Lexus released the Configurator for the new IS generation, which removes all of the trim levels except for the IS350 levels.

They left the 2025 configurator still open to compare to, and I noticed that the 0-60 times had shifted a noticeable amount.

The AWD versions are now quoted at 6 seconds, instead of 5.7 seconds of the previous gen.

The RWD versions are now quoted at 5.9 seconds instead of 5.6 seconds for the previous generation.

Considering this car has been changed very little for like 20 years, it is odd that their own quoted 0-60 times would go down. Particularly since tires just get better.</div>

That said, performance is a weak point and don't go in expecting an athletic sports car. Gas mileage is also not good. I went with a M240i, which I think makes more sense in that price range.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Can confirm, I didn't buy my IS350 primarily for speed. [It can do 0 - 60 in 5.5](https://youtu.be/fr6Xij8TsxQ?si=RHeN_EE275bN7Tbo&amp;t=16m15s) so only 3 tenths slower than a 330i, which is what it competes against. 


My car, in the real world, is plenty fast for street driving. You don't **need** anything more when you're just passing people, or making it to the next traffic light, or something other than pretending the streets are the Nurburgring.


If I truly cared about speed, I would have bought the '24 M340i xDrive, which was still within budget at the time for an extra $9k. I still went with the Lexus because shaving 1s or more off the 0 - 60 isn't relevant when my priority is to have a reliable daily driver that has the feature set that I want.


This sub is full of people who think 0 - 60 is the only thing that matters, it isn't like that in the real world, nobody is out here on the streets dropping 0 - 60 times on their way to work.


To put it another way, it's like saying X dollars (a few years ago, not at today's prices lol) can get you a Mustang GT, why would you ever spend that much on a top trim Mazda MX5? It's slower, smaller, only has 4 cylinders, and has fewer seats. </div>

The transmission in the Lexus is also fairly old and tuned more for fuel economy (taller gears). Even the IS500 which makes more power than the m340 is notably slower and I'm guessing the transmission is holding it back a lot.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I yearn for the gilded age JRE where Joe wasnt famous enough to have people get star struck by him, when he guided conversations with actual cool guests rather than dominating a conversation…

I miss most of all the feeling of surprise and wonder that I would get with a guest who had some seriously weird stories or esoteric knowledge. The hours of being pulled away from the drudgery of everyday life.

Now it seems everyone knows exactly what they’re going to get with an episode of JRE.

That’s when I stopped because I didn’t care enough to jump platforms, which I’m sure was exactly the point of signing him for exclusivity. Having decided not to bother, I remember one of the vegan nutrition “debate” shows where he asked YJ to look up some bullshit stat, then modified the search term maybe 5 times until he was able to find the exact half-snippet of an un-replicated study that would back up the total bullshit statement he’d just made. He then declared victory and moved on as though anything he’d just said fell outside of obvious confirmation bias. Right around there I think I said out loud to myself “yeah, I’m not going to miss this dude.”           
Nowadays I mostly hear him via the Know Rogan podcast.</div>

Office workers hire tradespeople.
If AI cuts office pay and jobs, people stop spending AND some office workers move into the trades.

Less demand + more workers = lower wages.
Then robots come for parts of blue collar work too.</div>

this is important because you might be labeled as a part time student, losing you access to scholarship, financial aid and more.

                        <div class="comment-body">At this point I'm thoroughly interested in when scientists will try to dig into skillful enjoyment of music where people take advantage of the bouncy quality of emotions and stillness in order to bounce them around from the middle, so to say. I think if it would at least get people more excited about it that'd be great cuz that's a skill I really would have wanted when I was younger. Now that I'm more practiced I enjoy having the option to use faster rhythms in order to get my body into a different balance in order to move energy in suitable ways. This is something that wasn't around a thousand years ago too so it's not something people tend to talk about, however if the rhythms are balanced off each other it basically puts some extra energy into places where energy merge in the body and it can involve a lot of what I would deem subperceptual shifts of energy, it can get tight in the body and depending on the dude doing it that would involve various factors. Like for me it could be fun as hell but for someone else who doesn't have much skill with stillness in the first place they would be stuck cuz they dunno how to do it and it'll just get all rushy. 

It's like the basic flow up the spine is really well kept but people could wonder what the rest entails cuz the body can get extra engaged merging energy from place to place more and THEN get stuck, so it feels like the body can't quite maintain the rhythms, there are little pauses at some levels where it can hit something harder. Even still, you'd think it'd be more popular but it's like a lot of people wouldn't know what to think of it.

I would so sign up for an MRI study if it were in my general area. That sounds fun. It's frustrating, have you ever seen scientific research on Kundalini that's got to do with spinal fluid? I think it's pretty annoying that people can have the taste of it and stuff and have the bumps on top of their head but there's not more literal documentation? I'm talking about when amrita, which I think is spinal fluid, I mean when it drains from the brain into mucous membranes, it happens when there is much more fluid in the brain than normal. That is what people think but where's the big showcase here? Why not more research on piezoelectric crystals? U know, I know for sure people could literally just not take studies cuz they think they're fake or not scientific enough, but there has to be more than what I've seen

Like, I get it I guess, there's gotta be something. Back before AI there were studies about pot while driving, for instance, but it was impossible to find the studies finding little to no difference in some circumstances. I just heard from a friend, somehow she knew. I get it but by now I would've thought I'd see more depth in some of these topics.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's not really equivalent tbh. Think of every previous massive tech upgrade and think about their scope. AI is orders of magnitude greater. 

The aim isn't to replace an activity or a simple mechanism but it is to try and emulate and exceed the general capabilities of human intelligence. That's a big fuckin deal. 

If we have technology that makes thinking obsolete then that's not going to just lead to a job pivot. We will have to rethink the entire structure of government and the economy and western life. How much of someone's identity and meaning comes from vocation? How much of human identity is based around our capability in regards to other lifeforms? 

Like yeah, current AI is just a bit shit for a few people's jobs but there is potential for it to completely change almost every person's life. 

There will be a new wave of extreme Luddites for sure and im not totally against it.</div>

Every time I ask one of the people who says 'it's just like replacing a horse' what new jobs will be created because of AI? they go silent. 


We won't need mechanics. We won't need writers 
We won't need graphic designers. We won't need manual labor. We won't need coders. We won't need sales people. AI can do it all better, faster, cheaper. 


They miss the point... we won't need people to do anything when robots can do everything people do. </div>

I mean, in a sane world, there'd be some sort of non-profit governor to verify that the company is working as a non-profit and performing some sort of public good. 

But clearly that did not happen with OpenAI. They didn't release their first open model until a long long time after this decision was made.</div>
