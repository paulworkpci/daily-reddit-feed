                        <div class="comment-body">SS: The incoming administration will make the case that a reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment will allow the administration to exclude two categories of infants from the right to U.S. citizenship: Infants born to a mother who is unlawfully in the country and a father who is not a citizen or permanent resident, and infants born to a mother who is authorized to be in the country for a temporary period of time and a father who is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.

The administration could bar the Social Security Administration from issuing Social Security numbers and cards to these babies. Parents typically request these documents upon their babies’ birth at the hospital, along with the application for a birth certificate, which is issued by the state where the birth happened. Without U.S. citizenship, these babies would not qualify for passports, leaving them without access to another form of identification and also unable to travel.</div>

I’m not one for productivity “hacks,” or apps. So I was surprised when the default daily “Reading Goal” displayed on my phone’s Books app (iPhone) motivated me to read more every day. I didn’t set this up intentionally - I just wanted quick access to a parenting book I was referring to as a new Dad so I set the widget up.

5 minutes isn’t a lot, but it’s enough to get started. ...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">1. The on-screen streak motivation helps.  
2. Find titles you’re interested in.  
3. At some point, you just have to do it. Scrolling is habitual, almost like “muscle memory.” You have to be mindful enough to stop yourself in the moment and do something different. 
4. Start small. 5 minutes of scrolling is nothing, right? 5 minutes of reading is the same length of time.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is Dario’s specific definition of “powerful AI” taken from [the essay he mentions](https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace) in this interview:

* Superhuman Intelligence: It is smarter than a Nobel Prize winner across most relevant fields like biology, programming, math, engineering, and writing. This implies it can solve complex problems in these fields, prove unsolved theorems, create novels, and write difficult code.

* Human-like Interfaces: It has access to typical human interfaces like text, audio, video, mouse, keyboard, and internet access, allowing interaction with digital systems and remote operations.

* Autonomous Task Completion: It can be given tasks that take hours, days, or weeks and can complete them autonomously, requesting clarification when needed, like a smart employee.

* Control of Physical Tools: Although it doesn’t have a physical embodiment, it can control physical tools, robots, and lab equipment through computers and can even design its own tools.

* Multiple Copies: The trained model can be replicated millions of times, matching projected cluster sizes, and each copy can act independently or collaboratively.

* Faster than Human Speed: The model can absorb information and generate actions at roughly 10x-100x the speed of humans.

Also wanted to add the specific quote about the cluster size thing:

&gt; The resources used to train the model can be repurposed to run millions of instances of it (this matches projected cluster sizes by ~2027), and the model can absorb information and generate actions at roughly 10x-100x human speed.

Dario Amodei is essentially saying *millions* of ASI instances could very well be running in massive data centers by 2027</div>

I really like his writing style honestly it's a big breather from most CEO publications. He's always been way more frank with his opinions and it shows here.</div>

horrible take. 

there is still time for you to delete this.

how is it conceivably possible that you did not factor the possibility that Sam and co. is constantly in meetings with researchers/engineers where they give progress and forecast updates, and he is only relaying their opinions.

how could you have such a lapse in reasoning?

is your need to suck Dario dick so great that you feel the need to shit on others?

1 datapoint is an opinion, 2 data points is an observation, 3 or more is almost certainty.

if all the big labs are saying the same thing why would you conclude that 1 guy knows what he's talking about and the others don't WHEN THEY'RE ALL SAYING 1+1 = 2? 🤦‍♀️</div>

I don't disagree with your overall viewpoint on things and the sentiment, but if you're the president and you're trying to create an efficient surveillance state, you *definitely* want model testing results before the model release, and the power to enforce some action, steal the model, pull the model, or at least, something...

                        <div class="comment-body">It's not officially considered an addiction due to how we define addiction in the DSM. It's not really a conspiracy. It's just that things like the internet and phone addiction are not the same as drug addictions. They lack an exogenous substance that is directly altering brain chemistry to produce dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal.

When someone loses access to their phone or internet, they generally feel better within a few seconds or hours. Sometimes a day or two. Anything longer is usually due to underlying issues they were masking but could be struggling to get themselves into a new routine without their phones. I think we just need a different categorization for it in the DSM. Likely, it'll be similar to gambling addiction once it is better characterized and definable.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Feeling better in seconds or hours is not what I see from the people I'm interacting with. Nor a day. It usually takes weeks to shake the impulse and even then, you still have to work out how you can interact with phones since most people cannot function in society without it.

I understand it's not categorized in DSM (neither is porn addiction, but it is recognized). I also understand there's nuance when compared to substance addiction. I don't want to belittle anyone who is dealing with something at that level. 

The biggest issue, I think, is we don't acknowledge that the average time spent on phones (5 hours a day!) is in part to compulsion. 

I see in your other comment that 10-12 hours a day is problematic, but would you say 5 is acceptable? 

I don't think society will accept that it's addictive impulses that bring us back to doom scrolling or other unhealthy phone practices.</div>

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday revoked a 2023 executive order signed by Joe Biden that sought to reduce the risks that artificial intelligence poses to consumers, workers and national security.

Biden's order required developers of AI systems that pose risks to U.S. national security, the economy, public health or safety to share the resu...</div>

GPT-4 and Gemini Ultra, both above 10\^25 FLOPS, just missed this cutoff.

In my opinion, this was the most meaningful US decision to date regarding AI safety in the right direction, and to revoke it is a critical mistake.</div>

But it will still pave way for AI to quickly design drugs. Hopefully others could mimic it and open patents to the  alternatives of the closed patented drugs</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Testing new drugs is extremely expensive. Clinical trials are extremely expensive and involve a lot of moving parts. I don't think you actually want the people who have the most powerful drug discovery tools in existence right now (Google's AI tools) to announce that the patents will be free for all to use, because it would mean no pharmaceutical companies would be interested in paying for the trials to happen.

There is no way around this. A company funding a trial is taking a financial risk -- they don't know if the drug will work out (hence the trial), but they're spending money on it anyways. No rational actor will do that without potential reward.</div>

&gt; Egg shaped UAP and “Pod” in Antartica photos

It’s me again. As I promised, a few hours ago, here are some of the photos of the Antarctica retrieval mission, in Queen Elizabeth’s Range.

- Photo 1- Egg UAP.       
- Photo 2- Egg UAP (another angle).       
- Photo 3-“Hieroglyphs” on the cave’s wall.       
- Photo 4-“Pod” where the entity was sleeping.      
- Photo 5-“Pod” where the entity was sleeping (another angle)

Sorry for the delay.

                        <div class="comment-body">I'll just leave this quote from Carl Sagan's "The Demon Haunted World", published in 1996:

"I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness."</div>

"If we've been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We're no longer interested in finding the truth. The Bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we've been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back."

                        <div class="comment-body">Like I didn’t fuck around and yet I’m still going to have to find out.

ETA: I’m talking about individually right now, not speaking as a collective for all Americans. Ya know, just trying to answer the question of how I feel. Some of the responses seem to think I’m talking about us as a whole. Idk how, since that’s not the question that was asked.

Edit 2: guys when I say “I didn’t fuck around” I mean I didn’t vote for this and actively voted, petitioned, phone banked, protested, begged, debated against this. That’s what I meant and a lot of people aren’t getting that. And all of the people I’ve worked with are going to be affected by this as well, so even though we did try we’re still going to have to “find out”. Yes, some people just showed up and voted. I wasn’t one of them, I’ve been doing this work for over 10 years, longer than I’ve even been legally able to vote (2016 election) and it FAILED. Idk how to explain to people that I’m not “shifting blame”, I’m frustrated bc I actually did try and get involved and do all of the things they say to do and it didn’t matter for the results of 2026 or 2024 bc of bullshit. Im exhausted and probably turning comment notifications off, hopefully I’ll see you guys out and protesting since so many other counties are also leaning so hard to the right. Catch it now, or you’ll be a fascist too.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Seriously. Like, why did I bother putting in all of that time to understand what it will mean for everybody if Trump gets elected if not enough people do? I see all of these people who are like "I didn't know he was going to do that!" and wonder "well, why not?! He only said that he was going to do that for the past ten years! And some of those things he said that he was going to do he did during the first four years!"

Now my loved ones and I are going to suffer because not enough people bothered looking into the idiot they voted for or didn't vote against.

**Edit after the interview:** He gives his definition of AGI, which is a "country of geniuses inside datacenters". So yes it's a strong definition of AGI (I'd consider it ASI) and is consistent with his previous definitions, which were more about heavy AI R&amp;D automation.</div>

ASI imho would be “Singularity” status. There is an even bigger gap between the two to the difference between AGI and human intelligence. You could argue in 2-3 years it is collective intelligence much higher than a single human but it would still be within a form of AGI like humans general intelligence just without restraints eg speed, scale etc.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Not what he is saying. Humans are pretty dumb, AGI only needs to be smarter than most people and it's surpassed 'us'.


When AGI is smarter than 99% of humans in every field it's basically Einstein smart but about every topic it's still AGI. We'll not really be better off physics, math or logic wise. We should be able to offload a lot of boring jobs, like almost all of them, and start doing what we want to instead though. 


That's the dream right?



ASI is nothing we can imagine, intelligence beyond anything we can currently concieve of. Literally able to solve every problem.</div>

If ASI is just smarter than humans, how would we call the result or its iterated self-improvement? super-ASI?  
It seems wiser to keep the term to refer to the result of advanced self-improvement, something that kind of solves intelligence, unfathomable intelligence.</div>

Eventually did a half-marathon, still hating it. I trained so much and was promised I’d get addicted to it. Nope. Never happened. Never ran again. 

I think the trick is to keep trying different things until something clicks. So rock climbing and hula dancing keep me active but running will never be my friend.</div>

Some people like running (I hate it). Some people like swimming (I hate it). Some people like going to a gym (I hate it).

But I love kettlebell workouts at home and I like walking/hiking/rucking. Those things I enjoy, can do them regularly and that’s what keeps me in a good shape.

                        <div class="comment-body">Yeah. The other issue with FB is if/when your account gets jacked and people use it for fraud. They do a great job of making a super fun and shiny site (sort of, I think they likely fired their whole design team in 2019), but then will tell you to piss off if you have a security issue. Actually, no, they don’t even do that. You can’t get hold of someone for real help and their automated systems suck. I’m not sure why anyone uses that crap anymore.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">After the release from DeepSeek yesterday, I have no idea how anyone is still surprised by this. They literally scaled to near benchmark saturation solely with RL fine-tuning.

&gt; During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performanceon reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performanceof OpenAI-o1-0912.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It takes more than intelligence to create useful agents. It is great that these models will get smarter and cheaper, but unless their output (whether clicks or plans or information) is 99.99% reliable we will spend a lot of time watching them and checking their work for mistakes. They will not be useful.

This is like self-driving cars. Cars have been able to drive themselves pretty well for years but that last 1% is what prevents them being ubiquitous. I expect the same may be true of agents.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think self driving is much more complicated, it requires real time reaction with an insane amount of dynamic real time physical parameters and extremely unique edge cases.

If the models keep improving their reasoning (which they are), and keep training on how to use software, I think we will get there pretty soon. They are afforded the time to think through things, reflect on their actions, and check their own work unlike self driving. They can also produce full reports on their actions and ask questions to humans when necessary, unlike self driving really. 

On the evaluations of operator posted yesterday, it sounded like it already outperformed humans on the webvoyager benchmark which is common research/web tasks it sounds like. Just a benchmark, but that’s impressive if true.

Not downplaying that it will be challenging, but I think it will be a lot easier than self driving, and I could see a world in which it comes sooner than we think. Maybe not though, we’ll see</div>

the conclusion in short: 

&gt;I see many of the improvements made by DeepSeek as “obvious in retrospect”: they are the kind of innovations that, had someone asked me in advance about them, I would have said were good ideas. However, as I’ve said earlier, this doesn’t mean it’s easy to come up with the ideas in the first place.

&gt;I’ve heard many people express the sentiment that the DeepSeek team has “good taste” in research. Based just on these architectural improvements I think that assessment is right. None of these improvements seem like they were found as a result of some brute-force search through possible ideas. Instead, they look like they were carefully devised by researchers who understood how a Transformer works and how its various architectural deficiencies can be addressed.

Personally I'd add to this that "distillation" has even before deepseek been highly impressive in how good the results have been, so this was not *that* surprising to me</div>

No offense to the DeepSeek team—these models are still good—but their claims would be more concrete if they provided the benchmark settings, allowing others to replicate them.</div>

I imagine you would get it to classify a number of other images that weren't Nazi salutes if you took them at the right point in the motion but this was a very deliberate motion.</div>

I think we get too hung up on Nazi, which was a specific political movement.
