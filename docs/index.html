Imagine spending 10 billions just to notice a bug made your model useless, which basically means bankruptcy. Also, scaling laws give a very good sense of how much compute to use given model size and training data constraints. Given this it just isn't worth it to spend more on compute and instead focus on experiments to prepare for the next model generation.</div>

I'm not sure I've ever heard or read anyone serious saying that AI Is done developing, has gone flat, or has plateaued.  

That said, I think it is plausible that AI growth has gone from exponential to linear. Eventually it would be reasonable to even expect the growth to become incremental.</div>

People view these as fun little competitions, but each one it knocks out is just one step closer to becoming good enough to where it beats all future competitions.

There is a take off point where it starts creating its own discoveries. Who knows when that point will be reached, but I would hazard a guess it's just down the road.</div>

"Difficulty Distribution. We classify problem difficulty using human performance data. Based on median student scores, we define four levels: Easy (median above 50%), Medium (median between 30% and 50%), Hard (median between 10% and 30%), and Extra Hard (median below 10%). The resulting distribution in our dataset spans all difficulty levels, with 21% Easy, 25% Medium, 35% Hard, and 19% Extra Hard problems, taking into account both theory and data analysis exams. This balance ensures that our evaluation captures both straightforward questions and the most challenging ones."</div>

And I realized something as soon as I heard a specific quote from it. I realized that I think the entire way were thinking about AI's effect on the internet, is wrong. It was a warning about what AI will do to social media. "Stuff just good enough, will soak up the majority of human attention. It could make us dumber, less informed, our attention spans even worse, increase political divides, and make us negl...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yup, well said. A feed of AI-generated Sora videos or a feed of human-created TikTok videos both aim to just hook you on a steady supply of dopamine; neither will help you accomplish a goal, better yourself, or build genuine human connection.

Nobody is legally required to be on social media. And even among social media, there are much less addictive alternatives like Mastodon (which is precisely the reason they're a fraction of the size), or you can just read blogs on an RSS reader. 

AI is a very powerful technology, so it can make bad things worse. But we can also use it to make good things better.</div>

this is a very false equivalence. makes you feel like they are both equal. 

It can make good things better by 100x but bad things worse by 1000x.

If you disagree, this line is what people said about social media. has the good and bad of facebook been equal?</div>

We may succeed at taking some platforms down through that process but many more would flood in to take their place.


In my view the much deeper issue is how our brains work and more importantly, how easily they can be hacked and our thought processes disrupted. YouTube shorts for example are likely a kind of junk food which is actively harming us.


We need stronger education around critical thinking and mental health, otherwise we'll continue to be harmed. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That would help quite a bit, but I don't think it's enough. This feels to much like patching the symptoms instead of the illness. And while yes this would have good outcomes short term, long term social media companies will adapt and find more clever ways to get past our defenses. The human mind is a fundamentally hackable system, and they will find more exploits. There's only so much we can change about our brains, but we can change our systems however we want. So we need a solution that treat the illness at the core, and instead of adapting to a flawed system, adapt the system to our flawed minds.

Now I'm not sure how we could do this honestly. The companies are huge, and the communication required to create a social media platform with ethical algorithms, would have to be done on platforms with unethical ones. BlueSky proves that this is possible though, and that people are attempting to build algorithms that are designed for people, not just people shaped bots.</div>

Like okay, when later? After lunch? After scrolling for 2 hours? After I die??

Every time I ask myself that, I realize there’s never an actual “later.” It’s just my brain’s way of saying “I don’t wanna.” So now I just do one tiny version of the thing right away. Like if I need to clean my room, I’ll just pick up one shirt. That’s it. And somehow, it breaks the spell.

When the internet rolled out, no one had the tech at home ti yse it, cables had to be put underground and stuff to make it available.
Now, you dont even need to download anything to use AI because it's just part of every software update with every single program you are using.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">As a caution to people here, Hinton's definition of subjective experience is VERY different from more common ones.

He believes that subjective experience is simply a form of error correction. When there is a mismatch in data, that is what is 'subjective'. So if you feel hot but the thermometer says it is cold, that is you having a subjective experience of heat, rather than a real one.

Computers can have this sort of data mismatch. In lectures he uses an example of an ai with their camera pointed at a mirror such that it cannot tell. It creates a subjective experience if you explain that it is looking at a mirror and what it was seeing previously was 90degrees off of reality due to the reflection.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I cant fully agree to this, as it depends on what is getting censored. If someone chats about the fantasy how to abuse a child, i think its importan that ChatGPT blocks that, because in such scene chatgpt would fuel the person to abuse a child, if it wouldnt block it. Thats why its so important to adjust the settings on it very well.

The goal shouldn’t be “erase the topic,” but “detect the intent.”</div>

Once, a client told me my report was too basic and a waste of time. It stung because I had spent days on it. 

My first impulse was to defend myself, but I stopped and asked, what is useful here? I realized he actually wanted deeper insights, not just metrics.   
  
So, I rewrote the next report focusing on results and trends. He appreciated it, the tension disappeared, and our working relationship improved.

It should not always be received as an insult, and OP has very maturely reacted professionally to unprofessional feedback (unprofessionalisim: the mixing of one’s personal feelings with work). 

Constructive feedback has a general formula. This is what was bad about your work, these are the reasons it was bad, and finally this is what we would like to be corrected for next time. 

If you miss these points you’re really only communication how shit you think the other persons work is and that what takes you over the line from professionalism to unprofessionalism. 

Good on you OP for keeping your cool. I wish I could manage all of my poor and unprofessional feedback as you have. </div>

The metric is simple: if a task takes a human expert 30 minutes, can the AI do it on its own with 50% reliability? This directly measures real-world usefulness, not just test scores. For example, Claude Sonnet 4.5 can now handle tasks that take humans nearly 2 hours.

**My Analysis:** I analyzed METR-Horizon data comparing pre-reasoning models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, etc.) ...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Its some arbitrary threshold. For the analysis you need to have some treshold. They also do the analyis for 80% sucess rate and with similar results regarding the doubling time but, of course shorter time horizons.

Now, for some tasks where there failure rate is not that important and where there is supervision 50% sucess rate can be accaptable, since the models work a lot faster than any human can. An example is coding.

And the horizions seem to 5x every year, when we can extrapolate from the last year of progress in reasoning models so in a year 50% time horizons will be like around 10 hours andin 2 years 50 hours. With that increase, the reliability for shorter tasks will naturally increase also a lot.</div>
