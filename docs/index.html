Whenever I get on the phone with any customer service reps - such as making changes to my cell phone service, or making changes to my auto insurance, etc. - I *always* put the phone on speaker and type notes into an app I use called Joplin (basically, free OneNote).

Just don’t be a dick. We don’t have a ton of freedom to make exceptions or bend the rules. Our bosses literally record and listen to our calls to make sure we don’t cost the company money unnecessarily. Yes, we know a lot of the fare rules and conditions suck but we didn’t write the rules. We exist to inform you of what the rules are and to assist you in actioning any changes you want to make based on your own decision. If you treat us like human beings we are more likely to go the extra mile for you too. Being rude or insulting us will lead to us simply not giving a fuck about you and we will do our best to get you off the line as quickly as we can.</div>

This times 10,000

I did programming and reporting work that brought me into contact with the billing &amp; payables call center for a very large hospital.  

**The people there *want* to help you**.  They *want* make you happy.  Thing is, they have a job to do and a lot of times it will mean delivering unpleasant news, but they can help you make the best of a bad situation.  So LET THEM HELP YOU!!!!

When you call, give a brief explanation ("I paid a bill in full before the due date but was hit with late charges"; try to keep it to 25 words or less)

Then let them ask questions.  They know what info they need from you

Chances are they've dealt with your situation a thousand times and know how it fits into their system and policies.  So let them guide you.</div>

She didn’t make excuses or sound defensive or recite patronizing reassurances. She didn’t sneeringly call me ma’am like she was talking down to a Karen, or sound impatient, rushed, distracted, or indifferent. Maybe I’m a sucker for charm, but she came across as sincerely caring about my frustrations.  She understood how infuriating it had been to ride endlessly on a merry-go-round of menus before finally reaching an actual person.  I was so fortunate that this time the representative I reached actually communicated with me person to person as a human being instead of sounding like an indifferent, bored or annoyed robot reading a script.</div>

I spoke to the first rep, but I had questions he wasn't able to answer. I asked him to escalate to a supervisor and was eventually connected to one. I should mention, in past times I've had to call this company, every rep or supervisor has always immediately been edgy. They probably catch a lot of attitude from previous callers and it spills over to the next customer. Not great, but understandable, especially if they're getting shit on multiple times a day. Anyway, I spoke to the supe, and we actually just had a polite conversation. She referred to me as Mr. Central316 and I used her name. No one had an attitude. I got to ask my questions, and she gave me the answers. I asked if there were any discounts available, and lo and behold, she was able to knock $300 off of my bill! That would never have happened if I had been a dick to her. Patience and humanity, which should be standard practice, saved me a buttload of cash. It was one of the few times I paid out hundreds of dollars on a bill and felt good about it.</div>

It’s so awkward that it’s clear it’s just a tactic, and it loses its effect. Use it once after they introduce themselves - “hi, Janet, my names John…” and then once in the middle it it’s a longer conversation, and one more time as you’re getting off the phone. And always only when it feels natural with the flow of the conversation.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A brief history of speed limits in Montana:

* Montana originally added speed limits back in 1974 as a result of federal law, on pain of losing federal highway funding. The fine for speeding was under state control and set to $5 (about $32 today) and, from most accounts, barely enforced.

* The federal law was repealed in 1995 and Montana speed limits went to “reasonable and prudent”.

* A guy sued in 1996 because he got a ticket for going 85 - he thought that was reasonable and prudent, the cop disagreed - and it was decided in the state Supreme Court that officer discretion was a stupid idea, and the law itself needed to not be vague.

* The max speed limit was set to 75 in daylight in 1997, and raised to 80 in 2015. IIRC nighttime is still 70.

* Montana has typically seen a temporary increase in traffic deaths when speed limits go down, and a temporary decrease in traffic deaths when speed limits go up. In the latest case, traffic deaths went down until 2020 and started creeping back up.

* That said, Montana does have a nationally high rate of traffic deaths at any speed. Montana also has mountains, large animals that don’t understand traffic patterns, lifted trucks that don’t understand traffic patterns, and homes that are really far from the nearest bar along mountain roads with ice, snow, and high winds, in addition to the hundreds of miles of flat nothingness as you approach the Dakotas that give you plenty of time to decide to go literally anywhere else, for example the afterlife.</div>

Stating facts first keeps the situation grounded and protects you, especially when things are reviewed afterward.

Keep a cool head and only state facts you can prove. And even if you can prove something, if it's not part of your responsibility, keep quiet. 


Eventually someone willcome looking for heads to roll. You want yourself covered and you don't want to have made enemies. </div>

The education was changed about a century ago and all it's focus was put on making people be worker bees/slaves to the system instead of critical thinking. With the onset of TV/visual media and now social media, it has exponentially increased the output of drones.

No amount of money will change this as the problem is the education system itself. They don't want you to question anything, just follow orders and pass tests.</div>

If the news reports on "things that happen", and the things that happen in regards to Trump are "almost 100% negative", how is that anyone's fault but his?

There was plenty of "negative coverage" of, say, Biden during the withdrawal from Afghanistan, but you didn't see him bitching about it. It was a negative thing that was happening, so of course the coverage was "negative".</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">In my experience I find CrossFit gyms to be far more reflective of the local culture than they are of CrossFit. So I had radically different experiences between my gym in LA, my gym in New Mexico and my gym in NorCal. And having tried multiple boxes in LA and in New Mexico, I found them kind of similar in terms of vibe. If you live in a place that tends to be pretty welcoming and outgoing and inclusive, that will tend to be the vibe in your box. And if not, then not. 

Also bear in mind that there are shared experiences that start to bond people, and as you do them, you’ll find yourself in the community more and more. Things like doing the CrossFit open, Murph on Memorial Day weekend, if your gym has any kind of nutrition or accountability challenge participating in it, partner wods. These things are especially great for if you don’t have a particularly outgoing “welcome new people” culture. 

Final thought is that I really found myself a place in the community when I started going to open gym. Class time actually isn’t great for building community. It’s relatively short, it’s focused, you’re following the coach’s instructions, you’ve often got a lot to get done. 

Don’t stress. You’re showing up for you. You’re showing up for good coaching. If it really feels off it might be worth checking out a new box, but at six weeks I wouldn’t stress, try some of these things I’ve suggested and keep putting in the work. Just as the gains come slowly, so does the community.</div>

Going to a gym by work in an area full of tech companies the gym was mostly nerdesque people who were really friendly. Moved to another city and went to a gym in a trendy area and it was a sinilar vibe to the neighborhood, more cliquey and cool kids. I found a great group going to the later or noon classes though and still had a great time.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">6 weeks? Yeah give it time. But also, CrossFit is like any other activity in the sense that some gyms are very welcoming and friendly and others are less so. There's also the fact that not every person is a fit for every group. 6 weeks is too soon to make determinations like that, but if you still feel like an outsider in a few months, maybe it's worth checking out other gyms. </div>
