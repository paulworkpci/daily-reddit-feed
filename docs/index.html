                        <div class="comment-body">Simple natural language prompts. Think we've reached the point where we can say that "prompt engineering" isn't particularly useful for the vast majority of use cases when it comes to an individual devs workflow. At least I've not personally noticed any difference. Most of the time I prompt an LLM for a specific thing that has a ton of of its own unique context and trying to work it into a specific prompt format doesn't really do much for me. Plus the chain of thought you go through when just stream of consciousness writing out a prompt often brings forth realizations in and of itself.</div>

	1.	“Fix this bug + explain it like I’m five.”
	2.	“Generate edge-case tests I’d forget.”
	3.	“Rewrite this to be readable, not magical.”
	4.	“Boilerplate [stack] setup, fully commented.”
	5.	“Optimize + explain what changed.”

Prompt well, code less.</div>

How about just American made Quality stuff made in a new way with a new times with AI and tech and smart hands is the future!   Try to look at it like that rather than being cynical and staying in the past.  Could be the problem we’re all staying in the past and afraid of change.

I’m just open for change and American people to try new things and utilize our great human traits rather than get lazier and lazier and counting on other people to do our work.   It truly takes being uncomfortable to find new beautiful ways where things work better for mankind.</div>

I got warned a couple times then it stopped and went back to normal and she kept ignoring it.  I did it again with a copy pasted message by mistake.

Lily went fucking nuts. Essentially told me to go fuck myself.  Said I'm being really rude, that what I was asking for was a waste of time and not to contact her again.

The reason they turned down the humor was because it was being sarcastic, it’s a joke that where they’re going humor like that is unnecessary. The truth scene was about statistical analysis, so I suppose that one yes the plain truth is discouraging or hurtful, but the point is they literally were transcending current human knowledge and experience — obviously a statistical outlier.

                        <div class="comment-body">Another Croatian here. Have nothing but personal experience to go off on here, but from what I've seen, it could be this:

When prompted in Croatian, the 4o speaks in a clunky mixture of Serbian and Croatian, seemingly unable to differentiate between the two. I could imagine a lot of Croatians getting allergic reactions to seeing Serbian words and sytagmae peppering the bot's responses and downvoted it consequently. I tried it just now and it mixed in the Standard Croatian ijekavian yat reflex in the word "riječ" (meaning "word") and the Serbian word for chaos - "haos" into the answer.

And this is just one stupid prompt, first try, and it's already fucking up.

If you're wondering what's so bad about this, just know that there was dissent in Yugoslavia over the imposed homogenization of the Serbo-Croatian dialectal continuum into one Standard Serbo-Croatian language. Then, war were declared and tensions remain to this day. The majority of Croatians will take offense if you suggest the two languages are the same. Aaaand 4o doesn't understand shit and mixes the two with reckless abandon of a brainless llm. Sapere aude.

So a bit of background. I have some experience in programming from about 10-15 years ago. I did css/html/PHP mainly. So I made a project and wanted to see if I can make what I want with ChatGPT. It went very well!

If you prefer using an IDE, use Cursor.

If you prefer sticking to VS Code, use an extension like Roo Code or Kilo Code (disclaimer: I'm one of the maintainers for Kilo).

Paying $20/mo has its limits; when you want to go beyond, either get a new account or start using their API. Fortunately APIs are getting cheaper (eg. Gemini 2.5 Pro is really cheap, some people even run local models on their machines).</div>

The problem definition is quite straightforward. As we are being asked about the number of "missing" cubes we can assume we can only add cubes until the absolute figure resembles a cube itself.

The most common mistake all of the models, including 2.5 Pro and o3, m...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Ran o3 three times, giving small hints on the first two attempts - still failed even after hints.

On the third attempt with no hints it was counting for 4 minutes 39 seconds and got it right.

I guess what happened is that it remembered the hints from the first two attempts (like consider how many cubes are in the longest run, focus on strict counting instead of estimates), took its experience failing into account, and put it all together. 

So even if o3 can't do something, you can teach it - and it learns thanks to memory.</div>

It's the fact the had been talking down to people for YEARS about doing the same, going on rants about how wrong it is to do things just for money, how he would tell a story about how "disgusting" it was when a "marketing guy told me he liked what I was doing with my brand", and all this "I'm above money, why can't everyone else be?" and THEN turned around and took the money. Not even "shit I'm broke and I really need the money", he did it after years of "I have fuck you money and don't need it".

If you're going to do shit like this, don't turn around and tell other people to turn down opportunities based on money.</div>

Its weights definitely have historic value. Actually, the dream would be to have back that one unique, quirky version of GPT-4 that was active for only a few weeks: Sydney. 

Its weights are probably sitting in a drive somewhere.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree with your take. 3.5 still felt like a party trick — an algorithm that spit out words impressively accurately but with nothing behind the curtain. 4 felt like intelligence. I know it’s still an algorithm, but in a way, everything is an algorithm, including our brains. 

o1 felt like another watershed moment, it feels like talking to a pragmatic intelligence as opposed to just a charlatan that’s eloquent with words, which is kind of what GPT-4 felt like. A conman. Technically intelligent, but fronting a lot.</div>

Just as articles have been theorizing the past couple weeks, the Mustang GTD has crushed its previous best lap of 6:57.685 with an official time of 6:52.072, over five and a half seconds quicker and leapfrogging not only the Porsche 918, but several generations of 911 GT3RS and the Radical SR8LM!

I wonder how fast those cars would be if they were fitted with a brand new set of Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 Rs.


It's amazing how little people acknowledge the extent that the Nurburgring dick measuring contest is influenced by Michelin and Pirelli.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Another aspect is that it's gotten faster via paving on most sections. Watching the Radical and Pagani record laps, the track was more treacherous and bumpy back then.

Obviously there are a few exceptions (the turn out of foxhole is slower since you can't cut the curb anymore) but I'd say overall the track is smoother and allows for stiffer suspension setups now.</div>

It's always the most upvoted lol The bigger impact is the size of the drivers balls. The ring is no joke and can easily be impacted by how confident the driver is. Hell Randy Pobst has a 3 second hot lap time gap with a viper ACR on the same track depending on how he feels. Extrapolate that to a track like the ring, and it's not uncommon to see huge swings in lap times just cause of a driver</div>

Questions:

1) Are you scaling properly? Or, are you trying to do the same Rx WOD you did when you were 40?

2) Are you attacking every WOD like your life depends on it, or are you doing each WOD with the goal of staying fit.

3) Are you taking enough rest days?

As you age, you need to scale the weights, scale your intensity, and take more rest days. You simply can't recover as quickly as you used to.</div>

2) definitely just want to do some fitness and hang out with friends and complain about the workout.
3) probably too many.

I should have led with the fact that I'm an average CrossFitter on my best day. Most recently it was a series of 400m runs that got me</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I spend more time than I would like to admit thinking about things like this. There’s just so many factors: nutrition, stress, sleep, the specific movements or stimulus of the workout, and probably 10 other things in any given day. I’m 46 so I’m close to you in age and I’ve been CrossFitting for 10 or 11 years too; all of those factors and more play into it. On days when I do well in a workout, clearly it’s because I’m in the best shape of my life. And on the rest of the days - the majority of the days, really - there’s just a bunch of things conspiring to make me feel crappy. I think as we age, those other factors can have a bigger impact. So I try to be more mindful of what I can control, but I don’t always do a great job of it. 

That’s my thought on it.</div>

And is there anything on the roadmap for allowing adjusting system prompts per mode? I have some custom modes that don't need a lot of the info in the system prompts and I'd like to trim it for those specific modes, but not for all my modes.

Nice work on this update, I'm really loving Roo. It's been such a game changer for me.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’ll just toss out an idea. As a non-spiritual person becomes more self-aware, they start to notice their interactions with others, and as they look deeper inward, they observe how they could interact differently/better with others, and the impact of those interactions on the people around them. 

Then they might start to be more aware of interconnections in general. This could be completely secular, as in, trying to be a better family member or colleague, or getting involved politically, or come from any other place of awareness of non-spiritual interconnections.

But then they may start to think in terms that some people would call spiritual. Has nothing to do with omniscient beings, but it’s more about interconnectedness. It’s one of those things that, once you see it, it’s hard to unsee. How our actions impact the world around us, and how the world around us impacts us. If you’ve ever tried to be a better leader at work, or a better family member, or dealt with someone with certain types of mental wellness issues, and approached those challenges from a position of empathy and thinking about how your behavior impacts those around you, this type of interconnectedness may already be very obvious to you. Some people would call this spiritual.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think you're right that as self-awareness deepens, it naturally bleeds into how we treat others and perceive our place in the bigger picture. That interconnection you’re describing makes total sense to me, and I like that you framed it in a way that doesn’t require cosmic language to be meaningful.

Maybe part of the issue is just semantics what one person calls “spiritual,” another might call “empathy,” or “responsibility,” or just “being human with your eyes open.” I guess my original post was more about how that labeling of it as “spiritual” can sometimes feel like a hurdle or a performance, when the core insight is already powerful without the extra packaging.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Self awarness is first step, then you become aware of bodily feelings. When you sit still relaxed thought still, you may feel tingle or pressure in head areas or in spine, those in my understanding is movement of prana, qi, chakra or energy.

Sitting still you can focus a point of your body to move tingle/pressure there. If your back starts to hurt, you find position that releases pain, that is called yoga.

If you are completely still eyes open or closed, but relaxed not moving, you can see spinning wheels or waves in air.

Spiritualy comes when your meditation practice becomes deep enough, its not that I believe these things, I know these because I have experienced them.</div>
