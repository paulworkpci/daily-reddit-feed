Spoiler alert I like the robin sharma method of the 20/20/20
First 20 minutes some sort of activity preferably that you sweat.
Secondly reflection in yourself, journal or meditation.

First off, yeah, Greenland makes sense militarily. It’s basically a fortress in the Arctic. Whoever controls Greenland controls shipping routes, strategic airspace, and Arctic defense lines.

                                <div class="reply-body">There is a very clear precedent for this move, it's the reason the US acquired Alaska.

Now I have no idea how much it would take to turn a country into a state. All of the previous land acquisitions of the US were mostly purchases.

I'd suggest to make Puerto Rico a full state before Greenland. Make Greenland an unincorporated territory for a few years, like have a set date it would become the 52nd state, assuming PR becomes 51st, like 10 to 15 years.

Canada is a pipe dream, most likely just a joke to mock Trudeau. I'd expect Mexico to merge with Texas first.</div>

Over the past couple years I’ve endured my first ever management job that was very strenuous on my mental health with stress and anxiety. I tend to care after others a lot more as I like making people as happy as they can be. I’ve gained weight a lot especially over the past year or so.

                        <div class="comment-body">In the absence of any medical conditions, refined sugar and caffeine likely play a role. They're drugs, and some people are more sensitive to them than others. I had this exact issue you speak of and as a result had quit eating refined sugar entirely and quit drinking caffeine, which led to some awful withdrawal symptoms but those symptoms only reinforced how physiologically affected I was by my ongoing consumption. Took about 3 weeks for my brain fog to clear up by 70-80%. And it was really, really hard to get there.

I found, though, that even with the confusion, slow-thinking, and forgetfulness of brain fog put aside, I still had a terrible attention span. I wondered, why is this? I didn't have this issue when I was younger. Then I concluded that it's how over stimulated I am and how my brain is constantly being exposed to different information through social media without any processing. Training your brain to not be able to think properly, essentially... As a result, I turned to SERIOUS meditating regularly. I did 1 hour meditation every day. Not less than an hour as that had never worked for me. I am guessing that longer meditation is a more powerful restart button for the over stimulated mind.

It's been a long battle, tbf. I tried all the supplements, and it really seemed to be the shit that people said is 'OK in moderation' that was the problem. The difference is night and day. But it really depends on how motivated you are to fix these problems. As always, I suggest going to a doctor if this is something you think is not related to your lifestyle habits. These are just a few possible things to consider for yourself.</div>

I still drink caffeine but not after 6 though, I think it was more the carbs/sugars and exercise that were the variables in my case</div>

I'm in this boat too. My ADHD has been getting progressively worse over the recent (but more than 2-3) years, so I sought help though official channels for that.  
But aside from any official diagnosis - I am CONVINCED social media has trained my brain to be restless, my memory to become shoddy, my thoughts to become undecisive when not receiving the constant stimulation. Didn't use to be so bad. In my case, my diet didn't really change and I'm a prolific coffee devourer, but it doesn't have that chronic effect of brain fog on me.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Im surprised no one said Long Covid. This is one of the top lingering symptoms after an infection. Remember that with each infection, you have a higher chance to development long term effect. Covid is not a respiratory disease, it's a cardiovascular disease (that affect the lungs first, that's why people think it's just like the flu). So tell me which 4 organs that have the most blood vessels in the body : Brain, Heart, Lungs, Bowel. This is why people lost taste and smell for long time. Brain fog is one of the top10 Long Covid symptoms. I suggest you start checking there even if you dont believe in covid.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Funnily enough, it actually does, kinda.

You (or anyone, really) won't be able to measure it but if we assume that a 0 bit is at a lower energy level than a 1 bit and downloading onto a storage that's previously been all 0's, the addition of the 1's would imply additional energy (from the battery) so that at least your storage medium would become ever so immeasurably slightly heavier according to E=mc².

On the other hand, you lose energy from your battery and as heat so it might even get lighter.

So in the end it's not only that the actual increase in mass in the storage medium is basically imperceptible, it's most likely negated by other effects affecting overall energy (and mass) amounts in the phone.

But... Yeah, it kinda still does get heavier from downloading apps.</div>

I'm hoping the crowd can help me find and share this document because I'm not aware of it myself.</div>

&gt;**6. Lockheed Martin:** Grusch claims that (a) Lockheed Martin have had an intact UFO since the 1950s, (b) he knows exactly where the material has been stored, (c) DIA officers managed to forcibly break into the UFO, (d) Grusch did not have clearance to be briefed on what was found inside the UFO, (e) Lockheed Martin have wanted to divest themselves of the UFO material specifically because the level of extreme secrecy and compartmentalisation has prevented them from being able to bring in the right engineers to properly study the craft.

Also for some people reddit is just a snark contest lol. Don't take it personally they wouldn't have the gall to be rude to your face.</div>

This should be the golden #1 sticky rule shining on the frontpage and above every sub. Even moreso cause the bots are many... Makes life so much easier and social media soo less important.

And as silly as it sounds it takes practise to remember it, instead of going beastmode for evry rude comment.</div>

"I don't like mean people" Will be met with "well sometimes you have to be mean actually! What if you were talking to a mass murderer??"

 It's like bruh use your critical thinking skills to see that I or another OP is clearly not talking about that rare exception lol. 

It's like the people that rant about a character having bad writing, just because something they did wasn't spelt out to the audience and you actually have to think "is this in character, did they do this for reason a or reason b?". 

It's the same reason  I don't like the /s after texts.</div>

Five minutes. 
  
Versus an amount of time that literally has not existed yet in the entire history of our universe. In fact it's such a massive leap that it would take multiple quadrillions of the amount of time our universe has existed. 
  
Five minutes.

My friend sent me this video, and unfortunately, I don’t have the original link. In the clip, a family is watching strange light in the sky, debating whether it’s aliens, a star, or something else entirely. Then, right at the end, a kid screams, ‘No, no! It’s a meteorite!’ The whole thing is both scary and kind of funny. What do you guys think it could be?"

Edit/P.S.: I'm not going to answer all of you, but come on. Then make all posts go through a review. Because, honestly, this sub is 49.9% plain dumb stuff, 49.9% borderline or straight up misinformation, and the rest, the gold, is probably buried under all of it. You don't have to be a military person to know this is a flare. And, with all due respect, if you don't know what a flare looks like, then, I'm sorry, but what are you even doing/posting here?!</div>

They fail to realize that through their own human senses they are being "prompted" throughout their entire lives.

Once AI labs start pivoting to focus on the input side of the AGI equation - equipping models with "senses" that are in some sense always on - I think it will be much easier for people to recognize them for what they are. Pair that with expanding content windows to infinity and you've got a full blown "person."</div>

Five years ago our home burned down. This is my advice and tips on what happens next. I’m here to answer any questions.

Typically your insurance policy will have three main categories: Relocation coverage, content coverage and structural coverage.

Check your insurance policy for how much relocation coverage you have. Chances are you could have anywhere from 25k to unlimited coverage (most policies have a max, I changed ours to unlimite...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is really really really good and helpful and I wish I had this earlier this year. My mother's house burned down in early 2024 and I went through the whole process with her. I'll strongly back what (edit)the OP saying. A few things to add from my experience: (The house was fully rebuilt down to the studs)

--The restoration companies aren't direct scams, but absolutely predatory like the OP said. You're better off calling around to other contractors to discuss building house. Our contractor not only rebuilt the house, but even added a restroom, gave a new roof (they are a roofing company first) and they redid my mother's shower to be a better fit for a senior citizen. While I won't say every contractor will be that good, most that the insurance will offer, or the restoration company will offer, will be bare minimum at BEST. MY ADVICE: Check with 3 contractors, go with the one who you feel best about. 

--Sleep on EVERY DECISION, I know you want your house to be worked on asap, but believe me it's a LONG process, an extra week will NOT HURT YOU. A hasty decision very likely can. Go with your gut, but talk to others to make sure you're thinking clearly. Many companies WANT you distracted. Don't fall for it.

--Take lots of photos as soon as it happens. Your insurance will likely send you a spreadsheet for you to label everything you lost in the fire and will make you do the work, knowledge is power. My mom got way more back than the insurance initially offered by having photos of everything, and legitimate prices. (For instance, they offered $15 per hardcover book, gtfo, those are easily $45-40, she got THOUSANDS back for her library instead of the 1.5k the insurance offered initially).

--Gonna be real, and this will feel scary at first, but more than likely if your house is totaled your items will be too. Don't try and spend too much money fixing things, my brother managed to save quite a few items, but half of them ended up having some issues a few months after salvaging them. A few things to 100% get rid of: Electronics. Clothes(ABSOLUTELY GET RID OF THEM I'M SO SORRY), old furniture/any furniture with cloth on it. MEDICINE! (I cannot stress this enough, get rid of all medicine)

--While this isn't as important, I'd say find advocates, if you're part of a church or community reach out, people WANT to help. It was HEAVEN knowing I had friends who were walking through things with my family. Donations REALLY helped.

--ABSOLUTELY MOST IMPORTANTLY understand you WILL get through this!!!! I know 2 families now who have gone through this terrible thing, both of them have recovered everything and then some by being diligent and walking through the process slowly.

LARGE construction companies have HUGE overhead expenses. They will be far less likely to work with you as they have a lot to pay (Employees, contractors, advertising, marketing, CEO, president, president's wife, president's dog, etc). Just be wary of that.

Don't hesitate to go with smaller contractors WHO HAVE A SOLID REPUTATION THAT CAN BE BACKED UP. 

Don't be afraid to even ask for them to recommend customers you can reach out to and talk to about their expreince. We had that opportunity with ours and the handiwork is what sold my mom to choose her contractor.</div>

Cloth, on the other hand, can sometimes be saved from smoke damage IF you get specialty cleaning, but that’s expensive so for items that aren’t sentimental or costly to replace it can make more financial sense to get paid out for the loss.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree but here’s my scenario….our fire was officially put out at 3:40am. We were standing in front of what was left of our burned home at 6:46am when a truck pulls up and says “your insurance sent us, we can save whatever is left and restore it to new and your insurance will pay us. Also, we are authorized to access the property to do this”. This is important because your house is red tagged and you are forbidden to enter, BUT they can. Of course, you sign the papers and lose a lot of rights because they play on emotions.</div>

The reason Trump wants to label them that way is to justify an invasion of Mexico, with or without Mexico’s approval.

Edit:  cartels are awful and need to be burned to the ground. But they are criminal organizations, not terrorist organizations. Meaning you deal with them the way you legally should. You don’t just relabel them so you can just do whatever the fuck you want.</div>

At the time of thIs clip it was Eddie Bravo, Joey Diaz, Tait Fletcher, Duncan, etc. 

So his personality was a mix of stoner conspiracy theories about UFOs and Bigfoot, BJJ, Bro science, and Diaz impressions.  It was all big hits on volcanos and edibles. DMT, altered states, hulk loads, big black cocks.  

Now he hangs out with different people.  Government people.  Ex military.</div>

&gt;The number of USB ports on a motherboard depends on the model, but most have multiple USB headers, usually between two and six or more. Some motherboards may have as many as 23 USB ports. 
Many modern motherboards have at least one or two USB-C ports. USB-C is a popular choice for newer devices because it's small, can transfer data quickly, and can carry up to 240W of power. USB-C cables can also carry 4K and 8K video. 
You can tell if a USB port is USB 3.0 if it has a blue tab, but the color may vary. You can also check the Device Manager to see if your computer has USB 3.</div>

Your thoughts aren't your own, they're made for you by the mainstream media. Your opinions and outlook were manufactured by someone else and are effortlessly implanted in your brain. You are vulnerable to propaganda and will accept any narrative that lets you believe you are looking down on others, superior and real, meanwhile you aren't in control of your own neural firings. You have willingly made yourself not fully human in exchange for wrongly believing you know better.

This woman is ignoring a biased internet troll after cutting a trip short to return to an emergency in which she is needed. She doesn't have time for his bullshit because she has important work to do. You would be able to see this, except you are enjoying the story you're being told by the media. Do better.</div>

It's clear that we are in the long spectrum that is agi. Humanity never needed to consider how to support growth in this phase. It's now time.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yea, I feel like once there are agents that can 'make money on the internet', then the monetary value of anything those agents can do will approach 0 very quickly. Like pennies per book written, or video created. The value of an agent's work will approach the value of the electricity and hardware required to do the work. We already see this with some digital currencies, as only 'miners' which are in ideal locations (low electric cost, low heating cost) can make any money. I imagine it will be the same for these agents that can create goods/services</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly this is always on my mind - do I have to worry all that much about retirement?

I just lost my well paying job. Wife is stay at home mom. We have some money saved, but I wanted a bit more before we FIRE (retire early) for good. Another 5 years of work (with wife going back to work too). We have perhaps enough money for a lean-FIRE in Europe as is anyways. And I'm thinking about just pulling the plug instead of looking for a job in this shitty tech job market. Even if we spend more than the investment income allows.

With the way automation is progressing there is a very good chance that most human workers are going to be obsolete within the next 10-20 years (especially white collar, less so in trades, but that will come too eventually). Some kind of UBI (Universal Basic Income) is quite likely in the developed world to just keep the economy from completely collapsing as unemployment rises rapidly even as productivity skyrockets. Or lower retirement age, etc, etc.

Another darker scenario would be future catastrophe like global nuclear war, climate change causing collapse of the ecosystems, economic and civilizational collapse, annihilation by AI, in short a scenario where you are most likely dead or a grimdark world where money has no value anymore anyways. Or you know you can just drop dead from the myriad of possible causes in the next year or two - so why not FIRE ASAP to enjoy the life while the sun still rises?</div>

&gt;In AlphaGo, just training on human data only got to amateur level. But once they cracked high-compute RL, then superintelligence was inevitable.

If he has true knowledge of such things, perhaps they allow it as part of their wish to inform the public.  
If he doesn't have true knowledge, but it also happens to be true, I assume they are fine with him reporting on rumours and the general vibe at OpenAI.  
If he doesn't have true knowledge and it happens not to be true, perhaps they are happy to have the hype.  
  
Either way, it's interesting that such posts are allowed.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I just spent a few hours reading two neuroscience journal articles in full,  and while I do have other ways I'm exposed to research articles in my field (and would like to subscribe to physical journals one day if it was ever affordable), I mainly get them sourced through facebook groups I'm in related to my profession. A lot of the times they link to the summary media write-up though, so I go to the link provided in the article to the actual research. I think my time was well-spent.

I don't think a blanket anti-intellectual stance against "educational content" should be taken - it's about what sources you're exposed to (and using critical thinking to navigate that) and what you choose to do with them.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The value of knowledge can't be accurately measured by the number of "actionable takeaways." For many people, regularly learning new things is an important goal in and of itself. Whether or not a given piece of information produces measurable value is beside the point.  

I agree that there's entirely too much "edutainment" type content out there. Shows that pretend to be informative, but dumb everything down instead of challenging your brain. Pop-science articles that mischaracterize the research and don't cite their sources. Podcasts spreading old misinformation. But those are all problems of lazy writing and passive consumption - not an indictment of the value of learning.  

**Tl;dr learning is important and brings joy. Don't let some cult of productivity nonsense dissuade you from listening to a podcast about dinosaurs if you want to.**</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The Never Ending Story, when the horse dies,  was the first time I cried during a movie. Our school used to do a cinema day once a month where they played movies in the school hall and unfortunately the same few movies rotated every 6 months or so. I watched the movie for the first time at one of these showings and didn't really let anyone know I was crying. The second time they showed the movie, I thought I was prepared for the scene but nope, proper snotty tears and sobbing that time. By the third time they showed the movie, I told my teacher I was sick and got myself sent home from school. I still can't watch the movie without crying my eyes out.</div>

&gt;This is @fchollet discussing deep learning guided program synthesis, reasoning, o-series models and the ARC challenge.  We will drop the full video hopefully later today!

So he thinks the model is running a search process in the space of possible chain of thought wich in the end ends up generating a "natural language program" describing what the model should be doing and in the process of creating that program the model is adapting to novelty. o1 is a "genuine breakthrough" in terms of generalization powers wich you can achieve with these systems, showing progress "far beyond the classical deep learning paradigm".</div>

Every interview in the past which I saw of him he was saying that no system was having any generality and we're very far off from AGI. Now he's talking about breakthroughs, generality and the newer models having some intelligence. That's a big shift from his earlier position. So I don't see your point here.</div>
