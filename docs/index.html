the results of all these llm's are going to depend on the input prompts you provide and questions you ask. but you can see clear differences in the level of detail in the response.

Also I don't know if this is new but I can now also ask to give me downloadable links for the code instead of having to copy/paste like in grok etc.</div>

Claude does does code 'too much' daily. 
And also forgets if I only asked to check things and goes on a programming rampage based on that.

GPT 5 on the other hand you can be specific and you get a very good and detailed answer. It does not goes of path.

But Claude will find edge cases I did not think of and catch those for me. 

So I use both extensively now.</div>

its also much easier to have the chat with the llm in a single page on the website and refine based on that. once I have working code and need incremental changes thats when the vscode/cli tools work better.</div>

Yes, it has quirks of its own, model router is buggy and there were issues with context so prompts and workflows must be updated.

                                <div class="reply-body">I tend to experiment with most models I can. I found GPT-5 great. for broad high level planning and even great at getting down to details afterwards, it has a nice balance of working with me and sticks to prompts on this very well. I still find Sonnet better for actual code implementation though. (for me it has kind of filled the same role Opus had before but GPT won't need to cut into my coding budget and so I can dedicate all my Claude tokens just to implementation now)

Do I think GPT-5 is superior to other models? absolutely not. but GPT feels like it is back in the game again other than just being the default for popularity reasons. GPT-5 is a fine model and very nice to work with and it might be my favourite for some tasks such as initial planning and brainstorming :)</div>

I wanted to start by saying a massive thank you to everyone following my journey, here in this forum. My last two posts, one about stopping mindless consumption and one where I meditated for 40 days and shared my experience, got way more attention and heartfelt responses than I ever expected. It’s honestly been overwhelming (in a good way) to see how many of us are searching for something deeper.

But I also read the comments. Some of you shared that you felt lost, or that your ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I've been meditating since 2013 and still I do/say/think things that "would not fit" a person who has meditated for more than 10 years, gone on retreats and so on. When my actions are unwholesome, that's when real growth happens, that's when I'm really confronted with my own foolishness and I have the opportunity to use it, turn it into wholesome actions. We recite the four great vows in my Sangha and it goes a bit like this:

1. Sentient beings are numberless. I vow to save them all.
2. Delusions are endless. I vow to cut through them all.
3. The teachings are infinite. I vow to learn them all.
4. The Buddha Way is endless. I vow to attain it.

To me there is no such thing as "getting there" and being done with it. There's no "if I meditate x minutes every day I'll get y". Do not expect some guaranteed linear growth towards "success" though life has completely changed for the better because I've been meditating every day for so long. I'm truly fortunate to have stumbled (yes stumbled) upon this path. Remember to just keep practising and that real growth is often off the mat/in the marketplace.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Great post. It's very funny because wanting to be "better" in some way is why we all start meditating. But in that "betterment" are so many avenues of doubt and also self-judgement. Once again suffering stemming from our greed of becoming a master of samsara.

I'm still as much of a monkey as the day I was born, and it definitely is a bit frustrating sometimes when you look back with a judgemental view and think "What the fuck has gotten better?"

But as you say, it's not about reaching some kind of perfection. It's about using the tools we have to try and navigate and survive as we know how.

Something that has been kind of nice to realize: We often think of doubt as a bad thing, but I currently feel like doubt is a natural piece of the human machine, a mental feature we have to continually question if we're going the right way, or doing the right thing. I've found it more helpful for me to use doubt as an alarm for me to double check myself and my intentions while I am on the path. Of course when one is uncertain, the doubt can feel heavier, but I guess that's just the way that is as well. For how can we be 100% about anything anyway?</div>

Let your power users decide best what they need. I get the update is geared at making it less confusing for most people, but that's why you have a simple toggle in the settings for these things.

The old way is like slowing down the smartest kid in class for the people that take 3 days to learn one topic. It's not fair, and they should both be accommodated in a way that suits them. One size fits all is not the way, and I respect Sam for changing it back.

Also super nostalgic seeing o3 and o4 in the picker.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Sam Altman announced a chunky ChatGPT update: a mode picker for GPT‑5 with Auto, Fast, and Thinking, plus a big 196k‑token context for Thinking. Weekly usage is being raised to as many as 3,000 GPT‑5 Thinking messages, with spillover routed to a lighter Thinking mini after you hit the cap. After user backlash, OpenAI also restored GPT‑4o in the model list for paid users and added a settings toggle to surface additional or legacy models.

                                <div class="reply-body">Better talk with dr. ZHANG :

"The Chinese science and technology media outlet Kuai Ke Zhi reported on the 8th an interview with Zhang Qifeng, a PhD at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, who is developing the pregnancy robot. The pregnancy robot he envisions is not an incubator but a humanoid, with a womb in its abdomen that can replicate the entire process from conception to delivery.

The key to the pregnancy robot is the "artificial womb" technology, where the fetus grows inside the artificial womb filled with artificial amniotic fluid and receives nutrients through a hose.

                                <div class="reply-body">Eh, it depends. Like putting aside all the doomer "there won't be free elections in 2028" rhetoric, Newsom won't be running against Trump. He'll be running against some other Republican, likely a Trump sycophant.

Newsom is pretty divisive in California. Like 50/50 support for him. But the one thing that he's consistently gained support for is his fight against Trump. He's emboldened to act this way and to act aggressively because he knows that Californians want him to. Put him on the national stage, though, and it's a different story, especially if we're talking about a post-Trump era.

Like the way that you become a successful Californian politician is just different from how you become a successful politician on the national scale. It's no coincidence we've only had one Californian-born President and that fucker just so happened to be the only President to be essentially thrown out of office. To a lot of people outside of California, Newsom may seem like a "leftist" politician, but a lot of people in California view him as one of the faces of moderate corporate Dems.

But at the same time, maybe Dems do still need to run a moderate. As much as progressives want to bitch and moan about Newsom (and now Buttigieg), who else is going to step up? Where is this mythical progressive messiah that we're all waiting for to save us? Bernie is too old now, AOC likely will be running a primary against Schumer, Zohran is an immigrant, so who else will Dems run? Tim Walz is probably the only option that I can think of.

3 years is enough time for a lot of things to happen, but if there isn't another strong candidate and if Newsom keeps up this rhetoric and actually follows through with actions, I think he'll be a clear frontrunner.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I work at an auto repair shop for about 10 years. A friend of mine recently asked me for a simple checklist on what to look for when checking a car before buying, and I figured I’d share it here — catching issues early can save you a lot of money and stress later.

**Here’s the checklist I gave them:**

1. **Check the vehicle history** – Use the VIN to see if the car’s been in accidents, had flood damage, or was totaled before. A quick report can reveal things the seller might not mention.
2. **...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I would add a couple small things: 

* Check the tires for cracks on the sides or low tread. Tires have become an expensive maintenance item so you'll want to factor them into your price.
* Check the suspension for excessive rust. Surface rust (just looks reddish and rough) is generally ok, but flakes are bad. 
* Depending on your state, check for common inspection issues. Google what the catalytic convertor on that car looks like and make sure it's there. They are commonly stolen, and also commonly replaced with a straight pipe to pass a sound and visual check.</div>

The person talking about the model manipulating people isn’t associated with OpenAI. You were clearly confident this was another OpenAI manipulation scheme. Maybe your mistake here can help you reflect on how you might be making excessive assumptions. 

Yes the model is sycophantic, and yes this is partly to make casual users like their model more. As the other user stated, this was due to reinforcement learning for engagement. And now GPT-5 is released and the sycophancy is greatly reduced. If you were to keep the same attitude, you would be forced to say “OpenAI is purposefully making their model less addictive by removing sycophancy”. But you would never say that.</div>

Claude Code wipes the floor with Cursor in terms of speed and quality.

Other tools give similar in IDE behavior, but directly in VSCode, and at a lower price.

                        <div class="comment-body">I basically love Cursor's UI and workflow, but I love Claude Code's results...so I use both. Cursor's autocomplete is undoubtedly an efficiency boost, along with the inline chat that I use all the time for asking questions and small edits and CC's terminal-based approach doesn't work for me since a lot of coding I do is not these huge feature requests but thousands of little tweaks and modifications across multiple disciplines.

I imagine Anthropic will eventually release a VS Code extension similar to that of Augment Code and that will be the death knell for Cursor, but for now, Cursor's UI and autocomplete is unmatched in the industry (for me, anyway).</div>

EDIT: For those downvoting... all three companies charge different rates for individual devs vs businesses. Cursor keeps things affordable for individuals, but jacks up the price when a business wants to foot the bill for their employees.</div>

Why the downvotes? I had access to GPT3 during the beta for *a year and a half* before chatGPT came out and played with it almost every day. Have you guys downvoting ever even used 3 at all?</div>

The image and prestige it brings won’t be matched. Folks don’t buy a G for offroad use, nor it being the most comfort, most spacious or fast SUV. It’s about the image.</div>

I think BMW's current design would actually translate best to a big ole box, so I'm interested to see where this goes. I wonder what INEOS will think of this considering they're using the BMW drivetrain in basically a hardcore offroader version of this idea.</div>

“Greenwashing” is a relevant term

Essentially being sold environmental solutions that are only incrementally better and don’t really resolve any of those issues

You know why?

Because the answer is a complete reduction of overall consumption and anti-capitalism. Reusable and sustainable things are not profitable for corporations.</div>

This happened a couple years ago and the meteorologist responded to the controversy. Apparently, he was just having technical problems:

"*"My computer just crashed one week," said Quinlan, who is based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. "Then I had to use my colleague's computer to complete my weathercasts. And back then they happened to have a different temperature color contour on their national temperature map."*"

None of this is to say that there aren't nefarious interests trying to monetize climate change for their own benefit. I just don't think this is an example of it.</div>
