                <div class="post-content">Nayeli Clemente passed away after having a medical emergency during Event 1 of the CrossFit licensed event.  Her brother posted on instagram that the response from the medical team was slow, unorganized and not adequate. Difficult for them to actually access where the event was taking place, medical equipment not set up for when it was needed, etc. 

With this being a CrossFit licensed event what does that mean? Are they following guidelines from CrossFit for the medical team and preparations?  </div>

However, if they care about safety they should issue guidelines or better strict rules about safety that people who want to use their name must respect in order to do a "CrossFit" event.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Plaintiff lawyers are going to have their way with CrossFit. It is explicitly involved based on the use of the official licensed name. Additionally, the fact that CrossFit has mandated other things for events like this (I.e. No open water swimming) creates a duty related to safety at these events. Not mandating a medical team by on site is absolutely idiotic when your name is on the event.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Have you read the legal terms of the agreement between the event organizer and CrossFit?  Do you have legal expertise in Mexico?  There are a lot of comments on legality on this thread that are premature. 

I can see how this negatively affects the brand. Ethically, when more is known perhaps we can assess if CrossFit should be doing more to ensure safety of the athletes at sanctioned events. I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect a lot out of them for an event that they didn’t organize.</div>

Forget the Fancy Terms. Just Do This:

1. **Sit. Focus on the breath.** Or one simple object.

2. **When distracted, return.** (No guilt, no drama.)  

3. **Repeat daily.**  

That’s it. **Samadhi, Jhāna**—they’re just labels for natural milestones your mind will hit if you stick with it.  

- **The mind naturally deepens** with consistent practice.  

- **Concepts can confuse more than help.** 

Debating "Was that *upacāra-samādhi* or *parikamma-samādhi*?" is useless.

                        <div class="comment-body">TRUTH!! When I would rise at 5am, and do these 3 simple steps, I finally “heard” “god” (or whatever we wanna call it, let’s keep it simple, right? It’s all the same!), I truly walked in a state of 24/7 samadhi. I even would enter bodily vibrations AT WILL, I went from never being able to wake up without being groggy and I SLEPT A LOT, to only need 5 hours of sleep, I literally gained the confidence of a god incarnate, but no desire to dominate ANYTHING, yet all came to me. 

Every word is true, all else honestly distracts with pretty lingo and expectation, better to become the embodiment of the cosmic expression, than to experience it? Even if at its highest, no? 

Tell me if any of this lines up!! Thank you for this solid simple reminder!!!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You’re right that there’s no substitute for practice. But there are many people who sit for years and get nowhere. Then they get a new instruction and try a new technique and all of a sudden there’s progress. That’s why all the discourse around the path, obstacles and mental states matters. 

In a way it’s simple once you get it, but getting it from 3 simple instructions isn’t enough for most people most of the time - that’s why you iterate and explore it from different angles and gradually zero in on what works.</div>

It has the intelligence, it has the knowledge, it has the underlying capability, but it is lazy to the point that it is unusable for real world coding. It just won't do the work.

At least with ChatGPT, haven't tried via the API as the verification seems broken for me.

Hopefully o3 pro fixes this.</div>

Anthropic did something very similar with the jump from 3.5 to 3.7 Sonnet. You’d get great responses with 3.5 and then all of a sudden 3.7 would only output a tiny amount and ask “Would you like me to continue?” This saves them money since you’ll use up your limited messages before you cost them too much in inference.</div>

Usually just a rough draft of a small file at most and I'd do the rest of the work. I have no clue how good it'd be for vibe-coding, but vibe-coding feels very worrying to do on work code.

The only coding complaint I have for it is that it's a little too eager to add comments. Good code should have minimal comments since the code itself should be readable enough that few things need an additional explainer.

It just feels like o1, but smarter. Not much to complain about or praise.</div>

It refuses to do any work anymore and would instead give you quick summaries. or "part 1" or "the first pass".

Also it refuses to give you full code and would only give snippets, and those snippets would lead to more errors because for some reason it decides to change the variable names. so that you cant copy/paste it into your project.

almost like it knows and wants you to do more work.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That's definitely one way to interpret this.  The CIA is open about how everything they do has to be in-house, they hire makeup artists, SFX designers, librarians, and all sorts of roles we wouldn't necessarily associate with the CIA but that's how they've always been.

I remember years ago at university whenever we would have CIA officers at the career fair they were always advertising that they were "degree agnostic" because "every role has a place in the CIA" - while that's just cushy language it's also the absolute truth.  They have to keep as much internally as possible for opsec reasons.  

They **want** us to think they are everywhere, when realistically they are 90% in-house behind a desk, 10% foreign/domestic meddling on-the-ground.</div>

You don't need to read war &amp; peace to be proud of your reading.
You will have the feeling of accomplishments with a short book and it take like one hour to read (over 4 days it's only 15min a day, over one week even less) that's what i do and I've read like 6 or seven books since September (not that much but better than 0) </div>

Do liberals get to decide that it is OK to move forward with an AI that can take over the security of the middle east and disarm Israel?


Do conservatives get to decide that it is OK build the low cost laborers AI so they can stop immigration?

                                <div class="reply-body">these are the basic rules:

1- No company will slow itself down without the government to force them to cooperate and slow down.

2- No government will slow itself down without all countries somehow being forced/agreeing to cooperate and slow down.

3- Even if all countries cooperate and agree to slow down, the rules need to be extremely serious, and countries need to share way too much information to make it impossible for countries to hide secret research and ensure everyone is on the same page. And there has to be serious consequences for violating these rules.

If you manage to achieve all of these things (which is really, really hard), then you probably have a somewhat better chance of not getting fucked by the race to ASI, but it would still be a tossup is my guess. And to answer your question, probably all of them would have some sort of say on it for this to happen.</div>

Because slowing the progress to hand the power over future AGI to those "institutions" sounds like *such a great idea* for everyone else. But I guess with a pretty movie and a professionally convincing voice actor to sound it, you can run circles around quite a number of people.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This isn't some grand conspiracy. This is an attempt to guide AI on a path that will benefit us as a society, rather than being used to exploit us.

It's been shown repeatedly throughout history with new technology that it can be extremely advantageous to establish organizations that can agree on standards, set barriers and promote the health of the industry.

If you want to look at some of the bigger AI mis-steps so far, look at how Google fired all their AI safety researchers, then their AI recommended people eat rocks or put glue on pizza. Look at how OpenAI just had to roll back their super-zealous release of ChatGPT because it would complement the user all the time and told them how smart they were.

These types of issues are likely to get worse and more damaging as the technology takes bigger steps and becomes more capable. You absolutely want to have research and testing structures in place before someone unleashes a superhuman and powerful AI, asks it to solve climate change - and it decides humans are the biggest threat to the environment and must all be destroyed.

The current pace of AI development is looking like the expression "ready, fire, aim!" ...and it has great potential to be extremely dangerous to us all if we're not careful.</div>

There are some examples of AI having insights and aiding in the formatting of text, but AI isn't replacing the actual work of structuring hypotheses, laying out goals, performing experiments, analyzing results and forming conclusions (particularly in context with the rest of a field).


It can do some of these things, like analyzing results and forming conclusions, but with drawbacks. It does better the more established the knowledge, so it is useful for me to learn basics, but not understanding cutting edge stuff. It also needs its hand held to avoid making simple mistakes.


A lot of what we see is just a super-powered auto-complete. Again, super useful for reading code library documentation and troubleshooting simple systems, but as you add complexity it falls apart or hallucinates more.</div>

But then WHY THE HELL DOES CLAUDE OUTPERFORM THEM ALL?!

Gemini 2.5 was good for javascript. But it is shitty in advanced python. Chatgpt is a joke. 03 mini generates shit code. And on reiterations sometimes provudes the code with 0 changes. 
I have tried 4.1 on Windsurf and I keep going bavk to Claude, and it's the only thing that helps me progress!

These days google's gemini models are praised by many people. 

Especially users from cline and roo code and the comments from these users makes it sound louder.

But now I have a silly condition with roo code using preview/exp-2.5 and flash-2.5. I try to refactor some old buggy code. 

When the context out of 200k, the cost then rocket up. Each request will take 0.7\~ dollar. But after more than 10 rounds, it just loops over a adding/removing line of ":start\_line 133".  So ...</div>

Learn about context windows, how LLM calls work. They aren't doing some black magic, they are jamming tokens into a context window. It has nothing to do with Gemini itself, they can handle a ton of tokens just like Claude. It comes down to managing the context window and that's why you spend so much per chat right now. It's totally unmanaged.

                        <div class="comment-body">As someone who's been using AI for code generation extensively since ChatGPT first came out. My experience is that most of the people who are failing with AI are generally failing because their prompts are inadequate.

I work for a high-end tech consulting firm. I'm currently on the most AI-enabled team I've ever been on. Everyone on the team is using Cline with Gemini 2.5 pro extensively. We use AI for all kinds of things, including as a pre-PR review.

We are all advanced LLM users with a lot of experience writing prompts. To give you an idea, I'll frequently spend 20-30 minutes writing a prompt. I've spent multiple hours spread out over days on some of my bigger ones.

And then you have to look at the code it produces and you need to watch for when it's going off the rails, which can happen. You have to be a programmer to know if you're getting good code or not and whether or not the design is sound.

If you know what you're doing, if you know what to give the LLM as context and know how to communicate with it, it's incredibly effective.

We're 3 weeks into a 7 week project and we've already completed all the goals of the project. The next 4 weeks are doing wish-list items for the client.

LLMs are complicated and powerful tools and like any complicated, powerful tool they require expertise to use effectively.</div>

Spent closer to thirty hours last week doing architecture and technical project planning with a lot of assistance from Gemini 2.5 but at the end of the day I know how the project will work, that the architecture is sound and will allow for a maintainable codebase. I plan to spend the next day or so decomposing of into Epics and tasks and then those into prompts to be implemented.

I used to think if my intentions were good, that was enough. Turns out, people don’t always hear what you mean—they hear what hits them.

I heard this line somewhere: “What you’re talking is not important, it’s about how they receive it that matters”. That stuck.

Now I pause before I speak, ask myself, “Will this actually help or just sound smart?” It’s a small shif...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Using nuanced language and being more specific helps immensely. 


"You're always late, it's insanely disrespectful that you abuse my time." Puts someone on the defensive. It's also not accurate or the truth. 


"When you're late more than 5 minutes, which you sometimes do, I feel is disrespectful to me and my time. I'm late at times, too, what can we do to reduce how often this happens?" 


The latter is more truthful, precise, and will get someone to see where you're coming from without feeling attacked. 



But the former black and white, simplified, extreme and dishonest language is what gets others outside of the discussion to validate your feelings. If you were honest about what happened, they'd see you're exaggerating, and maybe have more blame. 


Its not about being right. Its everyone in the discussion vs the problem.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The flip side to this is understanding that the person talking to you is talking in order to be heard. A little validation goes a long way.

“I hear you.”

“I understand.”

“I get what you’re saying.”

“That makes sense.”

“I get why you feel that way.”

Get comfortable saying these phrases. People will enjoy talking to you more if they receive validation like this. You’re not buttering them up. You’re literally just letting them know they’re being heard. So many people listen to respond rather than listening to understand.</div>

At some point humans will need to accept that almost all art and creativity is derivative to begin with, and start viewing AI as an *extension* of human creativity, rather than a parody of it.</div>

Ai will dramatically lower the barrier to entry for creative work. Is it eliminating many highly skilled jobs? Surely, but those same people  now have the resources of an entire workforce at their fingertips. You and (if you choose not to work alone) a small number of collaborators can now work together to shape your vision while AI does the mundane. You reduce your overhead from an entire office of people to a small board or C-suite and a few subscriptions.</div>

going from 90th percentile to 99th is going from say 50,000 to 5000 But 99th to top is 5000th to 1st.

so its selecting the top 1/10 in the first jump and the top 1/5000 in the second jump</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;We empirically demonstrate that, surprisingly, the training dataset for RLVR can be reduced to as little as ONE example! This finding supports recent claims that base models already possess significant reasoning capabilities [13, 20, 6, 21], and further shows that a single example is sufficient to substantially enhance the base model’s mathematical performance. [...] We highlight an intriguing phenomenon in 1-shot RLVR: post-saturation generalization. Specifically, the training accuracy on the single example rapidly approaches 100%, yet the model’s test accuracy continues to improve. Moreover, despite using only one training example, overfitting does not occur until after approximately 1.4k training steps. Even post-overfitting, while the model’s reasoning outputs for the training example become incomprehensible multilingual gibberish mixed with correct solutions, its test performance remains strong, and the reasoning outputs for the test examples remain human-interpretable. [...] Lastly, we find that employing entropy loss alone, even without any outcome reward, achieves a 27% performance boost on MATH500 for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B.


TLDR:

This paper shows that training a small LLM (Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B) on just one math example with RL can double its accuracy on MATH500, from 36% to 73.6%. Two examples outperform a 7.5k-sample dataset.

Key points:

Works across models and tasks (even non-math).

Promotes general reasoning, not memorization.

Performance keeps improving after training accuracy saturates (they call it "post-saturation generalization").

Just entropy loss alone (no rewards!) still gives a +27% gain.

Amazing what our statistical parrot friend can do! Definitely going straight into the "papers to post when someone claims an LLM can't generalize out of its dataset" or "just a parrot, bro" folder.</div>

Everything worked as expected, it was the easiest car to drive I have ever driven and it got close to 50MPG.

If I didn’t have to plow in the winter I’d still be driving the second Tacoma. Unfortunately, the kind of plowing I need to do requires at least a 3/4 ton.</div>

Like an advanced version of the word predictions you get when typing on a phone.

Even if I start a sentence, I can change it 'on-the-go' because I see someone looks confused, for example. I can also immediately add certain key info to my long term memory and use that info in the next sentence, or years from now (if it's important enough).

Maybe it's still some form of auto-complete but I think the sheer amount of continuous inputs humans get makes it an order of magnitude better/different.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The models predict what comes next in a sequence.  This is so fundamental.  It's how all of the sciences work.  We develop models to predict what comes next in space and time.  Usually these laws get broken down into something like a differential equation or a function of some form.  

Maxwell's Equations of electromagnetism, for example, are a set of differential equations that, if you know what is current in space and time (boundary/initial conditions), will tell you what comes next.

Predicting what comes next in a sequence is an extremely valuable skill to have... in fact all skills are of this form.  It is, as you mention, how our brains developed.  Predicting what comes next has great survival value.  Even the first bacteria with an [eye spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyespot_apparatus) would start moving in response to reduced light indicating a predator above it blocking the sun.  It had figured out patterns in the environment that allowed it to predict the future for its survival.

Prediction of what comes next is everything.

There is nothing special about transformers in this sense. They are another kind of general purpose function fitting tool.  Learning/training is non-linear regression of a general purpose function onto a massive volume of data.  Inference is "just" interpolation or extrapolation using that model.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Can you explain your last paragraph a little more? You're summarizing function of training, and defining inference within a context of LLMs very succinctly --looks very interesting. But I wish to have a little more clarity on this. Maybe explaining 'non-linear regression' and 'general purpose function' would suffice.</div>
