When they say continual learning, do they mean the base model weights are updated during/after deployment (the model literally changes over time), or do they mean a separate memory system that stores and retrieves information without changing the core weights?

If a model like ‘Opus 5.0’ ships in June and later ‘Opus 5.5’ ships in November, what (if anything) gets carried forward?

                                <div class="reply-body">"Appears as continual to users" isn't the relevant bar for AGI questions. 

The most treasured ability for an AGI is a system that improves its own cognition, which then improves it further, etc. This requires something like weight modification or architectural self-modification. If "continual learning" just means "better RAG," the recursion doesn't get off the ground, you're adding information, not capability.

Retrieval lets a model access more information, but it doesn't expand what patterns it can recognize or what reasoning it can perform. A model with perfect retrieval over all of Wikipedia still can't solve problems outside its capability space. True weight updates (potentially) can.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">continual learning means learning new patterns, the reasons arc agi 2 is still not saturated is because the LLMs are not generalised to the point where it can learn all the infinite possible patterns any simple "game"/problem/puzzle could be.

they solve some in a decent amount of actions (which is part of the score) partly because of luck, partly because their training data has helped them on that specific problem.

basically they have a fixed capability space every with memories, even if they were given an infinitely large 100% retrieval context window there are some "games" they'd never figure out without brute forcing or being trained to solve them (which can't be done with every problem).

and for some they take way too long to solve properly.

it doesn't matter how they get there, only the result, it could be via "memories", it could be updated weights, it could be both and it could be neither. as long as you can teach it something new, even if takes twice as long and twice as much teaching material as a human adult to teach them. there are human mathematicians better than current SotA but these humans have spent 1000s of times less time learning maths, seeing 1000s of times less info, arguably we've "seen" some maths as part of evolution but for the most part it's generalised from different skills acquired in evolution and continual learning during life.

personally? I think a move away from text reasoning and more into latent space reasoning, and a latent space memory store, that more closely resembles us. people who don't think with an inner monologue still think, they think in non verbal thoughts (as do people with an inner monologue, they're translating thoughts to text as they think), the idea of throwing a ball contains far more data than "I throw the ball" and in this high data uncompressed latent space I think much more robust AI can emerge and a memory store in this space will be a lot more useful.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You say "it doesn't matter how they get there, only the result." For AGI specifically, It's the opposite.

Consider recursive self-improvement, the Holy Grail when it comes to AGI Capability. There's a massive difference between:

System A: Frozen weights + retrieval + periodic human-supervised retraining cycles

System B: Weights that update autonomously from ongoing experience

System A has humans in the loop at every capability jump. System B is what people actually mean when they worry about (or hope for) systems that "improve themselves."

If 2026-era "continual learning" is mostly System A dressed up in System B language, then:

Timelines for autonomous self-improvement are longer than discourse assumes.

The "fast takeoff" scenario requires architectural breakthroughs we haven't deployed yet.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Continual learning *in practice* means updating weights or other parameters of a model under compute and storage **constraints**. You are also limited by the physical networks. In 2026 this means connected GPUs/TPUs/big chips mostly. If someone, somehow unlocks ~~(invasion)~~ the required resources for example through ocean mining, storage and compute might be less of a problem so you are left with network latency. Only way out I know is bigger chips like Cerebras. That has its own issues. Or stacking obviously. Oh, I forget energy, water for cooling...

Meditation but visual stuffs stays

I am tired..i did meditation for 2 days. Not once i was able to stop visualizing. Guided meditation says "breathe, exhale and inhale" and I see a nose in my visual doinh it while i also focus on breathing.

I visual a lot, study better with visual so.. that's why? When you meditate, its all black hm?

I tried body one, "focus on leg sensation" i visualize leg. What i  do :( what kinda meditation suits me? Mantra? when i speak those words like "Om" it get writen visual.

I terribly need help. 

Oh! i once did musical sound of meditation, imagining of ball up up up and down tin! so i imagined while focusing on that visual video in my head while music goes on (meditation bowl kind).</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Notice the aspects of your experience during meditation which is bringing you peace of mind. For example, it might be the lack of problem solving/trying to ‘fix’ things, the lack of mental rumination, or the lack of self-judgment. 

See if you can slowly bring some of these qualities into your daily life outside of meditation. The aim of meditation is to show you that life doesn’t need to be escaped from, rather it can be engaged with mindfully even if external circumstances are messy or chaotic. </div>

If patients or even techs/nurses were directly imputing patient complaints/symptoms, I don’t think ai will be diagnosing much correctly. 

Now if given mostly relevant details and the extraneous things are removed, then yes ai does a pretty good job already. But that’s not real world.</div>

So for anyone who truly cannot afford $20 a month but still wants access to the most cutting edge AI technology, ads seem like the only solution. Or they could do the Wikipedia thing and flashbang you with that giant banner begging for money every time you open the app.

This is coming from someone with uBlock Origin on my computer and sideloaded YouTube, Reddit, Twitter etc on my phone so I literally never see ads.</div>

&gt;It's also not clear if OpenAI will hide ads if you pay for one of the paid subscriptions, such as Go, Plus, and Pro.

Considering that there's already precedent for paid subscriptions that do show ads, it wouldn't be surprising, at least for the $20 tier.</div>

Especially talking stages or early stages of dating. It stops your brain from doing that mini heart-drop every time your phone buzzes, wondering if it’s them. You’re not flying to your phone to turn it over. If or when things fade out, you’re not associating every text tone with them and flinching at every notification for a week like a ghost might be texting ...</div>

But keep in mind that the reason OAI cared so much about the 6% drop to do a code red was because the web traffic version is capturing the professional users, often the large paying accounts, so 6% there was a big deal. That is why the 5.2 release was more oriented to coders and enterprise users.</div>
