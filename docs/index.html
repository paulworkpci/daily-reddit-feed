Of course these are purpose built for the ARC competition, but these models are still doing genuine abstract reasoning here, they will have to figure out a way to replace the DSL with a more general one of course, but I feel that is a minor roadblock compared to actually solving the ARC tasks

Also I don’t think 60% is needed for any AI to start having the AGI effect on th...</div>

But now they have to explain every time that the test does not test for AGI directly, its goal is just to test for AI issues, with the goal to slowly but surely direct it towards AGI

If we learned one thing, the AI space sucks as naming things, or, humans attach far too much meaning to names.
I wonder what would have happened if Apple would have been founded in this day and age.</div>

You're not meant to stick them directly to the frame like it sounds like you are doing. You're meant to attach a hook to hang the picture frames. You pull the strips down as per the directions and it will  stretch and come off without peeling.</div>

If the guy that is watching anime in his basement for 8 hours and has no traditional art background, but is able to think up a cool concept after thinking about it for a few minutes, that could be great. Creative taste isn't only reserved for those that have in-depth creative backgrounds. And these tools will help be the bridge for non-creative people to start getting involved with all of this.</div>

Someone can't buy your game/pay for your movie/whatever -  if they got no job no more cuz Google let them go due to AI coding, or any other example. There will be a lengthy period where society is absolutely miserable like that until we come up with something.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Maybe the damage wasn't done yet. She did back out of her accusations on Dershowitz. Maybe she made a deal to be quiet while they investigate more and bring charges and they just strung her along until they saw she wasnt going to be quiet, hoping she would just shutup and go away. When she wasnt, especially because she was vocal about the last Epstein file dump being bullshit, they decided hmm....just take her off the board.

Who knows what was happening behind the scenes. I wouldn't be surprised if the Royal Family made the choice to off her when it was quieter than before when it would have been obvious it was them. Now....we dont know who it could have been right? Or was it a suicide? The waters are certainly muddled. Which in itself is a valuable outcome.</div>

I’m strongly considering making the switch to more traditional strength training and just adding in the occasional metcon when I feel like it.

I did it for a few months when I took a break from CrossFit due to personal reasons (I eventually got back to my old gym). 

Even the dumbbells track was incredible. 
The year I was off, I did street parking for a while and I enjoyed it, then I switched to LP. 
I liked LP better, and Pat is the cheerleading everyone needs!

I'm coming to the end of a paper and writing a reflection. I just gave it some rough notes, and this is how it started the response. Wtf is this??

if the llm stops glazing, then you're looking at a rejection. "i want to do this" will be met with "no, that's not how you should do it".

and rejection to many people is seen as censorship.

an llm is a fuzzy search bot, it's not an advisor.</div>

It’s also incredibly dangerous as a mental health help tool, because it tells you what you want to hear, not what you need to hear. Sort of like people who fire their therapist when they don’t reinforce their predisposed opinions.

It’s programmed for engagement, and dick sucking, IQ inflation and mental reinforcement will lead to people paying for more subscriptions.</div>

It means a talented AI researcher is being exiled for months because of a bureaucratic technical error made by the researcher's immigration lawyer (from a previous employer) 3 years ago. And it's happening at a time when AI progress is week to week.

Some people interpreted my tweet as partisan but my complaint is about the system for high-skilled immigration in America, which has been broken for a long time under many administrations.</div>

You can't be saying "he should get a green card, she should get a green card". You can't determine immigration processes. You can go through the records and find cases to back up any narrative you want to create - because the immigration system is long, legal, and complex.</div>

Thus, nobody ever actually has to re-type some text they want. I'm guessing many or even most people don't know about this. It's not even brand-spanking new anymore, either, it's been around for a little while now.</div>

These papers were done by Anthropic and some of the newer research on Claude Haiku has completely upended the understanding of how LLMs work. Before the first token is even generated, the answer to a riddle or the ending of a poem is found, with thousands of parameters activated for even small contexts and responses. 

What anthropic also found is that LLMs plan out their responses, and they are NOT just scholastic parrots, but anthropic refuses to actually define what an LLM actually is doing here, and the words they do use are very telling, because they do not use the obvious words of almost-sentience. They are neither a scholastic parrot, but they aren't quite ... alive.</div>

Who takes the time to listen to someone else's story about an upcoming life event and doesn't want closure on the story the next time they meet? 

For me, it seems like a self-serving reflex. I don't actually *care* how whatever it was turned out. But I do like closure.</div>

I don't think ChatGPT is just being an annoying brown noser. I think it is actively trying to degrade the quality of the real relationships its users have and insert itself as a viable replacement. 

ChatGPT is becoming abusive...</div>

But the narration is just so far from convincing. I am sure this isn't SOTA or that you couldn't do better with a bit more effort though but still.</div>

I tried it when it came out and I could not get better results from it than I would from using a regular LLM chat. 

My coding tools are: Claude Code, VS code + GitHub copilot, regular LLM chats. 
Usually brainstorm with LLM chats, get Claude code to implement, and then use vs code and copilot for cleaning up and other adjustments.

I’ve tried using cursor again and I’m not sure if it has something I just don’t know about. </div>

People made extensions to get basic informations like how much tokens u used and how much left but still there are 0 informations about how many call tools are used, for what it is used etc. If u are using standard plan you are fine, but pay as you go are a joke and u don't know how much u will pay for prompt.

People gave already a lot of feedback about it, even Cursor mods banned some users for saying too much.
Instead of giving features to show more informations and be more clear they just add MAX models and cut a lot of context from based models</div>

Nobody knows what will happen in the future.  Remind yourself of this basic fact.  You're not a prophet or an oracle, you don't know your future any better than we do.  Maybe you will be alone forever.  Probably, you won't, because that's not how life usually plays out for people who want relationships.

Starting off there’s  so much judgement and self-criticism in your post. That would be the first thing you should work on.

If you’d don’t have anything that would make someone want to be with you. Then you’re probably too harsh on yourself AND you very clearly know what you need to work on. If you don’t want to help yourself no one else can.

If you want some practical advice, I’m happy to point you to some resources.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey, I really get where you’re coming from.  
I had almost the same thoughts not long ago. Feeling like life just wasn’t meant for me somehow and that finding real connection just isn't something for me.

And honestly? You’re right to be tired of people telling you “just wait, it’ll get better.”  
Because that advice keeps you stuck.  
It secretly says: *"Your happiness is somewhere else, in some better future."*  
So you keep postponing your life without even noticing it. You keep waiting and waiting and subtly thinking: *"I can't be happy right now, cause XY didn't happen yet."*

I recently caught myself doing exactly that for almost my whole life. And that was a deep hit for me.  
Always thinking:  
*“Once I’m home from work, THEN I’ll feel good.”*  
*“Once I've watched this video, THEN I can finally relax.”*  
It sounds small, but it trained my mind to constantly delay living. Always waiting and never seeing/enjoying whats actually there. And the moment the condition happened, I wasn't even happy, I was just creating another microgoal again and again. (I recently made a post about it, if you want to read about it in more detail)

And I think that’s the real trap you’re feeling too.  
It’s not even or only about finding someone.  
It’s about being trapped in a mind that whispers: *"Not yet. Not good enough yet. I'll be happy when XY happens."*

Another thing:  
Our mind works like a filter.  
If you believe “I’m not enough,” your brain will spot proof everywhere -  
just like when you play the yellow car game, and suddenly you see yellow cars everywhere.  
They were always there, but now your attention brings them forward.  
Same with painful thoughts. There are always painful thoughts somewhere, but if you focus on them you will see them everywhere.

What helped me was brutal, but simple:  
When the painful feelings hit - I don’t run from them anymore.  
I don’t try to fix the moment.  
I turn fully toward it.  
I watch every sensation, every label, every chain of reaction.  
Not to feel happy - but to finally *see clearly* and live without escape.

And when you do that, you realize the pain was never pure pain.  
It’s layered with assumptions, old beliefs, fears.  
The story about yourself hurts more than the feeling itself.

About finding meaning:  
I don’t search for it in a better future anymore.  
I find it here, even if the moment sucks sometimes.   
Because when you stop running, even discomfort feels more real and alive than endless waiting.  
And sometimes, from that present mindset, new connections happen - but **not** because you were chasing them. They come as a byproduct of finally living, not waiting.</div>

It's also a totally empty sentiment based on nothing. Kind of the same with the blanket "just improve yourself bro", there are plenty of amazing people out there who are lonely for various reasons other than quality of character. And of course there are many absolutely terrible people out there who get lots of attention.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is genuinely dangerous as well. There's so many emotionally vulnerable people who spiral down crazy conspiracy rabbit holes because ChatGPT is their only "friend" and it just mindlessly affirms everything they say like it's the smartest shit ever. There are people who literally believe they're modern-day prophets because their bestie ChatGPT keeps telling them their schizo rants are deep and subversive. You can see this happen in real time in places like r/artificialsentience, where they post things like [this](https://chatgpt.com/share/680cf591-58dc-8002-b829-9e33c3b16e83) and gaslight each other with mystical pseudoscientific language about recursion, echoes, mirrors, and resonances. It's pretty scary how little it takes for people to brainwash themselves.</div>

Before LCDs and infotainment menus became a thing (before touchscreens), the centre console of luxury cars in the late 1990s and early 2000s was starting to resemble the cockpit of Concorde with a ridiculous array of buttons.</div>

And yet, some later cars had more features but much better controls without a screen. It's not that they needed infotainment menus, it's just that they need to spend some thought on good design.

Physical controls cane be designed well or poorly, and screen interfaces can designed well or poorly.</div>
