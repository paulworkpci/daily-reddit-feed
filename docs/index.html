Second, I’ve used it for medical stuff too. My son has a heart condition that will eventually require surgery one day. I uploaded his echo results and got an analysis, and surgical options (some of which I wasn’t even aware of) and it helped me go through his symptoms, areas for concern, etc. 

Even though I’m a nurse, sometimes it makes it harder with family. Hard to be subjective. I’ll either downplay things or catastrophize. It’s hard to find the sweet spot. It was immensely helpful, more so than anything I’ve had at his cardiology appointments, and he’s got great doctors.</div>

I used to cook easy stuff for a long time, then I got an air fryer and it gave me all kinds of marinades and recipes to try, and even how to prepare everything and cooking times.  Rather than grabbing fast food, I'm now cooking almost every meal and meal prepping on the weekends, and eating a lot healthier too and cooking stuff I probably never would have before. 

Plus, it really makes it easy and fun to try new stuff, and making a shopping list of seasonings and supplies.  Not to sound corny, but it's changing my life in a good way.</div>

Hope they go on to do amazing things with a larger budget at hand now. I really liked what they did with their roadtrips, even with a limited budget.

I hope that Amazon allows them to continue doing that in their style. It'll be a rejuvenation of the top gear days with both roadtrips and adventures as well as new car reveals and reviews. Can't wait!</div>

Even Chris Harris had some notoriety as a journalist before breaking out to YT, then into Top Gear. 

Proud of the lads from starting their work from Toronto/GTA, and basically pulling off the dream.

I wonder if the long trip videos they did recently had somewhat of an intention to catch the eyes of Amazon/BBC for Top Gear/TGT successors</div>

Every single enthusiast has been calling their videos the second incarnation of grand tour/top gear for a long time now. They have a great chemistry together and have a wonderful way of presenting the cars while incorporating fun and personality into the videos. Hope they go on to do great things in the show!

I hope Amazon gives them the freedom to do their own thing instead of trying to replicate what GT/TG were. They have their own great style of presentation and plenty of experience to boot. I'm sure they'll do great with it on the show.</div>

                <div class="post-content">No secret that Hyrox is the hot new fitness competition that everyone in the fitness world is gravitating towards. Even big name crossfit athletes like Tia and Fraser have entered in Hyrox races. 

I think what Hyrox does great is making the race/competition accessible to a wider range of gym goers. Kind of like the NY or Boston Marathon. Your everyday local runner can qualify for the race with a decent baseline time BUT also the top tier Olympic level marathon runners also race in the NY Marath...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">1) What Hyrox does well aside of the media, is combining easy movements into a fun competition that is easy to follow. Everyone can do a wall-ball, there is no need to invent the handstand push-up leg snatch to create a new challenge every year. 

2) On another note, i am not even certain its Hyrox being great or CrossFit just being a disgrace to its former values and respect to the athletes to an extent, that any competitor would perform well against what remains of CrossFit. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed, CrossFit, especially the games, has lost its way. The amount of idiotic movements and weird test items over the last few years have been really dumb and have absolutely nothing to do with functional movement in life.

The walking, unsupported hand stand pushups are a particularly good example of having lost the plot.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You kind of have a point but taking wall-balls as an example of something everyone can do is pretty ironic.

That's the one movement that is notoriously not easy for beginners and often a shitshow even for advanced hyrox racers.

In all my years of coaching the amount of people who could do wallballs **to standard** on day 1 of training (with the rx weight) is close to zero. If we're looking only at people with no prior fitness experience it's undoubtably very much 0.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I respectfully disagree that they are wildly different. Hyrox movements all exist in CrossFit. But all of CrossFit’s movements don’t exist in Hyrox. 

Hyrox is Ski, Sled, Burpee, Rowing, Farmers Carry,Sandbag Lunges, Wall Balls and Running. 

I would say that many people have adopted Hyrox as its more inclusive by movement and will breed people to look for more complex workouts like CrossFit. It’s a great progression and should be embraced. 

Plus, box owners can use their current equipment to get new members and increase revenue to keep everything going.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean I see what you're saying, but your analogy is bogus. Define "ball". There's literally hundreds of different things we would refer to as a "ball" that are wildly different from one another. Football and baseball do not remotely use the same implements for game play. Hence why we call it a "baseball" and a "football" respectively. 

The implements used in Hyrox are literally identical to the implements used in Crossfit. The movements are literally identical. That doest mean they're the same sport, but you need to work harder to that point lol.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed. I didn't start pursuing CrossFit because I wanted to compete in the games - I didn't even know about them and it was the furthest thing from my mind. I like CrossFit because it's making me so much healthier and the community is so nice, plus love of the barbell. The idea of doing a fitness race that has nothing to do with the barbell has zero appeal. I compete against myself every day and that's what matters. I'm glad people enjoy hyrox but whatever they're getting out of it has nothing to do with the reasons CrossFit appeals to me and many others like me.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">100% agree.  Hyrox to me will probably take business from races like Spartan or Tough Mudder, but if anything it's complimentary to Crossfit.

Hyrox is a race first.  Crossfit is a methodology first.  That is the key difference.

I think that Hyrox is perfectly positioned to scoop up a lot of crossfitters into a competition here and there, and will interest many crossfitters who've never participated in a crossfit comp or who have only done the open.  That's because it's dramatically more approachable than a crossfit competition.  In fact, my gym is having an internal Hyrox competition in early June and it's attracted a ton of interest.

I do not think it will attract the same level of interest for spectators because crossfit's "unknown and unknowable" element made it fun to watch, and made it lean toward the elite.</div>

You can always throw away the branch and revert back to main/master if needed.  Let git be your checkpointing system. I realize this isn't the answer you're looking for but claude code is pretty accurate and revert is decently fast.

You could just keep cursor or windsurf around for some edits with a cheaper model. When it fails, then use Claude Code. It will cost you an extra $15-20 a month but that's not horrible.</div>

The fact that it has grown so large and so quickly indicates that the greater population is actually starting to ask these same questions, that this thing is not fringe.

But we also have the usual, "the world is terrible, billionaires will turn us to food, and shoot us with robots rather than do next to nothing to give the rest of the world a decent life" mentality that is endemic to the zeitgeist.</div>

I know (personally) a number of people on the Anthropic team and they are not trying to sell people something by causing fear/exaggeration. They truly believe this is true. 

Think of it this way, what exactly would you expect a “real” warning to look like? Who does it come from? How is that person knowledgable enough for you to believe and yet somehow not employed with one of the major players right now? Don’t discount everything just so you can feel “smart” for a brief moment in a Reddit comment.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That argument is so bizarre to me.

You don't see Fossil fuel companies say "We're extremely dangerous and destroying the ecology, we should be taxed more", Nuclear companies say "We could cause new chernobyls in the future we should be taxed more" or Biotech companies claim "We could leak new viruses and cause pandemics we should be taxed more".

That would be an absolutely *insane* thing for these companies to claim even though it's all technically true. Yet somehow when AI companies do exactly that people somehow think it's a PR/Marketing strategy?????

How delusional are these people? This is a genuine concern and everyone should heed this.</div>

Many Redditors claim that, without ChatGPT, nobody would use the "*em dash*" because there's no dedicated "*em dash*" key on keyboards.

Anyone who's ever worked with HTML knows that, when using HTML or markdown&amp;mdash;which Reddit does&amp;mdash;knows how to use *HTML entities*. 

The HTML entity for the "*em dash*" 
is `&amp;mdash;`.

Edit: guys I’m well aware there’s multiple ways to tell, em dashes are the easiest way to tell right now and that will probably change in the future.</div>

It's because the training data cutoff date hasn't caught up to the date people caught onto the em dash en masse.

Once a year or two goes by, it will naturally fall away in the tuning and outputs once the LLMs understand why people don't like it. And when you say "sound less like an AI," that will implicitly include no em dashes because it will understand the association.</div>

This ego stuff is confusing lol. There's the relationship with ego in Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, etc and they all differ! Im working on my self worth and desire for external validation. I tell myself from time to time that im pretty, beautiful, gorgeous, whatever, and I believe it. Is that...bad? Does saying those things cultivate an unhealthy ego?

I don't think it's healthy when some people here are hellbent on "killing the ego", not even sure it's possible.


You can be enlightened or whatever, but your personality traits still would remain, it's just that, you wouldn't identify yourself with your ego, just step out the way and let the body and mind do as they will, according to your nature. Or so I heard, I'm not enlightened, not even sure I want to chase that ideal anymore.</div>

The ego is not bad in and of itself, it can be a tool, just like your body or your mind even though you are not your body, or your mind, or you limited identity (ego).

But if you want to be brutally honest with yourself and someday you will, you'll have to accept that before you were anything you were nothing, and you still are. Total dissolution. And that's a great thing because it allows you to redefine yourself to be anything you want, the burdens of the past don't have to be a drag, you can burn yourself and rise again a fresh new life like the phoenix.

That which you were in the womb before you knew any labels, that's your purest being. Pure awareness.</div>

**The Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) is a self-improving AI system that iteratively modifies its Python codebase, empirically validating—instead of formally proving—its coding agent capabilities on SWE-bench/Polyglot using frozen foundation models. Its Darwinian open-ended exploration maintains an agent archive, selecting parent agents via performance and fewer existing children (for novelty) for self-modification; these parents analyze their own benchmark logs to propose codebase changes, improving internal tools (e.g., granular file viewing/editing, string replacement) and workflows (e.g., multi-attempt solutions, history-aware patch generation). DGM demonstrably improved performance from 20.0% to 50.0% (SWE-bench) and 14.2% to 30.7% (Polyglot), surpassing non-self-improving/non-open-ended baselines, with discovered features generalizing across FMs/languages under sandboxed, human-overseen conditions. By empirically validating its own evolving code modifications drawn from an inter-generational archive, DGM demonstrates a practical path toward open-ended, recursively self-advancing AI systems.**</div>
