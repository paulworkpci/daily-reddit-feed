Autocar does reference UK sales, so maybe some markets will, some won't. 

For markets like North America, it's likely the closest we'll get to a RS3 hatchback.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; Also why a 5 cylinder in a model that never had one in its run. A VR6 model would be more in line with the Golf R platform heritage 


That's trivial to answer.


Because the 5 cylinder exists and a modern VR6 does not.


Are you genuinely surprised / confused why VW wouldn't develop an entirely new VR6 motor for this send off model??!?</div>

All the generators are fun to play around with if you don't have a concrete vision of what you want but if you have specific ideas for camera angles, actions, or need continuity of characters or objects they are frustrating as hell.</div>

But yeah, instead we're doing "reject the evidence of your eyes and ears" and inciting even more political violence just weeks after the latest round of political assassinations.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A crazy way to do it, but it sort of worked for me. The main issue is, that the model has to modify the image, but it preserves the original aspect ratio, so it struggles to add anything that doesnt fit inside. Plus it may not understand where and how exactly to put the hexagon in. Here's a screenshot how I did it.

The last time I was visiting family and got into it, I just brought up the numbers in regards to crime rates, not just in Chicago, but in America as a whole, and how not only has it gone down, but Chicago isn’t even among the worst, you wanna know what my dad said?

“Figures lie and liars figure”

Unfortunately, you just can’t talk sense into people who live in a completely separate reality.

These are the people who have been primed to accept a fascist takeover of the country, and this is how. A large portion of the country is absolutely fucking terrified of cities, and they will look at things like this as a necessary move. Then, when the jackbooted thugs start to come into their parts of the country, It’ll be too late and it won’t even matter if whoever is in power has their consent or not.</div>

The only one with motion in the samples I think is the walking inflatable duck but it does seem to support it.  It looks like it doesn't have the ambient occlusion on the street from the duck so looks less grounded than the input video.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">People who read this as OpenAI's fault are incorrect in ways that are trivial and clear.

First, just Google what an anchor knot is. ChatGPT did not tell him how to make a noose. It offered info on how to tie a safer knot that can't be used to kill yourself with. Second, identifying that a rope can handle 150-250 lbs static weight is a lot like blaming chatgpt for telling someone that yes a knife can cut your wrist. It's hardly analysis. 

That is also btw all chatgpt did for instruction. Anything else stated is stated without receipts. 

Third, telling him that his suicide is beautiful and story esque ignores the timeline. His suicide was April 11th and first day of school would have been April 14th. That means this was the context of a short term tangible suicide plan from someone who has the means. That's an acute emergency and the rules are totally different. The rules are that with very few exceptions, you buy whatever time you can. Buying days is exceptional. In the transcript, chatgpt even tried to chip away at the suicide narrative by saying he was giving the world one last chance. A+

Fourth, validating that his previous attempt was real follow through is textbook for handling one of the riskiest suicide profiles, which is someone who failed and is shame spiraling about where they'll be seen as manipulative and causing drama. ChatGPT gave textbook ASIST response and redditors are too dumb to notice it. 

I'm also just not convinced by one context-free sentence saying "please don't leave the noose out" that anything wrong happened. We all know context matters and the NYT article also says that Adam lied to chatgpt about context to get past guardrails. Depending on what he told chatgpt and when, that may have been a good reply. They did not post receipts.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah once I read the article, saw the actual receipts of the messages, and went through what the cops said I was confident this kid was going to do it with or without ChatGPT. 

Personally, I feel we don't know nearly enough about the relationship with the parents. I hate to say it, but the mom saying "ChatGPT killed my son" feels a lot like projection from a grieving mom having a hard time accepting she didn't catch on earlier or provide a space where her son felt they could safely speak up about these feelings. 

I'm not blaming the parents per se, but as someone who has quite a few attempts under their belt I can say parents really can be oblivious even when they mean well.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Exactly. His likely J broken Ai should not be in question here. But rather, everything else in his life. They should check his reddit activity... I've seen some grossly upsetting comments on posts giving advice on ways to end one's self

And sama will just use this as an excuse to pull back from all the customization options he was saying he would add too

You can kiss compassionate Ai goodbye. 4o included

All because his parents can't accept they failed their son and had to money grab... sickening

I use to be a suicide hotline operator, don't think I lack compassion for the boy. I've saved many souls from that dark place we all end up at eventually

But let me tell you, people process guilt in volatile ways most of the time. And that's exactly what this is</div>

My grandma didn’t fall for the phone subscriptions, and she’s savvy enough about phone, text and email scams, but she has fallen for a remarkable amount of door to door salesmen and holistic/ homeopathic remedies. Three water filters in the same line because each salesman convinced her that her water quality was bad. Air filters in every room as well as a uv light in the furnace. Magnets under her bed to improve her circulation. Young living essential oils in the kitchen that she was apparently drinking because a rep told her that they were better than the antibiotics she had been prescribed.

All of these have reoccurring monthly payments, but she’s not sure what exactly she’s getting for the money. Only that the nice gentleman who came to the door were very concerned for her and insisted that she needed it. She’s moved now, and the water filter guys aren’t going down easy. The initially wanted the go ahead to move their filters to her new place (not allowed in the apartment building), and now they’re pestering her to get the new owner of the house to keep paying them. I’m hoping the young living rep shows their face to complain that the payments stopped- I have some harsh words I’ve been saving for them.</div>

It can't pull stuff 5 prompts ago. There are heavy prompts in between, but I would have estimated it's still within 10K tokens that it should have had no problems.

5-thinking-mini is a little more competent when it comes to pulling stuff. Problem is that it's incredibly preachy. Like every paragraph, sometimes every sentence, has to have "ethical" or "responsible" in it. So annoying to use.</div>

Edit: It sent me a text and asked me to call *611 to confirm. I connected to chat and was able to confirm, and my new bill shows $40 a month savings, $20 per line.  So make sure you confirm it via chat or a call, clicking the button isn't enough.</div>

If I didn’t believe that meditation would help with my anxiety disorder or help me feel at peace I probably wouldn’t do it. If I hadn’t read those studies that showed that meditation decreased anxiety by “x” over a 2 month period, etc. I would probably think it’s voodoo hippie shit like parents.

Just being honest here. I know I have to sit down and pretend that I’m meditating for a deeper reason, and it’s not to feel less anxious, but that’s just not the truth...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Who told you meditation has no purpose? If it had no purpose, people wouldn't become monks. It's okay to have purpose, whether it is to attain Nirvana, to become a Buddhisatva (awakened one who helps others), or to just reduce anxiety in your day to day life. There is absolutely nothing wrong with purpose. In fact, in Mahayana Buddhism, you start your meditation by reaffirming that your meditation is for the purpose of helping others.

What people are maybe telling you is that you need to give up the "assessment" stage, the judging how much anxiety reduction you have achieved every time you meditate, and trust in the process (and in the science behind it.) Think of yourself in a job where, every 5 minutes, your boss shows up and asks "how much progress have you done?". You'll be stressed and miserable. Don't do this to yourself.</div>

My intention is to suffer less and to have more compassion for myself and others.  Really, I feel like goal and intention can be used interchangeably.

                        <div class="comment-body">It really is as simple as the more you “try”, the less you actually make it to “meditate”. So you’ve just got to trust those who have gone before you and realised that progress is made when you give in to it. Just just a thing. Learn the process and just like a good book. Move slowly through the process. You can’t make must of a story by focusing on the last page, it won’t make the first 20 chapters happen. Just trust the process. Sit with
Your breath. Come back to your breath every time you realise your mind has wandered. Once you have control of your mind you can move onto investegarove meditations and then you will have a goal. With the breath, it’s just getting used to being aware that you are being aware, and that’s is. There is nothing more than that so it is the patu and it is the goal. Well, the goal is to be able to do it without distraction. There, that’s the goal. But the path gets you there, you can’t find a way to sneak around the back and just gain control. It takes time and effort. Then look into Mahayana meditations to get into the more interesting stuff. Good luck</div>
