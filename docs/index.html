I have always wanted to try CrossFit as it reminds me a lot of the camaraderie of when you’d work out in sports teams together. 

I’m looking for any success stories on improved mental health from CrossFit and how that first class went. 

I’m signed up for a class tonight and feeling nervous for it

No one will be negative.  Most people will be positive.  Some people might be in their own heads and just not out going.  

I didn't struggle the first time b/c I didn't know what crossfit was and thought I was just checking out a kick boxing gym.  My whole world changed.  You wont regret it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">the exception being controlled substances- like oxycodones, adhd meds etc. while the insurance may cover it a few days early, most pharmacists will not refill it until 2 days before the due date *at most.*

if you fill 3 month supplies of your maintenance meds, you can likely refill a week or two sooner. most insurances follow a 75% threshold- so once 75% of your recent fill has been used (assuming you've taken it every day since the fill date for the correct dosage), you can refill it again.

My husband is on the same one at a bit higher dosage. So he has a built-in buffer of being able to take mine if he runs out for any reason.

Now, normally I would never let someone else take my meds, but it's literally exactly the same so I wouldn't hesitate.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There's a conceptual thing here that people really need to grasp. You also see lots of stories about lead content of baby food. 

Food is grown in the ground, there is lead in the ground, it is absorbed by the food. 

If you take that food and puree it, dehydrate it, the result also contains lead.

If you take that food and **concentrate it** you are concentrating the bad parts alongside the good parts. 

You should basically know something isn't good for you when its a "cheat." You can't cheat nutrition, you can't get all of your vegetables in a drink without *some* catch.</div>

Thoughts seem vague and poorly defined to most people. Part of learning mindfulness is to increase clarity (sati sampajañña in Pali). We readily understand that body sensations have spatial locations, including emotional feelings in the body. But when you examine thoughts, you realize that we experience them in two predominant forms: mental images and me...</div>

I’m going to take your advice and be mindful of these specific locations &amp; see how it flows.

You have any advice on how not to latch on to thoughts, when the thought doesn’t suit the moment?</div>

But when you just focus on the location in space, you just watch them appear and disappear in that space, like a slide show. You can view the images like through a blurry lens and the talk like through a broken speaker. So you're not avoiding or suppressing them, but not focused on the content either.</div>

Recently I got into solo game development, and i’ve been mostly vibe coding it from scratch. Initially it was just an idea to test out, but after multiple rounds of game testing with diverse groups of gamers, game designers, and taking game writing courses, I think the game can actually be promising. So I’m more committed to it. 

The game already has pretty complex logic, in te...</div>

And you said it yourself, you don't understand the systems, there are bugs, this is what you should do now :

  
Since most of the systems you built into the game are "spaghetti" and some have bugs, why not workout the bugs, but the process of working out the bugs and quirks, rewrite the sections that are causing bugs/issues, and then everytime you implement or add a feature you can also fix something else, whats that? you only get 35 fps in that specific area? maybe its time to rewrite a bunch of the jumbled code for that area and properly optimize it and document it internally and professionally.

  
experimental &gt; prototype &gt; flushing systems to ensure they work &gt; bug fixing &gt; slowly but surely updating, optimizing the code and structure of the code and the files within the project, proper documentation, but don't do it all at once you will either burn yourself out or come out of with more hard baked and cooked features than before.

This is only my opinion. Take it with a gain of salt but this how i would handle your situation :)</div>

Isn't the core ethos of "vibe" to dump it and start again? 

You can certainly get the AI to document the main features, then re-think the grand structure more pro foundly, rhen re-build with thst "lens" using the code you have. 

I heard that startups have to re-write their entire codebase several times. 

Its wrong to start out too wide, and hard to grow something narrow. 

Complex issue. Try to use AI to solve it. I'm "working on" ways to get it to architect smarter.</div>

It’s a tough decision to rewrite to rework in your position.

For what it’s worth, you could have gotten here without vibe coding too. Even devs will move fast and above their understanding often and end up in this situation.

It might be a good time for a “spike”. A test. Take a day and try your refactor and see how it goes. Then reevaluate.

Edit: I definitely like the mention of having the AI do analysis for any refactor. You might have it analyze the code, guide it towards your problem areas maybe then have it work out a plan to refactor to better systems piece by piece.

Given a sufficiently large codebase and human devs that’s a common strategy, historically.</div>

Truck sizes were perfect in 2000. It's gotten so out of control and I don't know why you would even want to drive one of those enormous things. Isn't it a pain in the ass? Feel like you'll need to get a separate driver's license for them if they get much bigger.</div>

2025 F150 Super Crew: 232" long by 79.9" wide.

Idk. Doesn't seem like the footprint is that much bigger over 25 years. The civic grew 9" in length versus 6" in the F150.

I have an F150 and to answer your question they are generally not a pain in the ass to drive. I'm 6'4" and find it extremely comfortable just as a place to be. The size is only noticeable in a negative way in parking lots with super narrow lines, but when you consider a 4runner is only two inches narrower, that small spot would be a pain in many vehicles.

I completely agree with you that they do look enormous. Maybe the styling works to add some sort of aggressiveness that makes them look like they've grown a ton? I'm not sure.

Honestly, they wouldn't be as popular as they are if they weren't really good vehicles. It's nice I can use mine for work and still enjoy it as a DD instead of having a work truck and a separate car for normal life.</div>

However, the absolute dominance of full-size trucks in US driveways could be on the decline.

I am still kicking myself for not getting the life time deal :(

 I am at 1017 aliases and I use it everywhere I possibly can even on government websites

I bought a custom domain from namecheap and so far about 6 aliases have been caught in data breaches

I subbed my domain to HaveIbeenpwned too

I use Bitwarden as my Password manager and 30 characters randomly generated everywhere I can

The password to the vault itself is a long passphrase 

My Yubikeys are used for 2FA ESPECIALLY my 2 proton email accounts, Bitwarden, Simplelogin, ID.me and everywhere else

I always look to disable less secure methods so my Yubikeys are the only 2FA and I do not use my phone # as recovery to my email accounts because of sim swapping

I run weekly backups with Cryptomator and Veracrypt on a USB and have an emergency sheet

I am also on point with my internet security and try to keep up with all the methods bad actors use like the recent Clickfix method

This is why I setup an RSS feed to popular cybersecurity newsfeeds

Also on the email compromise

You just have to keep it secure and practice good internet security

Infostealers are the most prevalent threats right now like with Clickfix</div>

You can ask any question on twitter and Logan Kilpatrick either responds himself or he will tag a team member who is responsible to give an answer. I haven't seen this much transparent engagement with community from any other company. Yes, OpenAI does reddit Q&amp;A once in a blue moon but you can never ever get a straight forward answer from anyone working at OpenAI.</div>

\- Gemini doesn't allow you to set a default gem, choose a model for gems on mobile, delete threads if you're a workspace user

\- ChatGPT doesn't allow you to pin threads or easily select a model for threads in projects

\- Claude has weird, opaque rate limits based on token count

I mean small UX lifts here and there would probably have as much an impact on user growth as slight jumps in model performance</div>

Honestly, this does not surprise me. Most Redditors are too condescending, aggressive and rude to change people's minds. It is much harder to change someone's mind if you talk to them like they are a stupid toddler who knows nothing.

LLMs tend to provide evidence-based assertions (even if based on shaky evidence) and *acknowledge* the reasons it may seem otherwise, without being condescending.

The article also says the LLMs pursued user profiles to tailor responses to them. That's something most humans do not have time for but an AI can do quickly. So it could, for example, see that you supported x policy or y legislation, find some similarities, and point those out.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Most AI agents are evaluated on narrow tasks that don’t capture the complexity of real-world challenges like drug discovery.

Deep Origin created the DO Challenge to test that with a new benchmark designed to test autonomous agentic systems in a resource-constrained, simulated drug discovery environment.

They then put their own agentic system, Deep Thought, to the test — comparing its performance against human teams. 

Interesting results!

I've tried for many years to learn programming, learn games engines like unity and unreal. I never went farther than tutorials, not even to completion.

It’s taking a couple of minutes to produce a response to my first question, but it’s got this cool feature where it shows me the way it improved my question. 

I love the idea of running to a scholarly article bot instead of google scholar. I went to a lecture at a medical conference once where the speaker claimed that less than 1% of searches ever click past the first page of results. I wonder if bots like this can help us get past that weird little human quirk.</div>

It's not a weird little human quirk where people are just arbitrarily only reading the first page. Most searches are sorted by relevance, the deeper into the results you go, the less relevant the results are. If you've read through half the first page of results and the second half is basically irrelevant to your query (often the case), then there's really little reason to comb through the next page since the probability of it containing something useful is very low.</div>

Soon I will need to either self-host a massive model that won't even compete well with o3 anyways, or, accept that my results are possibly due to some pharma company paying for a partnership that gives the LLM perverse incentives.</div>
