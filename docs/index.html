Step 1: When I first started, I'd close my eyes and only focused on the black in my vision, when my mind wanders off bring it back and focus on the black again.

Step 2: Over time this became automatic. Now I can just "tense" the front of my brain and the thoughts switch off. I do this every night to help me sleep since I've had t...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">yes. problem is not with thoughts, but the identification with the thoughts as if they are not products of surrounding influences. think of babies before they learn to repeat the language of their surroundings. some get so caught up in language constructs that they believe to be these language constructs. they allow words to manipulate/control their behaviors due to identifying so much with thoughts/words/illusions/delusions. being able to turn off your thoughts makes it easier for you to fully appreciate the present moment in natural reality despite the mind's assumptions/projections/illusions/delusions. wish you the best.</div>

The below isnt a criticism, people learn different things from mediation that's part of the fun.

I came to a different conclusion. I realised that thoughts are inevitable. I can no more stop thoughts, then I can stop the tide or prevent the sun from setting. 

However, the important things I noted were:
 - thoughts are not automatically true
 - a lot of mental noise, is just that noise. Nothing to worry about or action. 
 -  that engaging with thoughts is optional 
 - learning how to let go is a severely underrated life skill.</div>

I moved a radio station. And I can absolutely vouch for finding stuff you wouldn't expect. Nothing weird or gross. But just a lot of stuff that makes you scratch your head. 

Under the stairs we had storage closets nobody knew about. And inside foam coolers were reel-to-reel tapes from the 1940s.  Too old to just throw out. But what, are we supposed to put 1940s crap on the air?

It felt great to tag and dispose of crappy CD recorders, MiniDisc recorders, broken cassette and cart machines, etc.  Went all digital, baby!</div>

Soooo I created a tiny deck with index cards to rotate through on a weekly basis! I set a timer, do the task, and send it to the back of the deck. Some items have 2 cards for, ex, twice a week cleans.

If I get through everything by the end of the week, I get to grab a latte from my favorite café, so it's a fun little game!

                        <div class="comment-body">I just watched Candace Owens video and when she said *nobody is taking Charlie’s seat* - I believe she was talking about Ben? Because I could’ve swore I just recently seen something about him saying he’s “picking up the bloody mike and carrying on Charlie’s work”. Someone correct me if it wasn’t Ben who said that about taking over Charlie’s seat but I’m quite certain it was him. 

In Candace’s video I definitely felt some of her words were directed right at Ben. I’m so happy to see people beginning to remove their blind folds, truly genuinely excited to see this all unravel and people not being fooled anymore. I’ve said it once, twice, three times and I’ll say it a million more - choose the center, not a side. The Truth is being revealed and we can prevail.</div>

You can listen to anthropic interview.
They have zero interest into reducing teams because they want to ship faster everyday.
So if a dev + an agent = 2x dev, they will keep hiring to gain even more velocity.

I know what he means, in what I do ''research'' capabilities of all models before GPT-5 Thinking were at best maybe at high functioning 13 year old's school report level. Maybe that is why laymen found previous models more accessible, because they were, they were able to offer you sort of a simplified view on a subject, if they did not hallucinate too. So I tried to ''reasearch'' some topics using them, it cam out with 13 year old's report in one case and with major hallucination in second attempt and I just smiled and said ''yeah, deep thinking my ass''...

Now it is still not perfect so that it would replace me, but it is a true ''copilot''. Model hallucinates so rarely that you do not see it as a major pain in the ass and it can find novel information for you. Yes, it misses things I would find but I also miss stuff it finds, so in that sense this collaboration is useful. We are at the phase where horses who know how to drive tractors replace horses that do not drive tractors... or maybe they do not replace much, just make the job more productive so company owners can buy horses these tractors they need and bring revenue to OpenAI. If me and my colleague had same skills and I used GPT-5 Thinking and he not, if the boss needed a quality report on some topic in a few hours, at the end my report would be way more thorough than his... But that does not mean boss can fire me, not yet...

So while chatbot use really has reached near saturation and I can see people being frustrated with progress... because I think you really need AGI to qualitatively improve that, or some model that is good at empathy and communicating with people and encouraging them and praising etc. At the same time in area of REAL WORK it has moved in my eyes from constant battling of hallucinations and low value research to way way less babysitting and actual value coming out of it.</div>

I was born in Lithuania and moved to the states when I was a teenager. 

Regardless of how you feel about it or whatever illusions you may have, any Eastern/Northern European country that says it wants to keep it’s culture is basically saying that it wants to remain homogenized.

I’m not saying it’s right but you’re looking at it from an American mindset with a very, very different cultural background.</div>

China is not a single ethnicity country, so China staying Chinese could mean anything

For Poland he doesn't say stay Polish, he oddly says white. Which is extra weird, since they are a more cohesive ethnic group of Poles. They want to be Polish</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If you have a really simplistic worldview. Testosterone, first of all, isn't a single action hormone. In fact, as far as aggression as an example, it isn't even the cause of aggression, it simply makes it more likely for a person who has aggressive tendencies to be aggressive.

When you give a male who feels like a female testosterone, it makes that person feel MORE dysphoria, not less, likely because testosterone enhanced what tendencies already exist rather than causing something to happen that wasn't there.

See for example [Hamburger 1953](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/285400), who reports,

&gt; Experience concerning the effect of treatment with male sex hormones
(testosterone) is limited. In the cases in which such
treatment has been administered, the effects have not
been up to expectations.

[Benjamin 1967](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00224496709550519) reports,

&gt; I have heard rather frequently in the patient's history that androgen had been used in the past in an attempt to cure the transsexualism by masculinization. It is the wrong treatment. It aggravates the condition by increasing libido without changing its character or direction. Androgen is contraindicated.

(Apologies, the links to the full texts are paywalled but the links can provide you a start)

In fact, often trans men report that hormonal birth control (estrogen for example) also increases the feelings of dysphoria.</div>

 I also think there shouldn'tt be Special Olympics. Put them all together. Just add in a hot dog eating contest so they can win a few.

We built Codexia because we got sick of bouncing between Cursor, terminals, and random ChatGPT chats just to get one feature shipped. The context-switching was killing our flow, and honestly, we knew we could do better.



So we built a prompt-first IDE, [https://github.com/milisp/codexia](https://github.com/milisp/codexia) that wraps Codex CLI’s raw power into something act...</div>

You're absolutely right that there are established players! We built this because our workflow was getting killed by bouncing between different tools. Cursor is great, but we wanted something laser-focused on Codex CLI with better session management and context preservation. Sometimes you just need a tool that fits your exact workflow, even if bigger solutions exist. Plus, open sourcing it means others with similar pain points can benefit too.</div>

Actually, I like it. It's like a combination of refusal, refutation, and rebuttal.

I submit we add it to the reddit dictionary. If there is one.

I've seen the post circling around about how the Anthropic CEO said 90% of code will be AI generated, and I think he was right - but it wasn't Anthropic that did it. From my 2 hours of usage, I think...</div>

Programming changed SO fast this year, it's insane. In 2023 I went from only using tab autocomplete with Copiliot (and occasional ChatGPT chat, which with 2023 models was nearly useless) to a coworker doing 90% of my work.</div>

It would be much more clear if we measure how fast the feature is implemented within the same level of price and quality in comparison to non-AI-adjusted engineer. Or how cheap (if it's even achievable) it is for a non-dev or a junior dev to implement a feature within the same time and quality that the senior engineer has.</div>

And there was so many posts about how he was wrong and I am sitting here like, yeah I am fairly certain every single one of you did not actually use Codex because it is getting VERY close to 90-95% at this point, especially with the new Codex updates today.

Most common response back was people claiming that my codebase was too simple, and I am literally having Codex write in C++ doing IPC and multithreading, you literally can't get any more complex beyond driver level code lol</div>
