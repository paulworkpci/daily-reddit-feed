**So don't base your happiness on getting more things done.**

If you achieve 3x your current productivity, you'll still have an endless backlog. You'll never be on top of everything. So you need to let go of the endless backlog of tasks and see it as just possibilities, not as things you *have to* do. You don't have to do anything. It's a matter of what you *choose* to do.

And that means **prioritizing is the #1 skill to learn in...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I actually journaled about this last night. I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed with the never ending cycle of day to day to-dos while also struggling with my mental health. I’ve been feeling so behind and like I can never catch up. Just working, making meals to eat/grocery shopping, keeping my apartment clean, and showering are things I have to do daily and when those things are completed, I rarely have enough energy or time to tackle any of the things on my list that keep getting pushed off which have kept me from feeling content. These things feel like the bare minimum and it’s disappointing to not be more productive. When I finally do something I have to do all the time like washing the dishes, my inner monologue is like “It’s about time you did that. On to the next thing.” 

So I posed this question to myself, “How can I learn to be genuinely happy with this overwhelm of never ending todos knowing it will never be finished, no matter how much you do?” It reminded me a lot of the idea of learning to appreciate the journey rather than focusing on the final destination. 

I knew it HAD to be a mindset shift. Or else I would never feel satisfied. I knew the answer wouldn’t lie in some productivity hack, no matter how helpful. 

I’m looking to reframe my thinking to recognize that the fulfillment comes IN the journey, not after it. And to reframe thinking “I have to…” to “I get to…” and to be positive and mindful during the mundane repetitive tasks. 

Life isn’t about finishing, it’s about experiencing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I also journaled about what actually makes me happy since being productive was not fulfilling me anymore. I wrote down certain activities and then thought why does this thing make me happy? What feeling does it give me? 

I’m in a pretty isolating environment at the moment so feelings like love, connection, and comfort from others are a bit out of my control. But other things very much are. 

Things like having variety and fun in my day to day, doing things that challenge me or empower me or give me more confidence make me happy. Having things that stimulate my mind and having a community to talk about those things with make me happy. Things that are purely pleasurable like good food and music make me happy. Having peace of mind and feeling understood, heard, and validated make me happy. 

And now I will focus on cultivating these feelings more instead of zoning in on productivity like I have been for so many years.</div>

But we don’t treat it that way. 

We’re obsessed with reaching the finish line—whether it’s hitting a career milestone, launching a business, or just getting through the week. And in that obsession, we lose our grip on what actually fuels real productivity: PRESENCE.

I’ve caught myself doing this. I set big goals, and instead of enjoying the process—actually engaging with the work—I fixate on t...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Very well put, and it fits my struggles. So many organizational apps are predatory on ADHD tendencies-- here is the answer, here is the magic key, here is the way out, you can finally get your shit together and be productive and responsible.  

But there is no way out, only through. And that means the real messy you, the whole cart of misfit toys.

And you said it, presence is the key. Because when you're present you find things out about yourself, like how much grief and shame and fantasy you've been getting by on (stay up late, wake up tired, feel bad at day's end, try to make it up and stay up too late, etc. etc.). The magic app does not force you to face that stuff, so it does not gain traction. Its sole purpose is the 6.99 a month it needs to get from you.

Instead of feeling shame from scrolling here, just let yourself not scroll, parts of you are pleading RIGHT NOW for a break. Just take twenty seconds and notice how your skin feels, the color of particular things around you, your breath. Then see what happens. Build the practice from presence, and it will not feel like an outside imposition but a discovery.</div>

I love this. This is exactly how I felt today when I was writing this post. I was scrolling and getting discouraged by the negativity and I decided to close the app, but then I came back. "I should put some positivity to counteract the negativity, be the change I want to see." And it didn't feel forced or difficult at all. It just flowed out and I didn't second-guess myself at all before posting it. 

I'm glad my observation brought some light to your personal experience :)</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/Successful-Pumpkin27:

SS: A report of www.grenzwissrnschaft-aktuell.de, a German online journal which covers UFOs regularly in a scientific orientated way. From time to time there are English articles as well. A good site which keeps me updated, without loosing my head in reddit - highly recommend, at least for German folks. 

The article contains a visual sighting experience which could surprisingly be corroborated by a passive radar system operated by an UFO researcher of German „Society for the Investigation of UFO Phenomena e.V.“ (GEP). 
This seems to be the first time a passive radar system was used for this, showing that it could be a proper technology for future investigations. 
Also the corroborated form of the UAP is fairly new to the already known forms.

                                <div class="reply-body">Article doesn't clearly say what kind of passive radar. Multiple types. Some are simply looking for intentional or unintentional RF emissions. Some work by detecting perturbations in the existing RF environment (from TV masts, cell phone masts, radio towers etc) caused by objects that reflect or absorb RF. Then there are multiple localisation techniques. 
I'd like to understand what 'exactly' they've done to then understand whether it is emitting RF and at what wavelength or waveband, or, whether it is absorbing, reflecting, or refracting RF. The latter may indicate some form of GR related warp signature. I'd also be interested in any existing RF environment frequencies and whether they were red or blue shifted.
This is how we get to the science.</div>

It's a 1:1 trade. Steal from others in this life, and you're just taking from yourself. 

Edit: This is just a perspective I particularly like. I think it makes a lot of sense scientifically. We really are the universe experiencing itself. I'm just taking it a step further. If it resonates, see where it takes you. If not, that's fine too!!!</div>

I’d imagine Elon is trying to reshape the govt to run like his companies (10 h1-b visas chained up in a basement coding 20 hours a day).

So my question is, if we eliminate say 25% of jobs through this and AI, what happens to the quarter of the country that don’t have a job?

They just get nothing while also getting laughed at? It genuinely feels like Elon wants the entire middle and lower class to just vanish.

Like everything, Elon plays victim, but when you take away a person’s job, and that person can’t feed their family, and then you publicly mock them.. at some point you need to come to terms with these assassination threats being your fault.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Valid perspective.  He does seem to be all about hard work etc, but he fails to understand that people have different genetics. Different brain chemistry.  Some people are predisposed to being highly creative mentally, and just daydream a lot thinking up potential futures or scenarios. They have difficulty just pumping out focused work for hours on end.  Others have low natural intelligence or what you would call a predisposition to critical thinking and problem solving, which is highly valued in the work force.

There are 8 billion humans here and not all of them are built to be 'theperfectworker.jpeg'

They have other uses, and make other parts of the story work. If you just axe them and remove their ability to provide for themselves, you are going to fuck reality over in absolutely horrible ways.  For someone so supposedly intelligent, he really does not seem to understand this principle.

Unfortunately, lots of folks think this way. They think those types of humans are just inferior or useless and they want them gone. They want everyone to work the way they themselves work.  Which is the highest order of stupid, but they aren't known for their critical thinking on how reality functions I suppose.

On the flipside of this argument though, as others have stated, he does seem to have been in support of UBI or universal high income.</div>

Luckily I don't need one for my job, but my friend has a "work smartphone" she leaves at her desk, and I know some people for whom flip phones aren't an option just severely limit their app usage and screen time allowance.

that doesnt make any sense. if they were worried about someone releasing it, it would have been removed or destroyed long ago.

what makes a lot of sense: it is being destroyed now that Patel is there because Patel is destroying it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It never felt ring-y to me. Seems like a ephebophile perv that roped in his on-and-off longtime pal and got tunnel vision. He was a loser that paid TED-talk intellectuals and rebel professors to hang out with him, but most assumed he was bringing college aged women instead of the occasional high school girl.

I think the FBI has files on pretty much everyone that visited Epstein Island, but they're going to ["GLOMAR denial"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomar_response) all the dead ends to avoid fucking up anybody's reputation. If there was any case file that showed promise of revealing a "ring" or even chained prosecution, that should've materialized in the courts within 2-3 years.

Anything happening now is to save Trump embarrassment from being one of the dead-end files, having something embarrassing in the "background check the Lolita Express passengers" file (almost certain, given his gropey history), or (worst case) evidence that prosecutors didn't think would stick in court.

I don't expect any interesting "truth" from Patel. His FBI will redact everything to protect the innocent, and that goes double for maintaining Trump's innocence. Though I bet Lawrence Krauss and a few others are wording their Trump/government critiques a little more carefully these days, lest one of those files slip out.</div>

Something to that effect. Seeing that was just another example of how lost in the sauce some of these people are to really think Trump is going to end child sex trafficking.

It kept hitting the output limit but telling it “continue” would let it keep going and like… it finished the project (again, I made it start fresh), made a front end without me even asking, then provided an example JSON to run inside the project for debugging purposes. I’ll update later how many lines of code it just wrote as it is getting late for me but JESUS.

                        <div class="comment-body">I had a similar experience today. I mentioned this in another post, but I was trying to build something relatively minor for work myself that we’ve been needing for a while and our third party vendor was failing to provide (I don’t know how to code beyond the most basic of things, so I wanted to see what I could do using AI). Claude 3.5 was failing at one of the objectives I had, as was o3-mini-high. I was going back and forth between the two trying to get it to work and it was just falling apart in the process.

I got it to work with a single prompt in Claude 3.7. I’ve been building it out a bit since then, but the core functionality that I just could not get to work before today just popped out like some sort miracle.

Also, this is personal taste, but I just like its personality more than o3-mini-high. I always feel like o3 wants me to do all the work and is annoyed by prompts.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Okay, folks, let’s talk about Dan Crenshaw—total lightweight, believe me. This guy, with his little eyepatch, thinks he’s tough, like some kind of pirate, but he’s more like a pirate who got lost at sea and ended up begging for crumbs at the RNC. Sad! I mean, I’ve got the best eyes, nobody sees better than me, and even I can see Dan’s a one-trick pony—literally, one eye, not much else going on up there. 

He’s out there talking about freedom, big talk, huge talk, but he’s just another Washington loser playing dress-up as a tough guy. His beard? Disastrous. Looks like he glued it on from a Halloween costume nobody bought. And his tweets? Boring! Low energy! I’d tweet circles around him, folks, circles—people say I’m the best at it, they really do. Dan’s a nice guy, maybe, but he’s no Trump. Not even close. Sit down, Dan, you’re out of your league—bigly!</div>

Good companies will listen to complaints; great companies will reward their employees for raves. 

Those two plumbers are getting bonuses, and that’s just cool.

My senior citizen aunt was VERY demanding, to the point that I was mortified. The waitress took it all in stride with a smile on her face. 

I was so impressed I told her manager that she was a great staff member and I would gladly come back in the future.</div>

Either someone actually crashed out on a customer and we gotta deal with that or we’re about to have to feign sympathy for a psychopath and coddle them to retain their business and not get ourselves a complaint… ugh.. but when people have a compliment for our employees it’s amazing and everyone just gets to feel good about themselves and their job for once, doesn’t happen often enough</div>

Initially, I thought it was to get rid of all of the mockery/stigma that's built up around those topics over the decades as we moved towards... something.

Then the hearings were had, and the drones/orbs flap happened.  Then... nothing.

Something is off but - unless something major happens - I think the current political climate is going to distract from/overshadow this topic for the next several years.</div>

It's reminding me of how AI images have become photo real and then videos...and now video games may be in the same boat soon!

Just need to keep working on control/interactivity on the dev side of things (text input is never going to be enough). Then once we have GPT-5 level and beyond I feel like truly infinite AI driven simulations will be possible. Anything you want to do in a game will be quickly invented as you do it. It'll make GTA6 look like a tiny scope super small mobile game.</div>

If you don’t know what to ask for you get slop. All these dreams you have of making video games on the fly won’t exist because you can’t conceptualize the prompt needed to achieve “GTA 6” graphics.
