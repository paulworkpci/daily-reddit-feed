I use AI instead of googling and will always opt for a reasoning model. I'm fine waiting 40 seconds if the AI is actually thorough and filters out the nonsense most of the time. In fact I spend well over 40 seconds trying to condense useful information from a search myself with how Google is now.</div>

If there are very little or zero hits on google for the thing I want have information on all LLM's start to hallucinate. Reasoning will not help there. 


If there is more information, I will get a reasonable summary and good results.  With or without reasoning.</div>

1. Why so many people seem to be unaware of how smart the o1 / o3 / o4 models were. They weren't even using them.

4. Why the naming changed.</div>

Most people have no idea there is more than one chatgpt model, nevermind knowing that they can actually pick the model themselves. Most people never click the buttons on their UI. 

The one time I showed my mom o3, she thought it was annoying because it didn't give her an answer immediately. She thought I somehow gave her a downgraded version of chatgpt. Mind you, she is an engineering professor, not an average person. But she simply never encountered anything that would inform her about these things. Stuff that we take for granted here would take like a decade to trickle down to the general population</div>

I remember the expose's about shut ins who became addicted to being online. They forgot their job, family, everything, all to be on the /new/ internet all day. These people were shown as examples of the dangers of this new thing called "the internet". I think AI and LLMs are going through it now. Edge-case users are using the new tool in unhealthy ways now. Society gets scared because we fear the unknown future ahead. I think in time we will find a place for AI in our world. Things will normalize and level out. Some bad aspects will emerge. Some good will, too. Just buckle up and get ready.</div>

There's all lowercase sama, the marketing department hype man who speaks unintelligently and overpromises, trying to resonate with a certain demographic on Twitter.

Then there's the real Sam, the one who types like an adult and speaks his mind unfiltered. 

I find the lowercase grating, but at least he uses syntax clues to easily identify which tweets aren't worth reading.</div>

Not saying there isn't some concerns that are legitimate, just that it isn't opposed to his companies interest in a different way, especially since most of their money is from Enterprise users, so small users using it as a friend might even be a financial loss, or something similar. It's a use case that's unprofitable because it only happens for non-enterprise users.</div>

Even if classical computing will never produce digital consciousness, billions worldwide will perceive sentience in their lifelike virtual loved ones. All judgments aside, this is a pretty substantial sociopolitical phenomenon.

Even with all that, neuromorphic computing and biocomputing will reach animal-scale in my lifetime.
So what Sam describes above is the prelude to a new societal challenge that will last decades.</div>

I fear the human psyche can only tolerate so much deviation from the natural state of things before cracks open up and the social fabric frays.

Which is definitely scary because those folks seem like they could be easily influenced by subtle system prompt tweaks. No AGI needed…

The era of AI being a super-persuader has definitely arrived much earlier than anticipated. Just how long will it be before an influential politician or something falls for this and becomes fully beholden to a private corporation, lest they “kill” their “loved one?”</div>

Then the hybrid turbo comes out and suddenly every reviewer loves how “they removed all the lag!”

Same thing happened to a lesser extent with the 7spd manual. But more people in period were criticizing it 

I’m sure there’s a million more in just Porsche alone. But curious to see what other inconstancies or ...</div>

"You just gotta do the maintenance",  is that going to prevent cheap plastic cooling pipes from bursting? prevent sensors from going out?  REALLY?  most of the issues I see have nothing to do with maintenance.

A Toyota/Honda breaks down with 200,000 miles and they say "HA! see! they have issues too!"  .. meanwhile their euro car has endless issues after 80,000 miles and the maintenance is double/triple the cost. 

"Well.. what do you expect from a high mileage car??",  dude... 80k should be almost like new. 

My sister is learning all this the hard way.  She paid MORE for a GLB250, than I paid for a bigger and more equipped Ascent.  My sister has had to borrow the Ascent a lot of times.</div>

Surely this will ruffle feathers but I still laugh at that discussion a week or two ago on replacing rod bearings in a bmw s85.

"Just replace the rod bearings as a preventative step and you'll have a bulletproof motor".

"It's a high performance motor of course these things will happen"

Hey point taken. But try making that statement about any other brand and you'll get laughed at. There are lots of motors out there that will become bulletproof if having to open it up was considered acceptable</div>

Though I’ve quit cigarettes for a while, the notion of stepping outside physically for a quick de-stressing activity was nice for me. So this morning I just went outside and meditated for a few, then went back in. I like the vibe and I will keep it up if nothing else.

Not great to have a positive association for something that's actually bad for you, but great news you've managed to replace it with something healthy for even better effects.

                        <div class="comment-body">this is literally how i quit smoking!!! 

i RAVE to anybody who dares to ask me how i did it - because it was easily one of the hardest things i've ever done and "going out for a cigarette" and replacing the habit with meditation for 7 minutes. 

i was so desperate to quit that i was trying everything i coudl think of - and i was not confident that meditating was going to work -  but i just took it craving by craving and meditated each time which compounded massively and in ways that i didnt anticipate 

it was so impactful that i haven't had a single puff in 5 YEARS and i had been trying to quit for years when i did. thanks for sharing - it feels good to know that i'm not alone in my logic!</div>

 DON’T DO THIS.

* It wastes time and money and
* It makes the AI **dumber.**

In fact, the graph above is what lazy prompting does to your AI.

It's a graph (from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01798)) of how GPT 3.5 performed on a test of common sense after an initial prompt and then after one or two lazy prompts (“recheck your work for errors.”)...</div>

Step 1 can be automatically included in tools.
Step 2, you can ask the LLM to rephrase/expand it. Example: ”implement auth”

3: the LLM + text selection should be able to generate a phrase.

4 and 5: ask LLM to generate an analysis 

6: ask LLM/+tool to include files</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">"Just do it yourself" is problably under explored by devs that use AI.

In fact, I suspect many devs over-rely on AI. METR had some [interesting results](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/) showing that using AI actually *slowed down* open-source developers instead of speeding them up.

I kind of don't believe their result, but it's very interesting.

Before they kept old models and just added new ones. Then they could quietly discontinue the models no one was using anymore.

Maybe they know that no one would use gpt-5 if the old models were still available.

Maybe we should be thankful they made it so obvious.</div>

The rules are simple:

Fixed amount goes in monthly (whatever you can afford)

Once it's in there you can spend it on literally anything without guilt

When it's gone it's gone until next month

Never dip into other accounts for impulse stuff

It's been amazing for my relationship with money....</div>

And ever since I first heard that story over a decade ago, when he used to talk about what a shit job it was and that's why he quit so quickly, he has exaggerated it to sound like he actually did the job for any amount of time. 

Between that and being a limo driver, his only other real job before he got lucky as fuck a few years into even starting doing stand up as a full time job was teaching martial arts. Something he seemingly loves and loved so much it's hard to really consider being a teacher of it to be some mental or physical slog like most normal jobs are.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yup. All of the "essential work" turns out to be the least compensated/respected by society. Literally the jobs that, without which, society would collapse. Meanwhile, middle-managers held zoom meeting after zoom meeting to discuss the next zoom meeting while still collecting their full paychecks while "working" from home. It's depressing dude. The jobs that actually make our lives livable are treated so poorly while some fucking nuisance streamer can make millions being a total piece of human garbage. Our society incentivizes all of the wrong behaviour.</div>
