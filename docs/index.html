                <div class="post-content">For the last few years I was mostly addicted to YouTube and spent hours on it every day. Lately I've been listening mostly to background music at work and I have the last 6 youtubers in my subs.

Everything doesn't seem to give me anything anymore, thousands of channels on how to make millions, reaction videos, depressing videos like the crisis of relationships, housing, economy, stock market etc. 

Everything has been said 100x times over on youtube and there's no need to watch much more stuff ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">We jumped the content shark some years ago. The problem is that the cost of content creation is roughly zero now, so everyone can put the dumbest recycled garbage up without almost no effort. It reminds me of all the recipe sites where you have to scroll through someone’s life story to learn how to make potato soup. YouTube just happens to be the poster child. 

I used to watch it a lot for music videos and music in general. I also liked stuff dealing with history and cars. I don’t remember when I finally just quit looking at it, maybe once Covid started and I started subscribing to streaming channels. Wasn’t a deliberate choice, just really gravitated elsewhere.</div>

My YouTube recommendations are mostly music, science education, and old TV shows and movies.

I've encountered other people who tell me that YouTube is nothing but brainrot and garbage, but YouTube doesn't even recommend those things to me.</div>

'It’s been an amazing last couple of weeks, hope you enjoyed our end of year extravaganza as much as we did!  
  
Just some of the things we shipped: state-of-the-art image, video, and interactive world models (*Imagen 3, Veo 2 &amp; Genie 2*); *Gemini 2.0 Flash* (a highly performant and efficient foundation model); *Gemini-Exp-1206* model (top of the Chatbot Arena leaderboard); *2.0 Flash Thinking* (our first ‘thinking’ model, expect a lot more news on this soon - as many of you remember, we pioneered this type of model with *AlphaGo, AlphaZero, AlphaProof*…); upgrades to [@GeminiApp](https://x.com/GeminiApp) with Deep Research and more, fantastic new *NotebookLM* features, a new image remixing tool (*Whisk*); and a series of agentic research prototypes that can help people get things done (*Project Astra, Mariner, Jules*) all built on Gemini 2.0.  
  
And then on top of all of that, we dropped the world’s most accurate weather prediction model (*GenCast*), the world’s most advanced quantum chip that performed a computation that would have taken 10 septillion years (*Willow* \- could come in handy for training AI one day!), and it was the honour of a lifetime to receive the Nobel Prize for *AlphaFold*, which has revolutionised structural biology and is being used by 2 million researchers around the world to understand disease and accelerate drug discovery.  
  
I could not be more proud of all the exceptionally talented teams at [@GoogleDeepMind](https://x.com/GoogleDeepMind) &amp; [@Google](https://x.com/Google) who have worked so incredibly hard on all these amazing projects. It’s the greatest joy one can have professionally to get to explore the outer reaches of science and human knowledge with such wonderful colleagues.  
  
We’ve been inventing the future of AI for well over a decade now, and we’ll continue to be a relentless engine of innovation. In many ways we’re only just getting started… if you want to be at the frontier of the most exciting scientific and technological journey ever, this is the place to be, come join us!'[](https://x.com/demishassabis/status/1871309937730613704)</div>

LEV is a somewhat silly concept. 

5 years after LEV we will have artificial intelligence which is orders of magnitude more intelligent than humans, doubling year on year. 

We are envisioning a future where we will be able to halt aging and live on Earth indefinitely. 

Yet in truth the outcome is beyond out wildest comprehension. 

We are just as likely to collapse the wave function, crack the hard problem of consciousness, create a digital God and teleport all of humanity into heaven space.</div>

If I had thought I was witnessing extraterrestrial phenomena, or even experimental technology in public space, I would drop everything until I had a better idea of what was happening, hopefully documenting along the way.

I have been gifted scratchers before that won small amounts and the thought of giving any back was never even on the radar. It’s a gift. You gave it away. If it was conditional on it only being yours if you lost, it was a really shitty gift. </div>

Not that I’m one to buy lottery tickets, but I would not be offended if someone won but and didn’t return anything. A gift is a gift, once you give it, it’s theirs.</div>

This is something I had to come to grips with after years of denial. If I want to wake up at time X, I actually have to set my alarm for that time. And the first few days will absolutely suck, but there are no shortcuts.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Go to bed earlier.

Have something to look forward to, like a nice breakfast, a morning walk or a playlist.

Avoid caffeine at least 6 hours before bed and try to have your last meal at least 2-3 hours before bed.

Lay out your outfit, prepare your breakfast and set goals for the next day. Knowing you’re ready for the morning reduces anxiety.

Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.

Don’t snooze (place your alarm across the room).

In the morning, open your curtains or step outside as soon as possible. Morning light resets your circadian rhythm and boosts energy.

Shift your bedtime and wake-up time by 15-30 minutes earlier every few days until you reach your target.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">"Just go to bed earlier" is not the answer. That's how I stayed in the rut night-owl-ism for years. It just doesn't work.

If anyone is struggling with waking up at a certain time, you have to obey this fact: when you go to bed is dictated by when you wake up, not the other way around. What that means is that if you want to start sleeping at 10pm and waking up at 6am, you actually have to use an alarm until your body accepts that this is your new reality. This is especially true for insomniacs. I assume that OP is also an insomniac.</div>

That was a game changer for me. Then generally go to sleep earlier. Drink tons of water, you’ll feel more awake during the day, which will promote healthier sleep.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It has mostly to do with the fact LLMs can't see the grid the way we see it since text appears linear to them and also they have to draw the final grid manually to solve the tasks, quite a few of the failures were straight up wrong grid size but the logic itself was dead on. We humans mostly ignore the grid unless we're using it for alignment which is why grid size matters little to us. 

Imagine how difficult it would be to solve these problems if you were blind and had to rely on someone else telling you the color for each square on the grid 1 by 1 and at the end you had to say your solution out loud square by square</div>

Biological brains have visual cortex as an accelerator. For LLMs to do well with visual tasks I think something like this needs to be developed, or maybe not if the compute is there that it can "brute force" it.</div>

No one will disclose it: not the US, not China, not Russia, not any nation.

It's compute all the way down. It will take longer, but it will still work. We are at a breaking point, where compute will get so cheap, that AI will be able to generate enough economically valuable work that it will self sustain development of new chips and mass manufacturing of chips.

If GPT5 needs to be 1 000x bigger instead of 100x bigger (like with difference between gpt-3 vs gpt-4), then that is only a single gen of GPU. If GPT5 needs to be 10 000 bigger, then it will be delayed by 2 generations of GPU. And that extra time can be spent on perfecting the model, fine tuning and to actually give some extra time for the robot manufacturing to catch up to speed of development of AI, as currently AI is vastly outpacing how fast can we build robots.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Nah it means that orion is not the base model. Tbh I'm a bit surprised since the cost of full o3 is huge so it would be logical for it to be a multi-trillion model.

I think it's rumored that o1 was used to generate synthetic data for orion, which in turn was used to make synthetic data for o3 (but with more detailed knowledge since it's a huge model).

We'll likely never see orion or a finetuned orion as a customer product. It is likely very slow and costly and doesn't score high on benchmarks like the reasoning models.</div>

"just" is a gross oversimplification, but the point is that the raw cost per token did NOT change significantly from o1.

But to your main point, RE: internal models used solely to improve release candidate models -- This feels like a great way for OpenAI to benefit immediately from models without needing to wade through 6 months of adversarial red team testing.  When only OpenAI employees can prompt it, you can start using it productively much quicker.</div>

My best guess is that the "o" models each start with a base pre-trained LLM (like 4o or Orion), and bootstrap from there.  The reason for this large increase in performance in such a short time is because "o" training and Orion reached maturity at similar times.</div>

I disagree. The computed per-output token cost for o3 is around $60 per 1 million tokens, which is the same as o1 - see this blog post for details: https://www.interconnects.ai/p/openais-o3-the-2024-finale-of-ai .</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">No, the only thing we so far saw it being way more compute intensive in, is ARC AGI. But there for each task it generated 6 parallel chains of thought in low compute mode, and 1000 in high. I bet they mostly had to do it this way due to inefficiency and size limitations of the models context window.
We also don't know how much the "high" compute setting cost in doing other benchmarks and how many of such parallel tries were used. (By the way, it seems o1 pro mode uses them too)


They also, at the same time, trained o3 mini, which is a few times cheaper than o1 mini, and in some tasks that they show, is closer to o1 full in performance.


Some of the OpenAI staff said that the only difference between o1 and o3 is much more reinforcement learning on top.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Some things that have worked for me:

On the days I don’t workout, I try to do something else productive during that time usually at a coffee shop. I basically aim for the same routine 5 days a week. Recently I’ve been brushing up on job interviews.

I also kind of accept that after 40-50/week + workouts + chores + downtime + socializing, I’m not doing anything else big on weekdays.

Sundays is when I do most my non-day job “work”. I plan my week, spend a few hours on something (e.g. side project), do my chores, and try to have a good chunk of down time in the evening. 

Not burning myself out during the weekdays helps feel ok “working” Sundays, and I sometimes skip it if needed. 

Pacing my work, planning my weeks and my days, and doing strategies like the other commenter suggesting with 50/10min are all things I do that help be productive without running myself to the ground.

Finally, plan on longer scales of time. Either quarterly or I like thirds (4 month period.) Year long plan is too far out imo. Understand your bigger goals and plan accordingly. You can’t focus 100% on everything all at once, but you can shift focus to different areas at different times. If you plan the longer scale, you’ll feel comfortable accepting that. For example, this past August I did a lifting competition, so July-Aug was focused on lifting. Big work deadline in Sept, so I went all in on that, working a few 50-60 hour weeks. Then took a week Vacation. Then went harder on side project while both workouts and my day jobs were more chill.</div>

Social media only influences three of them: dopamine, serotonin, and cannabinoids. But all six can be influenced by real human connections; it's just something social media can’t replace. The same can be...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is how it started for me 20+ years ago during my childhood.

Edit: gosh now I think about it so many memories come back. Me being 15 years old just chatting with random people in a chatbox to get some social connection. Later I started MMORPG's.   
Still, the real problems didn't begin until about 6-7 years ago when internet browsing, youtube, reddit and such became more and more the thing I did. Those activities seem to be worse than playing video games for me. 

That is what negatively influenced my memory and focus so much.</div>

Just because something is hard, doesn't mean it's impossible. You seem to have theorised your way to why you can't do something, so you have an excuse. 

Also not getting these chemicals from the internet, will increase your desire to get them elsewhere, thus helping you find ways to make friends. Where as dumbing it with the internet will help keep you friendless.

This is ultimately the problem with the internet and content consumption, it is numbing you by giving your these chemicals easily, without that, then you have more desire and motivation to do something in the real world. 

Dopamine can come from achieving your goals and making progress. It's not a social chemical. The same with serotonin can come from sunlight and exercise.

It's not the no friends that is the issue, it's not having a life, which is different. If you get some goals, some things you want to achieve and you go after those, it will make quitting internet easier, without it, it is closer to the impossible that you speak off, it still wouldn't be impossible, but it would also be kinda pointless, quit the internet to do what instead? The internet is intreasting, if you want to quit it, you need a life that is even more intreasting and that doesn't always require friends and if you focus on the other stuff, the friends will come.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Your assertion is fraught with an egregious oversimplification of neurochemical pathways and their interdependencies. To claim that abstinence from a specific stimulus will organically transmute into the acquisition of alternative stimuli demonstrates a reductionist outlook that disregards the nuanced interrelation of psychosocial motivators and reward systems. Dopamine, as a neurochemical, may indeed be involved in goal-oriented activities, but its sociogenic aspect cannot be summarily dismissed as extrinsic; rather, it is inherently interwoven with communal reinforcements. Similarly, your delineation of serotonin as a mere byproduct of sunlight and exercise fails to address its intricate role in human affiliation and emotional equilibrium. The presupposition that deprivation catalyzes compensatory behaviors assumes a linear causality that belies the stochastic nature of human behavioral adaptation. The internet's facilitation of these chemicals does not inherently "numb" individuals but rather reflects a maladaptive recalibration of reward thresholds, a phenomenon far more multifaceted than your assertion allows. Lastly, your dichotomy between "a life" and "friends" overlooks the fundamental sociological constructs that define human existence as irreducibly relational. Thus, I counter your argument not with an invitation to self-reflection but with an acknowledgment of its circumlocutory inadequacy in capturing the profundity of the human condition</div>
