They hired me, and the director took me around to introduce me. As he did, he introduced me as his “assistant.” I somehow found the courage to correct him, on my first day (😬). Since I still had the ad, they couldn’t argue, and were forced to create that position for me.</div>

                <div class="post-content">For years, I thought I was “growing” by bingeing spiritual podcasts, YouTube talks, and endless books. But honestly? I was still empty. The more I consumed, the more disconnected I felt—from myself, from others, from any real sense of purpose.

Then I stumbled on a verse from the Bhagavad Gita:  
*“You have the right to perform your prescribed duties, but not to the fruits of your actions.”* (2.47)  
It hit me: I was living on the fruits of others’ work, but not cultivating my own garden.

I can get a functional web page with a few prompts, give any document to Gemini and have it answer any question I could have, create a podcast of it with notebooklm in my mother tongue, and countless other things.

Don't even get me started on Veo 3.

Current  generation of models is definitively whole generation ahead of original gpt4.

                                <div class="reply-body">"Agentic capabilities" are mostly a marketing bullshit thought. You need a very low error rate, long context, tool use, preferably good image recognition(depending on the type of the agent). There are no special capabilities inherent for a model, all of the above is very useful for a model regardless if it is an agent or not. And all the functionality that makes it "agentic" is an external orchestration. Models are not trained to be agents, they are trained on individual tasks that are useful for both agentic and normal workflows. I mean there is some RLHF to make it work better with orchestration engines, but better model overall will be a better "agent" almost always.</div>

But I hear about things like using Roo Code. Then I see it has a million choices for the LLM it uses. And many new terms like quantization. A bit overwhelming.  
  
And new stuff is being created by the hour. So my question is this, for someone like me, with minimal coding expertise, and I'm cheap, what is the best setup I can run tomorrow to build my next app?

                        <div class="comment-body">Two ways to build app
- ask questions and copy paste from chat (boring, slow, cheap)
- use IDE/plugin/cli tool which read your entire codebase (fast, easy, expensive)

Example : you added a new feature - show top sales of coconut by month - using tools approach it can easily update the code in various location - frontend, middleware, api creation, sql creation.... Using 1 single prompt.

Without tools, you would have to copy paste it 5-7 times and still would make few mistakes.

which is cheapest tool? It's vscode plugin like roo/cline with llm api. IDE like cursor and cli like claude code is expensive

To answer your question,
- create and get a api key of openrouter.ai
- search on site for free models
- use that free model on roo plugin
- practice, practice 
- understand pricing of  each question/prompt you ask

Once you mastered prompting, start using premium tools.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My work flow uses copy paste from chat, and I can't imagine using the IDE tools loose on my code like that. I'm configuring environments to run kafka, spark, airflow and olap db's, and locally hosted llms, and all the work required is 90% discussing about the best way to go about it (centralised logging, auto data reconciliation etc) that I just know would all be undone as soon as I take the breaks off the agentic llm. I use TDD to build each component in turn, then follow up with the integration testing and it's baby steps the entire way to avoid polluting the code with inconsistent code patterns. Any chance it gets, the llm stops using my preferred decorator approach, creates some brand new way of logging and I'd have duplicate and inconsistent ways of doing things all over the shop.

Maybe for simple poc apps, but not on actual multi repo systems.

Would be interested if anyone has an experience that can change my mind. Kilo code looks like a potential option, but the focus is on the coding side, not the architecture and coding patterns side of this. I know there's an architecture agent, but in my experience I'm using o3 for ages before a single line of code is written and when it is, it's precise and one fully tested module at a time. I feel like a system like kilo code needs a fully configured chief architect agent for each line of code written to ensure it is inline with proper thinking, and the chief tester agent to assure the quality and consistency before the coding agent is let loose on introducing a whole new set of problems.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly this. Remove every single in-between iteration between 4 &amp; 5 and you'd see a far more massive leap that the prior jumps. People are just desensitized because of the fast iteration, but it's worth noting that's exactly what Open AI wanted in the first place.

Of course, they want measurable improvements, but they are always more concerned with societal adaptation. If we jumped straight from basic GPT-4 in March to 5, assuming all other company models also stayed within this range, people would likely lose their collective shit. The reaction to Sora which they admitted was a kind of societal test also proves this, but now we're very used to it.</div>

Also a reminder that, whatever general model they have internally, is as good as a dedicated thinking maths model was only months ago.</div>

Not that Gemini is much better. It'll come up with an idea, I'll turn it down and correct it and it'll praise me for coming up with the idea I just turned down. 0.o at least they correct when called out on it xD</div>

They probably has a bot having 100s of convos for him and trying to arrange dates for him. So my guess is you’ll get a generic GPT response to yoir reply.  

My guess is the photos are probably AI enhanced, as well. 

Honestly this is probably a net good thing for society if this destroys dating apps and people have to meet in person and not treat people like disposable commodities. </div>

Texas has one of the largest concentrations of Christian Zionists, so that checks out; [30% of Texans identify as Evangelical/Christian Zionist](https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/state/texas/). 

Evangelicals believe that the Jews must occupy Jerusalem in order for the Second Coming of Jesus, which is why they seek to quiet those that speak out against Israel. They also comprise the largest voting bloc in the country, overwhelmingly voting Republican. Ted Cruz being one of them.</div>

And they are all for that because orange jesus.

Trump is probably already privately contacting folks that have bashed him:  liberal leaders, media owners and personalities etc...   they are likely being informed that there is a possibility that their names might be appearing on Ghislains list of 100, and that they need to do exactly what orange jesus says to ensure that does not happen.

Trumpers know that dear leader has already fixed the game, and they love it.  They think its more evidence of 3d chess, and they put their whole being into him owning the libs.  

Whether he is actually an epstien pedo does not matter to them in the slightest.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt; The 19-year-old Naibel Benavides, who was a college student at the time, died on April 25, 2019, after being struck by a Tesla Model S sedan driven by George Brian McGee. McGee had dropped his phone while approaching a T-intersection with Tesla’s Autopilot software activated. The NYT report states that he drove through the intersection at more than 50 mph, crashing into the legally parked SUV of Benavides and her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, on the other side.

&gt; It was also reported that McGee's foot was on the accelerator pedal as he approached the intersection, thereby overriding a function of Autopilot that is capable of stopping for objects in the road. The lawyer representing Benavides' family said that data and video from the crash showed that the Autopilot system recognized the parked SUV and at least one pedestrian before the collision.

How in the world is tesla even partially responsible here, his foot was on the accelerator. The best L2 systems will override if you have your foot on the accelerator, the car recognized the obstacle. Should we really set precedent that the car should have priority over human inputs? Am I missing something?

The name is misleading, but autopilot in 2019 could not stop at stop signs, lights, etc.. Like, two seconds with the system or two seconds in the manual and you would know this.</div>

&gt;The best L2 systems will override if you have your foot on the accelerator,


This is not entirely true. It would defeat the whole point of the "Automatic Emergency Braking" feature that virtually all cars sold today have. Think of a situation where you are looking at your radio controls, and a child runs out across the street. You'd have your foot against the pedal to maintain speed. If any amount accel pedal was allowed to override, you'd hit the child.


Most OEMs calibrate the system to require a substantial amount of acceleration pedal depressed to override the system. In many cases, as much as 80%.</div>

You can exfiltrate an entire model by just collecting its outputs.

"You would never steal a car" == "You would never copy and mass aggregate the responses of our LLM."

AI model piracy is about to become a big thing. DeepSeek was just the first.

And there's nothing these companies can do to stop it.

I love to see it. This is why the companies just need to adopt open models. They're going to be fighting an unwinnable war to protect their models.</div>

Anthropic has demonstrated through their actions, public statements, and interpretability research that they are serious about safety. It's a self selecting group of people who all think that AI is going to be very impactful and has the chance of going wrong if not done properly. 

Of all the companies working at the frontier they are by far the most responsible and committed to doing it right. That doesn't mean they're perfect but at its core anthropic is a company full of idealistic people who are trying to do the right thing.</div>

We, as a collective society, have continued to negotiate down to save the company money. Well it’s 2025 and companies have never reciprocated the care. So stop treating them with human kindness. 
It’s a transaction. You work certain tasks. No more no less. You get paid for that work. No more no less. 
It’s time we take the reins and means of production back. And it’s starts by being able to eat with a roof over your head.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I've negotiated a lot of salaries. The first number sets the board. I would recommend putting a big number out there for yourself. Not stupid, of course, or you'll lose credibility.

  
For example, if you are asking for a raise, ask for 20%. If you're underpaid, the company will see that and adjust you appropriately. Maybe it's 20%, maybe it's 15%, but if you only ask for 10%, that's all you'll get.</div>

I will however play with equity vs salary to try and get to a more agreeable number if I think you’re right. 

Not to say you can’t give what you think is fair, but if you give a really high salary to use as a starting point, it can often be an ending point.</div>
