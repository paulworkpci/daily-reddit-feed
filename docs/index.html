This is how Tilopa simplified it a long time ago:

Let go of what has passed.

Let go of what may come.

Let go of what is happening now.

Don’t try to figure anything out.

Don’t try to make anything happen.

Relax, right now, and rest.</div>

I'll ask it to do something and be very detailed in my prompt, knowing that we only get 3 Opus messages every so often, and then it goes "oh i see! do u want me to do the thing?"

sir i asked you to do the thing in my original prompt, why are you double-checking??? now I have to use another limited Opus message to say "yes claude please, please do the thing i asked you to do"</div>

And then you have to give it the original prompt again so it remembers what it's supposed to do, and you get the "you ran out of free messages" after. Happens to me ever since GPT5 came out, lol.</div>

Often times however, that advice is something the person already knows or could have come up with themselves. 

The best way to support someone going through something is to simply acknowledge that you see they are hurting, and to leave an open-ended "let me know how I can support you".</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I want to build on this idea by adding that it's most helpful if you offer a specific activity you are willing to do, like, "when can I drop off a lasagna for your freezer" or, "I have free time on Tuesday afternoon - can I watch the kids for you from 2-4?". Leaving it open- ended is good for some people, but others will die before they say anything and those are the ones who really need the help. If you offer support and don't get a response, it's ok to reach back out and offer a more definite experience even if it's simply to get together and chat.</div>

It's not far away from current/already researched approaches, a matter of a clever combination of some of those and a lot of computing power to experiment and then train it?  
Video generation + sound generation + text/factual world knowledge binding it together + real-time training for some short-term unproven weights that can be consolidated into main weights later + clever ways to handle parallel thinking and exploration of knowledge stored in neurons (until relevant information is found and a sort of "confidence" increases), and it's AGI, I naively think?  
Other modalities can wait I guess, they are less crucial? We have humans that are sort of GI but can't move/can't see/can't hear/can't speak/can't visualize things in their mind well/or whatever other limit/combination of limits. Still flexible and adaptive, to an extent.</div>

I read a book that explored long lived families, where the great great great grandparents were still biologically in their 60s and their great great great grand kids would visit…creating surreal interactions between someone actually 20 years old and a relative 200+ years old but biologically similar in health.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I love The Culture (read 8 of 9 main novels) but it's relatively unambitious in showing trans/posthumanism. Banks keeps it all pretty recognizable. He deals with mindstates and digitized consciousnesses a bit but doesn't place it under a loop. (which is fair since it's not the focus of the books)

I read Diaspora by Greg Egan a while back, which shows life in a civilization of purely digital entities. That has super wonky implications for identity, progeny, subjective experience etc. 

I think The Culture is great for showing in a grounded way how things could end up well, but I think it's very unlikely we'll arbitrarily enter a stasis at such a "ConventionalHuman++" kind of existence.

Only death of freak accidents or rare diseases or viruses or other external means. It's it more of what we do now but slowly itterating and living? 

Though I do think there might be a point, I might say, "I think I lived long enough. Let me age again to die naturally"</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I admit, I havent read it myself but ive heard Scythe is a decent fiction series that touches on it.


"death, disease, and unhappiness have been virtually eliminated due to advances in technology, and a benevolent artificial intelligence known as the Thunderhead peacefully governs a united Earth. The notable exception to the Thunderhead's rule is the Scythedom, a group of humans whose sole purpose is to replicate mortal death in order to keep the population growth in check."


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythe_(novel)


Altered Carbon is a book/netflix show also lightly touches on it - immortality for those that can afford it. Guy is hired/resurrected to solve a murder. Show is decent, haven't read the book.

Now, i just can't use it anymore. It's lazy, goes off the rails many times, and i ended up wasting more time and effort fixing the slop that it creates. It's was really good in the beginning, but its sad to see the sorry state it is in.

                                <div class="reply-body">Text documents, sensor data, witness records… it’s been trivial to fake shit for ages, arguably as long as human existence. Photoshop has been a thing since the 90s and while it’s harder to get the lighting right, changing a license plate number or a clock face has been trivial for decades. 

The problem is and always has been a different one from how easy it is to fake shit. It’s trust. Shared, society-wide trust in institutions (newspapers, government agencies, universities, medical experts, etc.). 

The attack on trust has been the most effective weapon by right-wing propagandists in recent years. They jumped on that energy of your mom telling you that you shouldn’t trust Wikipedia to basically that *everything* is fake, rigged, manipulated. The New York Times? Fake news! The WHO recommendations for how not to die of shit? Big Pharma conspiracy! Climate scientists saying it’s getting warmer? Lies! 

Once all trust has been broken, once all sources have zero credibility, all sources are equal. Just pick and choose, listen to your gut! Decades of expert knowledge? Worth as much as a crazy YouTube influencer!

I’m growing *very* tired of calls for less trust. AI changes very little. Instead of spending time paranoid of how easy it is to lie, we should focus on how valuable established, renowned institutions are. I already see a scenario like the Washington Post publishing an incrementing photograph of a politician and it being dismissed as “fake news” because it’s so easy to fake with AI. Fuck that. We need to learn how to trust again.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Claude Code is awesome, but it eats tokens like crazy. If you want to stretch your tokens and stop running into limits, I recommend not using it or any other coding agent. Most of the overhead comes from stuff that is easy to do anyway. I made a comparison of a coding agent vs. semi-automatic context construction attacking the same problem and the agent used like 15x more tokens and took way longer. You can see the comparison here: [https://youtu.be/eJWgovbFfcc](https://youtu.be/eJWgovbFfcc)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I really like the agent concept of Claude Code, that allows you to have very long runs without running out of context windows. As subagent context windows are isolated, they do not pollute the master agent's. But I do really miss the comfort of using an IDE.  
Also, there are many cutting-edge features of coding agents that Claude Code does not have but other coding agents, MCP, do, such as using Language Server Protocol to navigate the codebase similar to human programmers, and the ability to use debuggers to resolve difficult bugs that require tracing the data flow and data transformation.  
So I built Zentara, on RooCode base, to add features that are needed for my everyday work.

What are Zentara unique features:  
a) Running parallel subagents, similar to Claude Code agents, with the ability to customize and predefine agents  
b) Search codebase using LSP tools, (similar to Serena MCP but integrated as internal tools) such as searching a class, function symbolically, go to definition, find usage of particular functions, etc.  
c) Runtime debugging: Zentara can leverage a debugger, automatically set breakpoints, step in, step out, read the stack variables, and do stack tracing.

You can enhance any existing coding agent by MCP servers. But in my experience, a coding agent a lot of times is just lazy to use the available MCP tools. For example, I cannot make LSP MCP servers such as Serena or Bifrost MCP work reliably in RooCode. RooCode sometimes uses them, but most of the time not. So I made those LSP tools an integral part of Zentara, rewrote the system prompt so that it forces a coding agent to use LSP tools.  
The runtime debugging ability has been in Zentara since the beginning, as discussed here:

I hope that this tool will help you in everyday work."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thank you for the opinion. At least I use it  for myself on my everyday work :) to increase my productivity  as I do not understand why some simple features such as LSP symbolic navigation and runtime debugging and no big tech implement those, and I cannot wait for some big tech to do it for me. Or it's just my niche use case as I frequently need to debug very difficult bug and I need to trace the data transformations.   
And I found it much faster than Claude Code.</div>

I saw the hype posts and videos when Nano Banana came out this past week and expected it to really be groundbreaking - in the ways that the hype posts have been suggesting.

Having tested it for several days now, my honest feedback is that it is top of the line at certain tasks - like changing the clothes of characters - but overall the quality...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">​I think you're judging this tool by the wrong standard. The hype isn't coming from graphic designers thinking it will replace Photoshop; it's coming from the 99% of people who have never used Photoshop and now have a powerful tool at their fingertips.

​For that huge audience, the minor artifacts and texture issues you mentioned are a total non-issue. They don't need a final edit, professional-grade output; they just want to be able to make quick, easy changes with a few words. The one valid point you raised is the 50% failure rate, which is a huge bug that needs to be addressed.

​But the hype is justified not because the tool is perfect, but because it's a game changer for a massive, underserved market. It doesn't have to destroy Adobe to be revolutionary.</div>

While they are laughing, you improve the quality and slowly but surely put them out of business.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is why people underestimate AI’s capabilities in every sector, not just design. 

EXPERTS: Ignore this at your peril.

Comparing AI to an expert is always going to make it look “deficient”. But that’s not AI’s value proposition - AI is giving “near-expert,” certainly “good enough” quality tools to the 98% of the population who had 0% expertise in that area before.

People vote with their wallets, and once they realize they can get “good enough” whatever; good enough art, good enough science, good enough engineering, good enough writing, good enough music, good enough porn, for a tenth of the price and a hundredth of the time, and oh yeah they can customize it and get it on demand without having to deal with a slow and stuffy human expert, the 10% between “great” and “good enough” is going to be totally irrelevant.

Saying that AI tools “aren’t there yet” because they don’t match expert level capability in any domain including design (but again also music, engineering, media, marketing, shit you name it) is totally missing the bigger picture of what is happening in society at large. It’s like saying that the Honda Civic isn’t good enough because it’s not a Ferrari. Well, I don’t really need a Ferrari, do I?

This is the DEMOCRATIZATION OF EXPERTISE, and this is not going to make the experts very happy, especially since their work is what was used to give AI systems this capability and put it into users’ hands. But it is what is happening.

Sure maybe Photoshop isn’t “going away” tomorrow because there is still stuff that AI can’t do. But to use that as a psychological shield to say that AI isn’t coming for design work is fatally flawed logic. (I’m not saying that’s what you’re doing OP, I’m just making a larger point lest some people read your post that way.)

The more important point is that AI is making EVERYONE an AMATEUR EVERYTHING. And for the vast majority of needs, amateur skills are good enough, not to mention the huge creative potential this unlocks in smart, capable, driven people who have not previously dabbled or specialized in an area.

The amount of creative energy that AI unlocks in the masses because of its ability to make previously gate-kept fields like design accessible is unprecedented. We have no real reference for it. Even the printing press and the internet “only” gave the public access to the world’s INFORMATION, by comparison, while AI gives the public access to the world’s SKILLS. 

They don’t have to be anywhere near perfect in order to be massively disruptive to the point where the world is unrecognizable after the fact.

Consider this: even if AI never advanced any further than where it is now, if all AI progress stopped in its tracks today, we would still experience massive change in society over the next ten to twenty years. We have only just begun to harness the capability that AI systems give us now.</div>

If you think it’s not better than the competitors, you simply haven’t used it enough. While they have their specific advantages over the model, the general image editing capabilities almost always perform better than the others</div>

Utterly incapable of any critical thinking or reading comprehension. Yes, for many use cases nano banana is significantly worse than ChatGPT. This is not surprising as the GPT image model is a natively multimodal GPT-4o which is far smarter than whatever Google is using to parse the user prompt and send it to the image editor. GPT-4o understands nuances of a text/image prompt much better and it has more world knowledge.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I've tried using it and it is extremely scattershot. It is utterly incapable of doing some of the most basic tasks imagineable but one shots some complex ones. I spent 6 hours trying to get it to change the position of eyes on a character. It could not ever once do it. Restarting new threads, simple prompts, complex prompts, no image reference, a dozen image references, nothing. Moving a few pixels to the left *defeated* and *devastated* this SOTA image tool.

The plus side is that image gen is pissing me off so badly with its incompetence that my own artistic skills are improving more than they have in years; I gave up and did that task myself in 3 minutes, and even did the shading well. It bewildered me how a task even a 1st grader could do in MS Paint is beyond an image editor.... But then it one-shots style transfer + pose reference + complex background requests</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Watch Oliver Stone’s JFK movie. Extremely enlightening. Kennedy was killed by the Feds because he was seen as soft on communism, was de-escalating tensions with Russia, was refusing to attack Vietnam, wanted to downsize the US military &amp; dismantle the intelligence agencies.

Was it the mob or was it the CIA or was it a foreign Nation or was it the Communists or was it the Cubans or was it a single lone gunman or the Russians or did his head just do that spontaneously? 

Even today and in this thread people will disagree.</div>

So I made the dumb joke about "Lucas the prince of darkness," and one of the wives looked at me like she wanted to stab me in the face. She made some remark about Morgan not using Lucas electronics anymore, and I apologized for assuming that British car owners would have a sense of humor.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">To be fair, [around 90% of the code at Anthropic is being written by AI...(Claude Code)](https://xcancel.com/lennysan/status/1930711568385466577)

I find it hard to blame Dario for making a prediction that he sees actively occurring within his own company, even if Anthropic is "ahead of the curve" compared to most other companies in that way. 

It's much better to be overly-cautious about the impacts of AI and potentially be off the mark, compared to being overly unconcerned about the impacts of AI, and end up being wrong.</div>

Hopefully this is a lesson for him that small dopamine hits with an improved model does not mean marketing too much....I'd have to give it to Denis Hassabis who time and again has proven to be the most level headed AI leader out there...despite all the fluffs, he still thinks that AGI/ASI level automation, if we ever have it, is a decade away and cannot be achieved without some intermediate breakthroughs. We have still not found them...</div>

I immediately was like "hold on a minute... that can't possibly be right." Thats 1500 per year, which is nearly 5 per day, every fucking day for 200 years!! That is purposterous. He just said it with the most serious straight face. I knew then big grains of salt are necessary if you're going to enjoy the pod cast, which I haven't for along time.</div>

**You didn't count the kidnappings happening OUTSIDE the ice wall.** It's 999.650 per year to be exact.

Honestly, I’m kinda surprised none of the Flat Earth grifters haven't yet came up with the idea of claiming they ‘live beyond the ice wall’ and sending back anonymous reports about what’s happening out there. How would you even fact-check something completely imaginary and out of view! The perfect grift haha!</div>
