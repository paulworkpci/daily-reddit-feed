But after that I discovered my emptiness and lack of discipline, and I also realized that I'm a dirty person. I take care of my personal hygiene every day more than once, but my apartment is like trash.

                        <div class="comment-body">Oh I’m sorry to hear you’re feeling like this. It definitely sounds like you have some depression likely brought on by phone addiction. I can empathise because I’m feeling exactly the same. Today I had plans to leave the house, go to the gym and run a few errands but I have been so lazy and still not left the house and it’s 4:20pm and I’ve been pretty much on my phone most of the day. I never used to be like this but I got a puppy 18 months ago so I naturally was spending more time in the house because of this and I then have gradually been using my phone more.. and have felt this depression/ laziness creep up on me over the last year.
I’ve been looking into it recently and Smart phone addiction is way more common than we think. They’re designed to give you those little dopamine hits that you should be getting from completing tasks and activities with friends/ family etc. 
Make sure to sure to give yourself compassion and grace as you would a friend.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hmm.. Using a phone is nothing wrong if you were to put it in good use. Like reading up or picking up new skills. Balance is the key. Perhaps u can read up some psychology books and try to find out what makes you feel that your life is miserable.

Everyone lives only once, the most important thing for anyone in my opinion is that you must live the way you want it to be. Ultimately nothing wrong to be sloppy at home and looks well groomed outside. Stop the self criticism and more self love. 

There is no right or wrong in this world and people just love to set a definition for everything. The first word that you wrote "I hate my life....." Maybe you can try with "I am grateful that my life ..." (:</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think I'm in a similar situation. At work I am a well looking person, active, social, communicating a lot, efficient. But at home, I just endlessly procrastinate, constantly browsing youtube, reddit, twitter, instagram and so on, just to not do anything that would at least somehow make my brain work.

Weekends are just a complete failure, I just spend them all in gadgets, endlessly looking for something to entertain myself, watch TV shows, play games, stay on youtube for hours watching all sorts of useless shit.

I literally don't know how to get out of it, I've been setting goals for myself over and over again for years, I've journaled, calendars, todo lists, it's all useless. I don't know what to do about it, how to force myself.

The worst is a phone and laptop with youtubes and other fucking social medias. I just can't get off of this dophamine. I put all sorts of programs to limit the time I spend there, but it's all the same bullshit that I set up for myself and turn off whenever I want.

Today was great weather for a potentially productive Saturday, but I screwed it up like so many before it.</div>

https://x.com/arcprize/status/1890464924075282549

&gt;Inspired by @karpathy's recent tweet - games are a great test environment for AI

&gt;They require:
&gt;• Real-time decisions
&gt;• Multiple objectives
&gt;• Spatial reasoning
&gt;• Dynamic environments

&gt;So we built SnakeBench to explore how LLMs would do

Damn o3-mini and R1 are MUCH better than everyone else, impressed by how many apples o3-mini got. Really excited to see more benchs like this, i assume labs are building tons of benchs like this internally to then train their models with RL against them.

And thats vanilla o3-mini, not even high! https://x.com/GregKamradt/status/1890468362284683656

They used o1-pro to generate the game engine, it one-shotted it https://arcprize.org/blog/snakebench

&gt;o1-pro one shot

&gt;The initial snake game was produced by o1-pro in one shot. It effectively aced the environment's logic during tests, requiring minimal re-prompting of the game engine.

&gt;The prompt used:

&gt;Can you make me a snake game I can play?

&gt;but instead of an automatic timer it is turn based?

&gt;With an arbitrary amount of players, so multiple snakes.

&gt;Each snake will submit a turn they want to do, and then a "round" will happen.

&gt;Make a function that will ask each "player" what move they would like to make.
Multiple LLMs decide where they want to go. I want to make LLMs battle in snake.

&gt;Make the grid size arbitrary too.
I also need a way to replay the game, so make sure to store history state.</div>

Anyway, having read some of the matches and reasoning of various models behind key moves, I see they're all pretty much terrible at this. For example given a choice of eating an apple and a guaranteed death next move or a completely safe way, they go suicidal. Can't even plan 1 turn ahead in most cases.


It all comes up to being trained for similar tasks. If full o3 had none of it, it will likely win but use ridiculous number of thinking tokens per each move.</div>

Even ELON doesn’t fully understand it.

Expect no apologies from anyone, they can all just claim ignorance.  Even Elon said he’ll say things that are wrong and we just need to deal with it.

The trolls love the head troll and act oblivious while they love to drink the tears of people that think maybe people that understand what they are doing should be making the decisions.

Rubio has none of the baggage that almost every other candidate has brought with them.  Hell, even look at Noem.  She's incompetent and not very smart, and some feel that is an issue, but she doesn't have Gabbard, Hegseth, or RFK Jr. level red flags or suspect loyalties.</div>

Exactly. Liberals and progressives might dislike any conservative getting an appointment. However, Rubio might be the least controversial of all the nominees for these positions. 

Dislike his political views all you want, he is very experienced, a ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and generally liked by both sides. 

I'm not saying he's a **good** pick. Just that he's non-controversial.</div>

A vote for Rubio to be confirmed highlights the fact that the other no votes weren't just partisan disagreement, but come from a legitimate concern toward the damage those nominees might do regardless of party affiliation. Massive incentive to vote for Rubio that isn't usually there under normal circumstances.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Im 25 so a bit older gen Z. Fortunately people around my age are not THAT into internet culture. Some are and having conversations with them is impossible, its all internet jokes and reference that i dont get (been off most socials since 2019). But im still glad i got a bunch of friends who would perk up on mentions of hiking or sports, tho most of us are busy in our newly acquired jobs so we rarely meet.

I think it helps that we did experience some part of our childhood without the internet. I remember getting on facebook and youtube when i was 11 but it was still a rare thing and it was actually social media back then unlike now. So when it all became a mess and algorithm driven it was noticeable (at least to me). I think it all comes down to that are people around you aware of what social media is doing to them?</div>

Things that took years to develop and change are now changing monthly. 5-10 years is my timeline when you will see people start to panic.

                                <div class="reply-body">You are one of very few people who are thinking properly. People claim AI is different from human intelligence, or it will create new jobs. It won't create new jobs (after a point) because any job it creates will be doable by AI agents too. Also, artificial neurons are essentially performing the same task our brains perform. Only difference is in efficiency. Our brains spend 3 watts while AI spends 3000 watts, but that is just an engineering challenge which will improve over time. In conclusion, we are all cooked. We should all make our money while we can. I secretly hope that some movement or uprising occurs to slow down this process. I understand that old and rich people want to accelerate it in hopes that AI creates a age-reversing cure or immortality. But this incentive will drive income inequality to unprecedented levels, creating a dystopia. UBI also doesn't seem practical without a one-world government, otherwise the investors move to another country. Man, we are playing with fire..</div>

Joe relentlessly praises an oligarch and a smaller more idiotic oligarch on almost every podcast episode since the election. Shit is annoying.

                        <div class="comment-body">Hearing Joe speak on anything political these days is painful. He makes "mistakes" like this all the time. It's almost as if he doesn't think even one step beyond what he says, but instead just, I imagine, parrots something he heard. These opinions can't be the result of logical thought, because they wouldn't stand up to a moment of reflection. They have to come from somewhere and be repeated.

Even one moment of thought, as presented in this video, could debunk much of what he says. And the guests never push back or question anything at all, they just agree agree agree.</div>

Joe and others who agree liking the people involved doesn’t change that fact. 

If there’s no doubt in anyone’s mind that Elon’s access is a result of his financial support of a politician, it’s corruption, plain and simple. He bought power. Joe has never been incredibly intelligent, but he was curious and objective enough to have realized that before. 

It’s wild to me that he can’t remove his personal feelings from the situation enough to see that he’s arguing for and against something in the same statement.</div>

Being on your phone distracts you from those feelings and gives you free, constant cheap dopamine (while it makes it worse). Examine what is causing the need of the constant avoid of what you're feeling, try some meditation, and you deal with that.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">What if you try a gradual decrease? If you spend 9 hrs a day, try to do 8 max this week. Be strict and don’t go above 8, but don’t pressure yourself to do less. Then do 7 the next week, and continue on from there. Don’t force yourself to go lower than you need to for the week so you don’t relapse. Watch your screen time and track it.   You could also try to do a short trip that’s phoneless, like camping. It could even be like 2-3 days but somewhere you have little to no service. It could help your brain detox/detach from the phone so it can see the possibilities. Think of it like a reset that can give you a taste of what your life could be like when you’re free from the habit.</div>

That’s what I thought about this too. The US has used the guise of terrorism to cause terror all over the world. 

Which creates extremism in those countries. Then that creates actual “terrorists” 

Personally I’m not even sure we can call them terrorists anymore. 

Imagine growing up in a small town, you walk to the market and just as you get on your street a drone you can’t see or hear drops a bomb on your families home- you see them die. 

That guy isn’t exactly a nasty terrorist for wanting revenge on our country. And the only way to hit a country like ours when you’re poor is to engage in dirty warfare.

Edit: remember if we need to use our second amendment we will be labeled as terrorists until we win</div>

Writing code in 30s by an Ai datacenter is way more efficient than spending 4 hours of electricity on your home computer. That's a small scale example.

He needs his companies and he needs the US treasury and he needs competitors... and he wants future payment systems to go through X and on and on.

                        <div class="comment-body">I'll never forget one night years ago while installing a WIM station in VA with a lane closure. Around 2 AM a motorist came flying into my work zone yelling that one of the crew must have got hit because they were lying in the grass median at the start of the work zone (couple hundred feet from where we were)

All hands on deck moment as we rushed back to investigate. Turns out it was an elderly man in high visibility sneakers and vest who had fallen down in the wet grass in the median and couldn't get up.

We got the local police to show up and here's the kicker. The cop informed us that this man "escapes" the old folks home and goes on late night walkabouts. Apparently he does it so often that the staff just starting putting a vest in his room so he would at least be safe.

Smart? Sure, probably saved his life more than a few times. But why not just beef up staff or secure your facility? The elderly guy had no idea who he was and could not form a cogent sentence when were helping him.

I looked up the old folks home the next day on Google amd was amazed to find out that it was about 8 miles from where we found him.</div>

Because they can barely hire enough staff to do the minimum. Doesn't help that it's thankless work for minimum wage, so that the only applicants are saints or people who couldn't hack it at McDonald's.</div>

I forgot to add why I personally think this case is important;

With all the recent intrusions by quote on quote,”drones”, it’s important to look back on events like these. This isn’t just a recent thing. This has happened before in history. This event took place almost 20 years ago over restricted airspace in one of the busiest airports in the world just five years after 9/11. Thank you for reading as always.

                                <div class="reply-body">In my opinion OP this case is one of those classic UFO stories that sounds compelling until you dig deeper. Yes airport employees reported seeing something, but eyewitness accounts alone don’t prove anything extraordinary. The FAA dismissing it as a “hole punch cloud” makes sense because those clouds can look unusual, and memory is fallible, especially in a fast-moving, high-pressure work environment. The idea that people were “too scared to report it” is just another excuse for the lack of solid evidence. If something truly anomalous was hovering over one of the busiest airports in the world, where’s the clear video, radar confirmation, or anything beyond secondhand stories? I think you know the answer!!</div>

I was part of the Green Day fandom from 2018 to 2023. I know that many people in this subreddit were/are active on social media, and experienced a band and/or celebrity through that lens. I was the same way until I left social media in 2024 due to negative experiences in the fandom and personal mental health struggles. I don’t see myself returning, and looking back, there’s some advice I wish I had taken sooner. I’m sharing this not to make anyone feel negative or belittled but to...</div>

We didn’t have Green Day message boards, but I would buy tons of magazines, plaster my walls by every cassette and CD and tape everything that was playing on Much Music (canadas mtv when mtv actually played music videos). It was actually my earliest memories of experiencing Limerence and obsession , and it was same for Nirvana and Kurt. I’m so glad there wasn’t social media like today I think I would have been the most unhinged person</div>

I do value older technology and other means of listening to music. I feel like if you separate the artist and the music itself it makes you appreciate it more. With about every band that I have listened to, I've gotten obsessed and experienced limerence similar to you. I saw them in July of 2021 during Hella Mega. I was glad I wasn't on social much at the time and I took it in.</div>

Now I just listen to their music when I want and don't worry about following every little thing they do online. Made me enjoy the band more tbh. Sometimes u just gotta step back and remember its just music at the end of the day</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I had a similar but almost opposite thing. I got really heavily obsessed with a slightly obscure singer but the online part of it made it great. I got to be an editor on Genius because I worked so hard on sorting out their pages. I messaged back and forth with other fans, one of whom I ended up going to a music festival with. I still go to that festival regularly and it’s the highlight of my year. I set up an instagram fan page and it got popular enough that I got a hundred or so likes for every post. Which made me happy at the time. I even got to meet the singer.
I kind of lost interest in the end but it was pretty fun while it lasted. Obsession isn’t great but the more outward focussed you can make it the better. Especially if you find a positive group of people to interact with. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Very true and I'm going through this as well with the smaller artist who's in Green Day circle. During 2023, I was listening to his music because he was releasing his new project. I gotten hyper-fixated on a lot of his older music, and I checked out a lot of things. I was even connected to him via social media until I went offline. I feel like once you take a step back it helps you look at your problems in a different way. It makes you understand things from other people's perspectives, understand your flaws, and work on them.</div>
