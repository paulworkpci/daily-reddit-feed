Two days ago at work, I was listening to some motivational video and algorithm took me to a meditation video. Not a guided meditation, but a video explaining how meditation works.

I was not really paying attention, but it just hit me.

I felt disconnected from my surroundings. My observations were sharper. I coul...</div>

I wanted to try Codex CLI, so I bought API credit only to find out, with Tier 1 it's totally unusable.

It's usable with ChatGPT Plus subscription, so I gave it a try.

It was wonderful! Truly joyful vibe coding. Noticeable upgrade from Claude Code (Sonnet 4).

And **it's over** now. **After 2 days** since I activated my subscription.  
As you can see in picture, I **...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Seems a little fishy to me. I had some days although not recently where I hit the daily limit. At that time it didn’t say when it would reset. I’m in plus btw. 

But, I got a fair amount of usage out of it and it was on medium by default. So I’m not sure how you could have hit the limits so fast. 

Additionally, there was a post the other day that they had increased the limits for plus and other account types I think by 50%. 

I also have a Claude max sub but I’ll probably be doing some work soon in codex and I’ll see how much usage I’m able to get without it cutting me off. </div>

There's no public info about weekly limit, we just know there's some but don't know much about it.

And I was using it on low reasoning effort. Not even that often, I'm not a power user...

It doesn't add up.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">PRO - It is virtually unlimited. I can sit there pumping out task after task all day long and I usually get one warning I ran out of tasks and it will reset in anywhere from 10-30 minutes.

It is also getting better. The new upgrade yesterday in cloud codex now adds comments on github after the task warning me of issues that will also need to be addressed. I wish it just created the task and fixed that but its very careful about PR.

Claude on the other hand does 30 minutes of coding of Sonnet on the low tier and says, retry in 5 hours after it edits and fixes an error in a file that is just 1000 lines of coding. When I have it code it fixes one thing and breaks another. I go full circle jerk vibe coding and burn up everything.

The solution has been using gpt5 thinking in chat to find the fix and both Grok4 and Opus go - that solution is better than what I came up with.... Grok 4 limits are quite high so I can't wait until they figure out a way to easily export code.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">well yeaaah but... First I wanted to try it and 2 days just isn't enough.

Here me out, this is my experience:

* I bought API credit to test Codex CLI because I've heard good reviews on it
* I hit TPM limit in first or second message with API token because there's Tier 1 with tight limits
* ok, the credit will go to waste if I can't use it, stupid
* 2 days later I cooled off and subscribed to Plus plan to use Codex CLI with it
* I set reasoning effort to low to not overconsume quota
* I hit weekly limit in like 2 days

I'd give PRO a chance but after these many failures? It's hard to justify</div>

Here, these are my sessions since I subscribed to Plus plan and in first column there's number of messages in each session.

The more I'm digging into this, the more frustrated I get because I really didn't use it that much.

I just started exploring ChatGPT ecosystem. It started with Codex CLI, but I was beginning to like OpenAI again for other features it offers on the web that I might try... Well... It didn't last long and now I feel more like scammed than a good spend of my money.</div>

I would happily pay $50 for a plan that has more Codex-focused availability while keeping the same chat availability.

Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu

Local tasks: Average users can send 30-150 messages every 5 hours with a weekly limit.

Cloud tasks: Generous limits for a limited time.

Usage limits for codex is same with plus and teams.

It builds bonds, loyalty, and strengthens efficiency, but most importantly, it empowers all to achieve greater goals.

I am Australian. Culture and systems definitely play a role in viewpoint.   
  
I have also never worked in a full corporate position. All of my professional experience has been in roles and organisations that I am passionate about. I am lucky that I have the opportunity to be selective - I have never "worked for a paycheck", and that plays a role in how I view my value. If you can, reframe how you see it. 

All the best.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">While Codex CLI, for the moment, lacks the nice UI and feature set that Claude Code has, Codex CLI has in my opinion so far avoided doing extra things I didn't ask Claude Code to do. It won't blindly agree with me e.g. you're absolutely right, and usually will give me a pros/cons kind of discussion first if one is warranted. It's not overly eager at jumping straight into doing something if there are serious things to consider first. It appears to more consistently stick to the existing patterns in the codebase. It simply does what I ask and no more than that, with some follow up questions or opportunities for me.

Overall, so far, I'm impressed with Codex CLI. I've used Claude Code on Max 20x for possibly 2-3 months. Don't get me wrong, Claude Code is still amazing, but I may downgrade and continue using Codex CLI more if it continues to impress me.

What I feel we currently have is one product which has an excellent UI and feature set, but a model that has some flaws and needs a bit of babysitting to stop it wandering too far off course, and on the other hand we have a product that's bland and somewhat basic, but a model which doesn't blindly agree with me, doesn't do things I didn't ask it to do on a regular basis, and overall sticks to what I wanted with a much higher context limit. I'm not finding myself having to compact or start a new conversation regularly unlike in Claude Code currently.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The approval for making edits is busted on windows and it will always ask. 

Fortunately the CLI is open source. I actually used codex to fix its own bug, just told it that windows approval doesn’t appear to work properly and it found the issue and fixed it.

I then recompiled it and then set it up as a custom CLI in the codex extension settings for vs code and now it works as expected, no more annoying approval prompts when set to full auto

                                <div class="reply-body">That’s not the issue.

The Emira sold more cars in 3 years (over 10K) than the Evora did in the entire 11 model year run (just over 6K). Deliveries to the US have now been halted due to tariffs, so there’s additional pressure that wasn’t there in 2024. With 25% added I don’t think it would be very competitive unfortunately, that’s loaded Z06 or Cayman GTS 4.0 money. 

Seems obvious the main issue from a product perspective is the Eletre not doing well, + their insane projections of 70K+ cars sold in 2025 per their IPO.</div>

Clinics are messy—symptoms conflict, data is missing, risks and side-effects have to be weighed, and someone has to be accountable. If it’s really “better than doctors,” show a live trial where it reduces misdiagnoses, speeds the right treatment, and avoids harm. Until then, it’s a strong copilot for chart summaries, guideline look-ups, and patient letters—humans still make the call.</div>

Also, show me the LLM that can perform a physical exam. If you can't elicit reflexes or palpate an acute abdomen, then there is nothing superhuman about your overall performance in practicing medicine.</div>

Passing the buck to dad, fans on the stream, other wrestlers.... There has to be accountability here. He's a 25 year old man.

As far as this interaction, even at the most liberal interpretation never could it be construed as 'Go and kill this dude..."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah just yesterday I found myself watching wrestling videos on what "giving receipts" means. It's basically when a wrestler is going a little too hard, the other wrestler on the receiving end of it gives them one or two hard shots back. A way of telling them to settle down a bit without breaking character, and keeping the show going. There's no way he was telling Raja he could go in there and beat the living fuck out of the dude.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">They are both ridiculous but AJ being blamed for this is also puzzling to me as well. The dude didn't force Raja to do anything. Raja is a grown adult capable of making his own decisions and so I guess for this guy to lose his job, wrestling, etc is kinda too much if I'm being honest. I get that this wrestling club didn't want him anymore, and that's understandable but dude is going to be black listed for any kind of wrestling event.

It's probably going to be tough for him to even get a job for just being associated with Raja because this story will follow him everywhere for a very long time. 

I think this day and age we are so willing and okay with destroying people's lives so quickly and don't care about the fallout because "fuck em". Raja is solely to blame for this, as well as his own father imo</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think Genie is an example of this specific medium quickly reaching the current frontier of neural networks, rather than an example of progress past the frontier.

Language, audio, and images were the first medium to fully utilize neural networks, then video reached the same parity, now world models have caught up.

So I think it's more that current neural network technologies are being fully applied to different contexts and not that these contexts themselves are experiencing exponential progress beyond it.</div>

We are brand new at this workflow. It will take adjustment. We have to build pipelines that didn't exist.

The most common use case for the Realtime API is to build a real-time, speech-to-speech, conversational experience. This is great for building voice agents and other voice-enabled applications.

The Realtime API can also be used independently for transcription and turn detection use cases. A client can stream audio in and have Realtime API produce streaming transcripts when speech is detected.</div>

I wonder why.

"Kill Trump" and his trans footage (old video) will have MAGA ppl thinking "liberal".

Then he mixed in some antisemitism (jew gas), the N word and something about latinos, which will have liberals screaming "Nazi".

Then dude added Russian shit, and Celtic symbolism. The weapons also say "Mashallah" and Breivik, etc🤪.

**It's a clever tactic because most ppl will latch on to the message that suits their world image and blame it on their favorite scapegoat💀☠️.** Dude became the embodiment of Chaotic Evil. Stirring the pot.</div>

Aside from looking great (you do!) and your clothes fitting comfortably for a change (I bet that feels amazing) you're saving yourself from crippling pain in your later years.

There was a weirdness, a sort of "essential" charm to the way those old, ugly models generated images in a way that was felt like...

How long it'd take AI researchers to actually build out something from that with the full suite of humanish capabilities, I can only speculate and guess.

Granted, vibes-based forecasting is a lot more entertaining than my boring cold emotionless numbers nonsense. Shapiro has to generate content; imagine how boring my forecasting youtube channel would be.

Like one video that's like '100k GB200 is probably around human scale.' Followed up by massive speculation on what it would *really* mean to have a virtual person in a datacenter running at 2 Ghz.</div>

But anyway hardware aside, 99% the robotic AI is what counts. I'm not sure if I see a clear winner, there. Arguably, Figure might be ahead with their AI. Boston Dynamics, certainly not.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This fucking loser was terminally online and wrote stupid shit all over their guns and mags from** "Get clapped" to "where is your god now?" "6 million wasn't enough" and other cringy shit. This absolute pile of shit got ramped the fuck up from social media until they snapped and killed two kids. 

If you read their "manifesto" they did this because they self diagnosed themselves with lung cancer because they FELT like they had it based on the pains they were getting and they knew those pains meant no return and they didn't want to "rot as a cancer patient" so they did this final act that they had been thinking about for years. Didn't even see a doctor or anything just said, "Yup. Gonna do this" 

Then when the cops show up, ready to take them in they corner themselves and take their own life like the fucking coward that they are. Don't even bury this shitbag in a marked grave and don't show them an ounce of kindness when you speak of them.

To add** For the ones asking "why use they" its fairly simple and definitely wasn't done out of respect. At the time this was posted I didn't know what this piece of shit was and didn't care enough to find out because I'm not wasting time on that and left it at they because I don't give a fuck about the dirtbag.</div>

 I feel like most people aren't trying hard enough.  That's why when I join the oligarchy I will enforce long hours and eliminate weekends.  I will come up with random ideas, describe myself as a visionary and sack anyone who can't deliver my absurd whims within a week.  It's good that the government is helping people like me.</div>
