(0: care to know how to format Reddit comments). 
	1.	How to Debug – If you can’t trace logs, read stack traces, or isolate problems, you’re just pasting errors into a chatbot.
	2.	Core Programming Concepts – Loops, conditionals, recursion, data types. If these aren’t second nature, you won’t understand what AI is giving you.
	3.	Version Control (Git) – If you don’t know how to branch, merge, or revert, you’ll wreck your project the first time Copilot suggests something broken.
	4.	How to Read Documentation – AI will hallucinate; docs don’t. You need to verify and understand what’s real.
	5.	How to Ask Good Questions – AI is only as helpful as your input is specific. Vague prompts = vague garbage.
	6.	Security Basics – You need to spot when AI suggests something dangerously insecure (e.g., unsanitized SQL, hardcoded secrets).
	7.	Command Line Basics – If AI says “run this command,” you should know what it does before typing it in.
	8.	How to Google – Yes, even with AI. Knowing what to search for and how to filter answers is still critical.
	9.	How to Test Code – Unit tests, integration tests, manual testing workflows — AI won’t run your tests for you.
	10.	Architecture and Tradeoffs – Just because AI can code it doesn’t mean it should. Performance, cost, readability — all still your responsibility.
	11.	What “Good Code” Looks Like – Legible, maintainable, documented. AI often writes just-good-enough code. You still have to refine.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Right.  If you can architect, then AI is nothing short of amazing because it eliminates these giant problems all architects have suffered through in one mixture or another:

\- Frequent repetitive Stack Overflow posts with long async delays just to discover some library update, or parameter tweak, or other deeply frustrating piece of arcane knowledge you didn't have and isn't the kind of thing you could "reason out".  More like not knowing the combination to a combination lock, that literally locked you out of progressing with your project.

\- Similar to above but more generally, AI frees you from excessive domain specific knowledge in a specific programming language, library or framework.  Anyone who hits the 7 programming languages or more count, where most of them are all procedural languages, will know the aggravation of trying to remember yet another different way to express a damn loop.

\- And finally, that grumpy devops person (can't really blame them), junior dev or UX designer, etc.  you had to wait for to chunk out a bunch of simple low level code that you don't know how to do, or don't have time to do

For the architect, despite the fear that AI will someday catch up to them, it's a *very* happy day!</div>

It’s still really hard to build a big project. I’m a SWE at a FANG company, and for the first time, I felt like something might be shifting. But after spending more time with it, things started to get stuck. So I dove into the code (vibe-coded), and it was just tough to work with. changes required a ton of refactoring just to make it human readable. Everything was crammed into one file to catch basic build errors, and the typing was super odd. I’d even written a design doc and PRD ahead of time, so it had gotten decently far.

My takeaway is that what used to be teams of 5 will become teams of 1–2 with tools like Claude Code. Engineers who can think top-down—really take an architectural view—are the ones who’ll thrive. They’ll become more like software architects, tackling niche problems, system design, and connecting everything together. That’s essentially what an L5+ engineer does where I’m at.

That said, I’ve seen systems built by L6+ engineers that AI just couldn’t dream up yet. That’s where we’re still a ways off from full AI replacement. But things are definitely changing. I see this role evolving into something more like a traditional architect, more specialized education and fewer people doing the job.</div>

"researchers are proposing a solution to a key hurdle in quantum networking: a device that can "translate" microwave to optical signals and vice versa.

The technology could serve as a universal translator for quantum computers—enabling them to talk to one another over long distances and converting up to 95% of a signal with vi...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.</div>

But it’s actually harder and requires more cognitive load compared to writing it myself. It is way faster though.  I have 15+ YOE, so I can manage just fine but I really feel like at its current level it’s just a trap for mediors and juniors. 

So, why is it harder? Because you need to be very good at hardest parts of programming - defining strictly and in advance what you need to do, understanding and reviewing code that wasn’t written by you.   

At least for now AI is really shit at just goi...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Personally, it is a really good thing for senior developers. Many junior developers are just never going to be as good because they will depend on AI too much.

Those Juniors will just end up being paid very little and never get anywhere because they are basically just consumers of AI tools at that point.

Like someone never learning how to multiply because a calculator can do it for you. That will eventually prevent you from becoming a great mathematician because you will eventually need to know things like that.

Or a researcher who only ever uses Wikipedia.</div>

'I need this feature' and Ai will figure out the specs, will figure out how to translate it into a proper architecture that fits the current code base. For now these higher level skills are valuable. My feeling is that theyll eventually be absorbed by AI too.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It is more that they will just skip hiring juniors and just have seniors use AI instead.

Juniors will slowly become like mathematicians who do not even know how long division works because they can just use a calculator.  

So they will become increasingly burdensome and a net negative to the company while they demand ever higher wages without realizing that if they are just a promoter, they have made themselves completely replaceable. Especially since many feel they are owed a 100,000+ job at Google and think they are way better then senior devs because senior devs are older.

Tech will keep improving, resulting in less need for juniors until just moslty seniors are left around until retirement. New people who enter the field will be paid way less with time.

Kind of like GM. The retirees are not being replaced or are replaced by people paid waaaay less. Because the robots will just improve to the point that they do not need the same skill. The only reason the older workers are paid as much as they are is because they are kept around for the transition.</div>

Not to say it's not possible, but make sure you evaluate these types of statements critically.</div>

"A source familiar with the discussions, granted anonymity to speak freely about the negotiations, says OpenAI is fairly close to achieving AGI; Altman has said he expects to see it during Donald Trump’s current term."

If this is true, it looks like we might see some huge advancements in models and agents soon.

                                <div class="reply-body">Lots of "big if true" moments here. Given how every single public statement from an OpenAI employee seems to be directed at artificially inflating (AI, get it?) OpenAI's reputation by hinting at "you wouldn't believe what we're finding" (true Trump fashion), I don't think this is anything but another attempt to mislead the public.

Anyone even remotely familiar with both contract law and Microsoft should immediately see the red flags. Why would MS and OpenAI agree to such a clause, and why is is formulated so vaguely?

Easy.

1. MS could always go to court claiming the clause is void because it is too vague.
2. OpenAI could always \*pretend\* they have AGI and that its release is just being held up by legal issues with MS.
3. MS could always conspire with OpenAI to mislead investors on what exactly either party does or does not control. "Why invest another $200 billion into company A when AGI exists and MS is close to controlling it, and therefore is the one we should partner with?"</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Problem is we're only getting paraphrasing from anonymous sources, there isn't much detail. "OpenAI thinks AGI is close" is public information, and the fact their board has a lot of freedom in how it defines AGi kind of muddies everything up. The article quotes an"AI coding agent that exceeds the capabilities of an advanced human programmer" as a possible metric floated by the execs, but even that metric is strange considering they already celebrate o3 being a top elite competitive programmer. Especially the way they talk about o3 publicly is like it's already the AGI they all expected.

**Edit**: The article actually touches on an internal 5-levels of AGI within OpenAI that reportedly would've made it harder for them to declare AGI, since it'd have to be based on better definitions than whatever free hand the board currently has.

Still, not much to update from here, sources are anonymous and we don't get much detail. Waiting on Grok 4 (yes, any big release is an update) but mostly GPT-5 especially for the agentic stuff,</div>

It would appear 4 of them left Google to join OpenAI in December 2024. 

2 of them left Google to join OpenAI in March and September 2024. 

2 of them have been at OpenAI since 2022.

Maybe they didn’t like OpenAI culture and the Meta offer was too good to pass up?  Pending on what the other 2 worked on they seem like the biggest loss.  I’m sure OpenAI is glad the ones they poached went to Meta instead of back to Google.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's both. OpenAI has been having an insane talent bleed ever since Anthropic split off from them, they have never been the same.

Just to give you some indication ChatGPT and GPT-4 were both designed by the people that eventually became Anthropic. Those 2 models are the best OpenAI has ever made and they have underperformed ever since.

Everyone in the industry realizes OpenAI is a sinking ship. The only thing OpenAI has is a large userbase which they hope to capitalize on.

Meanwhile everyone and their dog wants to work at Anthropic. DeepMind and OpenAI lose a significant portion of their talent to Anthropic every quarter.

For outsiders this isn't very clear but Anthropic is head and shoulders above the others in terms of respectability. As it's the only lab out there that genuinely tries to understand what LLMs actually are, how they actually work and bringing fundamental theory up to snuff. This is catnip for AI researchers.

DeepMind is also a respectable place as long as you're a RL specialist. They have the best RL talent bar none, which isn't that crazy as they were essentially founded around RL and have spearheaded this field for a decade+

OpenAI treated mechinterp as a joke, meanwhile Anthropic found out how hallucination works through mechinterp which will pay an insane dividend.

Most labs are chasing benchmarks. Meanwhile anyone that actually uses these models in practice knows that Anthropic simply has the most intelligent models, benchmarks be damned.</div>

At this point, you'd stay with OpenAI because it's the winning team, and that's not ideological.

Today I walked in and put my stuff down on one spot…then a guy just set his stuff down too and claimed it so I moved over. Then a girl walks in and starts adjusting the rack where I have my stuff.

Never heard of a limit of one person per rack, especially when there are only seven.

Sounds like a culture issue.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Normally isn’t an issue during my barbell class because it’s so small but when we work from blocks we have to share. We a barbell and swap the weights out. It’s really nice because it gives you a chance to work with a partner who can give you feedback and also someone who can help you rerack the weights. 

In my regular CrossFit class space can be an issue but we all try so hard to make space for everyone and I feel like everyone is so nice about it. I absolutely would not clean all your lifts from the floor. It will severely limit how much you can lift and you’re setting yourself up for injury. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Based on my observations through the webcams and input from some photographer friends, I can say…

They went to the Nürburgring on both June 24th and 27th.

On June 24th, the weather was excellent. They ran multiple sessions between 8 AM and 12 PM. It was a perfect window to go for a record lap, but it seems they were mainly analyzing data and testing setups.

On June 27th, which I believe was the actual record attempt day, it rained in the morning, so no tests were done early on. However, by around 2:30 PM, the track had nearly dried, and they managed to get some runs in. Still, the day wasn’t ideal for setting the best possible time.

From the teaser video, it’s likely the record lap happened on the 27th—based on the cloud patterns seen in the background. Hopefully, they were able to extract the maximum performance despite the suboptimal conditions.​

                                <div class="reply-body">Setting an actual lap time is not possible during standard industry pool hours as a portion of the track near the paddock is a slow zone for safety. They will typically rent time at the end of the standard industry pool hours just before tf and have enough time for one to two laps unobstructed by other manufacturers. They can spend more for more time but typically do not as the cost can be very high. So if any attempt was made based on this information it would have been late afternoon on the 27th.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">One thing is clear. They ran a time they were happy with. Chevy doesn’t release times (so there would be no teaser) if they aren’t happy with the result. So I think it’s safe to assume a sub 6:45 lap time was achieved. We’ll just have to see how much faster they were able to go.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Chevy already made a record attempt with the Z06 a few years ago. They managed a 7:09 or 7:14 or something like that. The car’s gearing is too long for that track and it loses major time on the high speed sections. It does fantastic on lower speed tracks where it spends its time in gears 1-3, but the Ring uses lots of 4th gear which is quite long (and slow) in the Z06.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hey everyone,

I’ve been dealing with porn addiction for about five years now. It’s something I’ve tried to stop multiple times, but it always pulls me back in. Trying to fight it or willpower doesn’t work. I want to actually heal whatever is underneath it.

That’s why I’m turning to meditation and energy work.

I’ve heard that working with the chakras might help with addictive patterns, but I’m not sure where to start. If anyone here has used chakra meditation or any other type of meditation to...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hello mate, good lad.

I have been meditating for about 8 years, M24, and of course have watched porn over the years.

Another way that I have helped it is not having any devices in my room when I sleep. A bit of environment design goes a long way.

In terms of meditation, it is all about catching the urge and pull when it starts and not letting it take you. This comes with knowing how to ground your self with breath etc.

You then want to hold the urge and give it love and accept it. Feel the urge fully without letting yourself identify with it.

Do not try and get rid of it or push it away as this can just push it down and it comes down later. However I also sometime find when you become aware of the urge, you can quickly get up and do something like going outside for a walk. Something that is hard to watch porn while doing.

Also cutting out all the soft porn on social media etc. This may involve deleting some socials?

You need to find the balance of feeling it fully, accepting, and surrendering to the urge to watch porn, without actually letting it control your behaviour.

Get to know the feeling of wanting to watch porn. Observe it with complete equanimity. Do not react, but give it your whole attention.

This may sound confusing I know. It takes practice for you to understand it in your own way.

Good luck. It’s a hard thing to do. But as we all know, it’s very important.</div>

it was when i figured that out that i didn’t need it anymore. hope this helps.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey, what I recommend is letting yourself masturbate as much as you want, but without any porn / visual stimuli. 

This way you get the high / hit you were looking for, but without the negative conditioning. 

This was my way of learning to stop watching and interacting with porn and soft porn. You learn to drop the guilt by not watching, while still getting what you were looking for. Letting go of masturbation is a different issue but for now, letting go of porn is more important. You feel better, and you can start to cultivate values in your life.

Please do try this, it was a very small change in mindset that changed things for me. Love to hear everyone's thoughts</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">correct, I think this is pretty much what OP means, a human is very likely to still be moving the mouse as they click the box, causing a sort of "drag and drop" scenario.

I always do it like you said, in a "clumsy" manner so it knows I am a human, unfortunately it is soon becoming more likely that AI will begin to use this tactic.

I use automation scripting languages (AutoIt for PC and Tasker for Android) to simulate this with pretty good success rates.</div>

The microwave is convenient, sure, but it turns texture into mush and dries things out from the inside out. Instead: Use a skillet or nonstick pan. Add a splash of water, broth, or a tiny bit of oil (depending on the food), toss a lid on if needed, and reheat gently over medium heat.

Agree with the OP in general, but there is a LOT to be said for using lower power settings on a microwave with longer times to achieve a MUCH better overall heat all the time.
