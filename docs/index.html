I designed it mainly for myself, and especially around 360° scenes. You can load panoramas, freely look around, and place interactive hotspots directly inside the sphere.

Nearly two decades ago, I made a photography-based point &amp; click adventure with [Adventure Maker](https://www.adventuremaker.com/), which is still around, but seemingly still the same application it was back then, with even the website looking exactly the same as it did back in the day.

I think a standout feature would be the built-in ability to create animations from images or to modify them with video gen/image gen, as of course back then, everything needed to be done physically when working with photos if realism was the goal.</div>

You just learned the most important lesson in software: Scope is hard. Really hard. This is the fundamental lesson the entire concept of lean-agile is based on.

You just need to decide what you really want to do, and no one can make that choice for you. Either this is the side quest, or it's the main quest. Once you decide what you want to do, put laser focus on distilling what viable version of that thing is.

This is exactly what makes doing complicated things hard. Too many side quests, and you start burning out as the original visions stack up and fail to come to fruition.

Lowering the price of a 30k$ car by 500$. Almost all car buyers are payment shoppers, so we are talking about like 3$ less per month. Still priced higher than dealerships

On the other hand, they pay more for used cars than dealerships - when I bought a new car, my dealer couldn't match Carmax's offer on a trade-in, even after taking into account the the 8% sales tax savings. I got an extra $4K in my pocket by spending 15 minutes selling my car at Carmax -- took my car dealer longer than that to even give me a price for my car while Carmax gave me a price online.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It is priced higher than dealerships but the thing with carmax is you know exactly what you're getting as far as the price of the car and the warranty coverage and all of that. It can pick and choose. There's no pressure or hassle so to speak, there's literally no haggling allowed- what you see is what you get.

For some people, like myself that might be worth paying the premium over a dealership. The bumper to bumper warranty is famously well honored. That too is worth some consideration. It's not always about the rock bottom bottom dollar price you can get for a car.</div>

If they cut prices and hold the line on everything else, I think they will be pretty successful at increasing volume.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Better than average is debatable. I worked there for a quick minute and saw some questionable cars. We would put lipstick on a pig a lot of the time. The oldest cars they’ll sell are 14 years old because that’s when maintenance really starts to snowball. 

I’d see tires with cracks and expired date codes that they’d just sell as-is despite strongly recommending they changed the tires. I remember a Fiata transfer that had the craziest rod knock I’d ever experienced. Thing was wild. I immediately made a note for the techs that the engine was cooked. They didn’t even put it on a lift when they started it, just wrote the thing off because the cost to repair was too high. They’ll barely change cabin or intake air filters without a customer request, and even that takes pulling teeth. I remember seeing an intake filter so bad it was crazy if air could even get through the debris. I’ve seen crazy oil leaks that looked that front/rear main seals and valve cover gaskets disintegrated. 

Definitely helps to know what to look for when you go there. I’m not surprised many people have had issues with cars right off the lot.</div>

I bought my jag last year and when I got home that night (bought the car at night) it was missing lugnuts, had different brand tires on an AWD car, and the car was absolutely filthy (can't give CarMax too much shit here, I bought a Porsche from a Porsche dealer that gave me a car that was disgusting). I called the service manager the following day fully ready to bring the car back and he apologized and said go to jag and have them do a full inspection. I did that a few days later and CarMax replaced all four tires, brakes, and gave me a $300 credit for detailing. It wasn't great but they made it right.</div>

Try placing one small enjoyable thing before or during your day. 

A favorite snack you usually save for later.

A few pages of something you love. 

Music you normally only play at night. 

A quiet coffee you actually enjoy. 

Stepping outside just to feel the sun. 

Enjoyment does not have to be earned at the end. When it is delayed too long, it often disappears.</div>

On November 15, 2007, Mark Twight [posted](https://web.archive.org/web/20090906123220/http://www.gymjones.com/schedule.php?date=20071115) a workout called 300FY on the daily programming for his gym, [Gym Jones](https://gymjones.com/). The workout was simple: 300 calories in 10 minutes on the Schwinn AirDyne bike.  Frustrated with the YouTube masses making a mockery of one of the published workouts used in training for 2006's "300" movie, Mark proposed an absolutely brutal workout that c...</div>

I love that you broke down all the different bikes used over time. I discovered Hamish Bond on instagram and he is amazing. Did you catch the recent ski-erg marathon world record performance? I don’t remember the guys name but he could probably put up something stout. I hope your post generates an old school whiteboard contest of sorts on this page.

                                <div class="reply-body">Glad you enjoyed! I did see that, Jonas Nielsen did a marathon (42,195m) ski erg in 2:27:14, holding a 1:44.6 500m split for over two hours. Nauseating. He definitely has the heart and lungs for it, but peripheral adaptations (i.e. the muscles doing the work) matter a lot for conditioning, and I'd expect his legs are nowhere near as developed for power as his upper body since the ski erg is so dominated by the lats/triceps/abs. I'm sure he'd do something very respectable, but maybe not top tier. Who knows though?

I'd love a whiteboard contest, everyone should feel free to post their best scores in reply to this comment! I'm just an average fitness nerd, no particular competitive aspirations or history and never been anything special athletically, my best 10-minute score is 180 cals on the Assault Bike Classic (age 38).</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">How do you do the workout? Saddle up, set the countdown timer for ten minutes, come out of the gate hard, and hold on. If you finish with 300 or more you have done the workout. If you finish with 299 calories you have not done it. No scaling, no changes. It cannot be dragged down to a more easily attainable level. Do what is written: just like the original "300" workout, which was composed as a one-time test, and taken without rehearsal or practice.



 Matt Wiebke, founder of the [Gains Lab](https://www.thegainslab.com/) and the Year of the Engine programming, has [argued](https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/ahhv6h/comment/eefxnji/) that the 10-minute test, especially normalized for bodyweight, is one of the best conditioning tests for Crossfit athletes.

So which is it? 300 calories no exceptions,  or normalized for bodyweight?</div>

Don’t forget that sweat and condensation can make you wet even in dry weather. If you can, find places indoors (libraries, day centers, etc) where you can take off outer layers to let them properly dry.</div>

"Why should life have any meaning? Why should there be any purpose to living? Living itself is all that is there. Your search for spiritual meaning has made a problem out of living. You have been fed all this rubbish about the ideal, perfect, peaceful, purposeful way of life, and you devote your energies to thinking about that rather than living fully."

credit companies will jusr cancel accounts of those with high APR. they arent going to risk bad credit borrowers at a 10% interest rate.


most people will get told their accounts have been closed and they need to continue to make payments. you know what low income people do when that happens? 


they stop making payments.

i’ve been kind of obsessed with the idea of autonomous agents that actually collaborate rather than just acting alone. I’m currently building a platform called Kaabil and really needed a better dev flow, so I ended up forking Codex to test out a new architecture.

The big unlock for me here was the group chat behavior you see in the video. I set up distinct personas: a Planner, ...</div>
