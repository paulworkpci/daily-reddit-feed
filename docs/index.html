If you know you have a big thing to do...put yourself on Do Not Disturb.

Set boundaries for whatever instant messaging you use.

Just because it came in, or you read it, doesn't mean you have to answer straight away.

And if they just say Hi relived_greats and they say nothing else, just ignore them.

If they call you out for not responding, tell them that they'd stopped messaging you.  It's better if they give you a Hi and tell you what they want.  If they just say Hi, you'll presume they've been called away and will come back to you, later

Now i have proved it, whilst they may be looking for more than this, i have whittled it down to something pretty simple. Markers, they are heavily weightig their scoring on markers (specific types of characters that AI's tend to produced).

Some of the most common markers I’ve found AI outputs sprinkle in:

                        <div class="comment-body">There is, I'm quite sure, no good way to detect LLM generated content just from looking at the actual literature itself. I've been accused several times of being a bot or using an LLM to generate content simply because I usually write in fairly standard English and sometimes use semi-colons. I've recently re-written my CV to be more informal for exactly this reason - one interviewer told me directly that they weren't impressed I used ChatGPT to write my application, despite the fact that said application was an updated version of a template from *2019*. 


It's not at all surprising to me that you've found these tools simply look for specific characters in specific locations. I don't know how you approached it, but it would be a pretty cool project to take a piece of text and randomly add in ascii characters to see if all it takes is literally the presence of certain characters in any context. Presumably you have to pay by volume of text though, is it prohibitive to have a python script smash through every combination of characters?</div>

Ngl, this would REALLY piss me off, and I would probably be pretty short with an interviewer who said something like that to me.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I strongly suspect this is one of those cases where "the proof will be in the pudding", so to speak, and what I mean by that is -- it's not actually all that interesting to add LLMs to RPGs right now, because dev shops have surely tried it out, and it hasn't been a smash hit.

I think it sounds great in theory, but when you realize RPGs require more than just dialogue to make the storyline (i.e. animations and actual plot points hinge on dialogue), then it would become mostly a gimmick. Because the things that important, plot-tied NPCs would say to you would still have to be pretty tightly locked down, so they don't ruin the storyline, and random NPCs wandering around that you can "talk" to would be no more interesting than talking to ChatGPT in general.

It would be a pain point for the game dev more than anything else. Trying to make sure the NPC you talk to early in the game cannot be prompt-engineered to say something racist or to give away the plot..</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This could easily be rectified though. Like you said RPGs and story based genres thrive on story direction and linear direction. Instead of just dropping a untuned llm into npcs and letting them wild, it would be much better to fine tune these llms to make sense in the story context of the game and where the player is.

For example, if at the start of the story the city is being attacked by something and the player and npcs are in hysterics you could make it so the npcs only talk within the context of what's happening. So if a player decides to be funny and say something like "Did you poop today" or some other random thing people inevitably ask that can break immersion with a llm without fine tuning, the npc would act like a real person in that situation and respond with "What is wrong with you?! Don't you see the city is under attack. I don't have time to talk about this with you! "or a similar reaction.

Then this person runs off and you see them run into their home and start yelling at his family to wake up and leave the house. Conversations between him and the family are all ai generated. So the ai generated portion still behaves like it could be a part of the story instead of being dislocated from the theme of the game.

You can avoid npcs mentioning spoilers or anything you don't want them to by selecting specifically what data they're trained on. So npcs in a certain part of the story or city, only know certain things at that point and context.</div>

I don't think that that's going to be much of an issue as the model technically does not have to be part of the distributed game files. All the game devs have to do is to specify how each of these NPCs is supposed to talk / be characterised as and then require the players to "bring their own model of choice" if they want to use the "instanced AI NPC dialogue" feature. That way the devs can just say that the user is responsible for any "inappropriate dialogue" resulting from their own model choices.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">sometimes. it's hard. meditation can really be bad for people with ocd or schizophrenia. Bipolar too although I've seen a lot of bipolar people benefit from it. But I have seen it do active harm to people. Even psychodynamic theory can't be applied to schizophrenics, it just induces and reinforces their delusions and hallucinations. Not sayind OP has any of this, he maybe has just fallen a little too quickly into more advanced meditation without really dealing with the trauma he experienced (can you imagine seeing what he described? I couldn't just sit after that. I know others can and OP i guess you did, but do you truly feel that this is the end result of that experience, where you are at with it right now?).

Sounds like OP went straight into some heavy insight type practice right after a horrific trauma and has found this explanation to cope.  And his experience is his experience.  It's genuine because it's genuine to him, but it does come accross as a bit like a trauma response (even the doctors and policemen end up having problems from seeing so much violent death).

OP: If you aren't psychotic or manic atm, Instead of making your focus the event, I would suggest maybe some light metta directed toward the person who died and toward yourself. It's very hard to just "lightly note" a recent traumatic event and it will just keep popping up over and over.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I always have to think of the case "dog pooped on the floor, then the vacuum bot came and now we have a brown floor" and wonder what all could go wrong in each such step. Rocks, keys, money bag, or whatever in one of those pockets? Maybe a cat snuck into the clothing box? That all happens to humans, too, but there is at least a chance of stopping and wondering "where's the baby cat?" - Where this machine would probably just take the cloths out and put a dead cat body into the drier just to fold it into shape in the end.

Not that I wouldn't want such a bot taking care of chores, but as you point out: there is much more involved, even when not counting in the plethora of things that could possibly go wrong.</div>

( i have integrated like 28 exercises)

still early but the camera tracking works pretty well. reps get counted automaticall...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You don't need to be an expert to have better form. The main thing here, from a consumer perspective, is that most people would prefer if reps with improper form weren't counted.

Usually you start of with good form and then your form gets slightly worse as the exercise go and you stop when you can't do another rep with good form. If the app didn't count rep because your range wasn't good it would be a good cue to stop the set there, breath and drink some water before getting the next one.

Also the app might evolve to other exercise as well, so the worry about form is very important because bad form might lead to injury in some cases, so it's better to start getting this figured out from the get go.

Really cool app tho, with lots of potential! Wonder if it could be adapted to work with other exercises and angles. For example, using inclined pushups is a good way to get stronger for regular pushups.</div>

Make a scale of complex physical world tasks and then grade them. A very intelligent system should be able to control a robot to compete physical tasks.


I wonder how fast those benchmarks would saturate? Could even include the fabled plumbing.</div>

I have a better test: if robots can do all of my chores: washing dishes, pots, utensils, cooking, prepping food, taking out trash, mopping and vacuuming multiple floors, doing and folding laundry, putting away all the toys my kids spread out during the day. Because passing these tests are so much more helpful to me and families than assembling a difficult Lego set.</div>
