I was thinking about subscribing to the ChatGPT Plus plan, but I started wondering if it might be cheaper to just use OpenAI’s API and pay as I go.

My main use would be for coding, but every now and then I’d use it for random day-to-day stuff too.

I was also thinking of building a ChatGPT-style interface for my wife to use—she’s not very comfortable with the terminal and that sort of thing.

If it’s not too much to ask, could you share what your average monthly cost...</div>

Roo / Cline - BYO api key pay as you go. You can use open router to experiment with different models, as well as use the free ones

Cursor / windsurf - $20 for 500ish prompts, if you go over you can pay more though</div>

They give 1000 credits for the first 3 days after subscription. I don't think that Hailuo 02 is usable yet, and one generation takes like 20min. 

Not meaningful for actual use, but really damn impressive for the AI race!</div>

I know these models don’t have audio and this is only one benchmark. But I really thought that Google had a bit of a moat here with all of YouTube, their compute and team working on this. I expected a good 6 months+ before serious competition would arrive.

"The team used reprogrammed stem cells to grow human organoids of the gut, liver and brain in a dish. Shen says the researchers then injected the organoids into the amniotic fluid of female mice carrying early-stage embryos. “We didn’t even break the embryonic wall” to introduce the cells to the embryos, says Shen. The female mice carried the embryos to term.

                <div class="post-content">Cursor's code generation is powerful, but there is a lot of waste, re-prompting, and inconsistent output.

So we built what was missing: a planning layer.

Now, before a single request is fired, we generate a scoped plan, task breakdowns, sequence diagrams, affected files, everything. Then Cursor executes with almost zero retries.

No extra cost. No change in stack. Just structure.

If you’re burning through Cursor requests fast, this fixes it.

                        <div class="comment-body">This is a regressive tax. When it comes down to it weight is what damages our roads the most. If you’re going to have some sort of fee, it should be based on weight and mileage.

Edit: I think people are conflating two different things. Yes there is a gas tax and there will continue to be a gas tax. This is a new registration tax which is what my point is aimed at. 

A person that does 12,000 miles a year in their Toyota Prius does far less damage to the roads than a person in their Ram 2500 that does 12,000 miles a year. The same thing goes for a hummer EV, which has a weight of 10,000 pounds. It will do more damage to the road than the Ram 2500. On the flipside of that if you are a Toyota Prius that does 40,000 miles a year may pay more than a Ram 2500 that gets used for 12000 miles a year. 

The entire point is to charge more for heavier, vehicles, and charge more for those use the roads more.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Someone else did the math but in order for that $250 to equal what an average ICE driver pays in fuel taxes getting 24mpg they would have to drive something like 40k miles per year.

If they're hiking up taxes for EVs,  let's bring up gasoline taxes as well to make it fair for road maintenance.

Edit: found the math 



"Average person drives 12,000 miles a year.

Average SUV gets…say 22 mpg.

Average car maybe 26 mpg.

Average vehicle the average of those averages is 24 mpg.

12,000/24=500 gallons of gas per year, average.

Gas tax is 18.3 or 18.4.

500x.184=92 dollars per year the feds take on gas tax.

EVs pay 250 dollars per year to replace lost gas tax….

$92≠250.

I’m not sure what’s happening, there!

(PA tax is .58/gallon; $290 per 12,000 mile ICE vehicle in PA; EVs pay $200… but we do pay taxes on electricity…so….)"</div>

                <div class="post-content">I’ve been curious about meditation for a while, and I hear people talk about how it helps them feel calmer, more focused, more grounded. But what does that *actually* feel like?

Is it subtle or obvious? Is it more mental clarity? Less reactivity? A better relationship with your thoughts and emotions? Or just a quiet moment of peace in a noisy world?

I’m not looking for textbook definitions — I want to hear your real, personal experience. How did you know it was “working,” and how long did it t...</div>

We’re going to level deeper, a better answer might be “everything and nothing “. I’m much more aware of what I’m feeling, how my thoughts and moods change, all matter of sensations, and so on. I also see the nothingness of all of it. As one who craves excitement, I also realize that it’s time to increasingly challenge myself to be good with a ‘full belly of nothing’. Medication is everything and nothing.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's subtle until it's not.

The best example I can think of is something that happened last year at my workplace.

Layoffs were announced.  My department was going to be hit with about a 20% reduction in staff, and we were all worried it would be us.

I found myself strangely not that concerned about it.  It wasn't that I had some secret trust fund that would support me if I lost my job, nor was it that I didn't care about my career.

I just felt like I saw things more clearly.  I examined my options, determined what I would do if my job was impacted, and then I just moved on with my life.

Instead of throwing me into a panic like it would have a few years before and like I would have guessed it would have before it happened, it actually helped me see things more clearly and understand better what was actually important to me.

I ended up keeping my job.

That's an example I can think of, and it was after about 2 years of regular meditation.

It's not so much that you consciously feel calmer or better in some way, it's more that things that would previously set you off balance no longer do, and when you do get set off balance by things, you recognize it more quickly and come back to center more easily, and it happens slowly over time.

Meditation isn't a quick fix.  Things often seem WORSE in the beginning, but over time, the transformation is pretty deep, imo.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You change.

Some things that used to feel important start to lose meaning, and simple things you didn’t care about before become more significant. It’s like you start seeing who you actually are, without all the outside interferences.

That part isn’t always comfortable. It can feel like something in you is fading or dying, especially at the beginning. But deep down, you know you're starting to get closer to something more real in you.</div>

Some will point out that in his first term Trump ripped up the Iran deal and spent MONTHS trying to get support for an invasion of Iran, even hiring John Fucking Bolton, but they're forgetting that Dave is a clueless fuckwit.</div>

He's a dumbass for believing Trump was "anti-war" to begin with. How gullible does one need to be to  fall for that? Especially a self-proclaimed libertarian like Dave Smith who has gained prominence from being against Israel and pro-Palestine. What an idiot.

&gt;Sure, he should have seen through it for a number of reasons, but so many of his ilk will make excuses to continue their support so they don't admit they were fooled.

Charlie Kirk said he would be "against a war with Iran" on Bill Maher's podcast a couple months ago, but I have no doubt he'll change his tune if Trump decides the US will be (directly) involved in the conflict.</div>

Now it turns out that, unlike Trump, Walz doesn't demand you have his own political affiliation to work for state government... and the shooter was an evangelical, a pastor, and a Trump voter who was bitter about abortion rights and gay people.

How insane is it that we're gutting everything from the troops' healthcare benefits, to school lunch programs to NIH cancer research, and funding to for AIDS prevention and AIDS exposed babies... and these pro-life "centrists" who claim to be patriots are assassinating leaders because they're scared of gay people? Back in 2004-2008 with Republicans demanding torture, infinite detention in Gitmo without trials, and trillions in war spending, it really felt hard to believe that conservatism could sink any lower, but now we've got this. Rush Limbaugh's legacy really just gets better every day doesn't it?</div>

For at least 60% it's completely obvious that they did everything with chatGPT. And by everything I mean everything. Not a single paragraph has been written by them. And the worst thing is that they don't even understood the texts they have generated. You just need 10min to cross read to ask them some basic questions and you will quickly see how little work went into it.

The degradation of all university degrees is crazy. Most of the absolvents are really worth little to nothing. If I could decide I would almost completely ditch degree's and just care about actual work people have done. As degrees mean less and less almost by the month.

I can clearly see how AI is going to take over all of these classic engineering jobs in just a couple of years (if progress continues). We will have just a few true experts who are 20x more productive because of AI system/agent's which they operate.</div>
