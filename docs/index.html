                        <div class="comment-body">Funny story, the highest ranking elected official in the US to serve jail time was Dennis Hastert for structuring payments to one of the kids that he raped.  He didn't serve time for fucking kids though.  Just for paying them to be quiet.  He was the Speaker of the House from 1999 to 2007.

Can you guess which party had the majority in the United States House of Representatives in those years?  I sure can't.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;  LLMs aren’t capable of learning on-the-job, so  we’ll need some new architecture to enable this kind of continual learning. And once we do  have this architecture, we won’t need a special training phase — the agent will just be able to  learn on-the-fly, like all humans, and in fact, like all animals are able to do. 

Humans do learn on the fly, but they don't learn all domains at once. We specialize, and we can't individually specialize in too many domains. We don't want a million specialized AIs though, or one for each problem, just choosing the right expert would become a problem in itself, like human hiring. And then connecting them up would be another big problem, like organizing team work. At some point you hit a productivity wall, information does not flow ideally between a mesh of specialized agents, each one has its own partial perspective.

&gt; And this new  paradigm will render our current approach with LLMs —and their special training phase that's  super sample inefficient— totally obsolete.

I don't think we are ready to abandon the general pre-training advantage. "Totally obsolete" is a strong word here. He is talking about continual learning, we can still approximate it with in-context learning, using longer contexts, and short bursts of fine-tuning (like LoRa).

&gt; I tried to ask Richard a couple of times  whether pretrained LLMs can serve as a good prior on which we can accumulate the experiential  learning (aka do the RL) which will lead to AGI. 

I agree with Dwarkesh here, in fact if AI doesn't bootstrap from existing human knowledge it would have to rediscover everything from scratch on its own. It took 200K years for humans to go from using sticks and stones to AI, it would be too expensive to replicate in AI. Just imagine the scale of physical access needed for such a discovery path.

&gt; So you can ask the question, will we, or  will the first AGIs, eventually come up with a general learning technique that requires  no initialization of knowledge and that just bootstraps itself from the very start?

Here is a confusion - "a general learning technique" is not what is required, it is a search process. It needs an environment where it can scale up experimentation and feedback collection. The learning technique is secondary to having access to the ground truth generating environment. Just think how much we used - the resources of the whole planet - to get here. No amount of technique can replace the world as our playground for discovery, but other search techniques could eventually solve learning if they have the environment.

So general learning is basically bottlenecked on environment access not on technique. This small distinction makes all the difference when we imagine the future evolution of AI, basically what we do here in r/singularity.


&gt;  Now, of course, are we literally predicting the next token, like an LLM would, in order to do  this cultural learning? No, of course not.

There is a serial action bottleneck though. We can't walk both left and right, we can't drink coffee before brewing it. The body has a mandate to generate a serial stream of actions that is coherent across time. This is no different than autoregressive token prediction in LLMs. While the internal state in the LLM and the brain is high dimensional, the output channel is narrow and serial.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Roughly, we can divide AI into one, search and two, fitting data. ML can be subdivided into supervised, unsupervised, and RL which Sutton advocates. Obviously, RL on its own can't be enough because it's basically trial and error depending on rewards. Supervised requires labels. Unsupervised lacks priors. All of these are hard to do continually since you need to do either of the following:

1. Come up with labels

2. Make sense of the statistics which could be unreliable if the data is compromised 

3. Have a perfect procedure to produce rewards

And fitting/search are sample inefficient because you are dealing with high dimensional spaces. You can use LLMs to produce weak labels for semi supervised learning. Obviously, nature has its own general techniques like evolution, social ensembles, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics, but they are too slow. 

So what we want are strong labels at a reasonable price and in an acceptable time horizon for a multi objective alignment. This almost certainly means an iterative process strengthening labels we can get from LLMs or better with humans in the loop. The technique would combine all the best aspects of search and fitting while also using novel hardware. What you probably want is evolving and discarding models continually to improve the labels continuously.</div>

Also some of the bits I use are docker and docker in docker just doesn't seem to be working right for me.

Then its also super buggy for me, 9 times out of 10 it can create a branch to work in but then cannot create a PR at the end, yet will randomly chip in on other PR's where its not wanted. I've given up on it for the time being, my software is quite complicated but I could see that a simpler setup might work well.</div>

Lately I’m lifting weights 2-3 times a week, MMA 2-3 times, and soccer once a week. I really like the gym and try to do heavy compound exercises instead of isolation, just to build functional strength for sports. I wouldn’t mix CrossFit in my current schedule, but thinking down the line (I’m still in my mid 20’s) it might be something I want to try out, so:

                        <div class="comment-body">Not necessarily directly answering your question, but i have some praise to give CrossFit. I’ve done CrossFit for about 10 years and I swear, every person I’ve asked/seen post on social media say that their only regret is not starting sooner. It’s never too late, and after at least a month, it becomes this addicting thing; you get addicted to showing up, addicted to seeing the improvement in yourself and the way your body can move inside and outside the gym. It’s amazing. Not only that, CrossFit communities tend to be nothing short of amazing, especially if you find the right gym. The community and family you can build if you find the right people is unmatched. Although it LOOKS insane, CrossFit keeps me sane lol, especially because it’s something I can look forward to and when I’m down in the dumps I know people are expecting to see me there and excited to see me there. I don’t know lol. It brings my mood up even on the worst days.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">1. It grows muscle but not as much as if you were straight up bodybuilding and focused on hypertrophy in my experience. But if you want to be athletic then CrossFit easily wins. 
2. Yes. Every lift will go up. I was surprised because we don’t always lift heavy at CrossFit. Many workouts are light, fast, powerful. But it built my strength. And before CrossFit I was lifting traditional for like 18 years.
3. The classes are intense. Some are easier than others but it’s intense af. I’ve been doing BJJ for 8 years.</div>

Same thing happened with the 370Z. Then came the redesign. Boom, nearly $10k more expensive.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I can think if a lot of reasons affordable sports cars have disappeared.

1. Greed 

2. Low build quality sports cars are really tolerated anymore as brand new cars.

3. Emissions equipment and testing isn't particularly cheap and is performance cars are categorically going to perform worse on those

4. When even basic cars can be specced at 250-300 horsepower, most people struggle to justify a sports car, especially in the US where it can be exceeding difficult to find places where handling trumps the extra straight line speed.</div>

* increase prices across the board (brz, 86, wrx) or are sunsetting the product (supra)
* drop the manual (vw)

its not a good time to be selling pricey, subpar enthusiast cars, seems like the Miata, Z4, Z are enjoying some much deserved success

BINGO!

Yeah, I'm so sorry I don't want to spend 60K on a daily driver.  Forgive me I don't like the thought of dropping a grand on two new rear tires after some hooning.  

I did a Hellcat redeye driving experience at a local Mecum car auction a couple years ago.  You do (via the passenger seat of course) a quick 0-40, brake hard, 90 degree turn, some more gas, another turn, drift a corner, then drift around a cone, and then come to a stop.  It's over in 30 seconds.  I was giggling like a little kid.  Best fucking marketing campaign ever!  But no, unless I win the lotto or magically triple my income, I can't afford that car, or that driving.</div>

Since PC-s with i.e. AMD Ryzen AI Max 395+ with 128 GB of high bandwidth RAM can run a &gt;20B parameter model decently (&gt; 30 token/sec), an inner geek inside me is now considering  a setup for local LLM-s, with added GPU unit perhaps. Even if these are far behind from frontier models, I don' t think that these smaller OSS models are as bad as claimed here and elsewhere, and there should be plenty of useful cases for these.</div>

In fact, every week, every one of our students get 30 minutes of one-on-one concentrated time with their guides, and during the workshops in the afternoons, they are connecting and interacting in a group experience."

They're not just on laptops for the entire school day.

I have no idea if this particular school is good or not. The devil is going to be in the details, the execution.

But on paper, if the tuition cost were much more reasonable, I could see it working well.  An AI is capable of being fully interactive, unlike a textbook or multiple-choice quiz.  Assuming software guardrails were in place to focus lessons and curtail hallucinations, it could be an engaging educator.

I personally have learned more in the past few years, spurred by AI models, than I ever thought possible at my age.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Followers of Steven Byrnes' neural network-inspired neuroscience blog will note that he has a central conjecture that the modules of the brain are allocated their share of the attention budget on a moment-to-moment basis from a compact self-reasoning module inside the hypothalamus or adjacent to it.

I've been looking for a while for any papers suggesting a hierarchy-of-models architecture that mimics the human brain's architecture and this looks like a good instance of such.</div>

So, you see, what you're referring to is a transformer architecture :) 

each transformer block is deeper in the hierarchy than the last block.

And the transformer itself, as it trains, purposes different blocks in the stack to different things - especially with, for instance, MoE networks, where you can have hundreds or thousands of "expert" models that each have their own MLP feed-forward nets and collection of attention heads that each have their own QKV layers - each of these layers (Q, K, V, and multi-layer perceptron) is a collection of (embedding-length) embeddings that translate the input embedding to their own reference frame for that blocks purpose and for the next blocks purpose.

Transformers are built from the ground-up to solve and create new modalities in each block - for example, if you input stereo imagery, a modality down the line will likely be 3d or depth information. If you feed it a sequence of images, it will eventually solve time passing as a modality to perform reasoning on. If you train it to act as a sliding window through a long context, it will eventually learn to store information and pass information through embedding slots at each block, where it can even perceive memory as a modality to perform reasoning on.

Mixture of experts isn't just swapping experts at each layer in the transformer. Each "expert" block used contributes to how the embedding is changed, and contributes to the next expert block that will be chosen.

Every single new fancy architecture idea you come up with is _going_ to be something that can be abstracted away to being transformers with extra steps. Even SSSM networks like mamba are effectively sliding-window transformers with less attention steps.

The only thing they haven't solved with transformers is the way the brain stores memory, and even that could be because we haven't gotten around to abusing the modalities created at each block to create memory that the transformer can then recognize and abuse as another modality to reason with.</div>

                <div class="post-content">So when I was in Grad school they taught us walking meditation. That was many years ago, and it went to the back of my mind.

But yesterday I just thought, why not get my feet on the grass, ground myself, and do some walking meditation?

When I place my right foot down, with slow, careful heel to toe steps, I breathe in, then take a step with my left foot (still breathing in), then place my right foot down again and breathe out.

                        <div class="comment-body">In zen practice, one of the main benefits of walking meditation (kinhin) is to provide a break from sitting meditation, so that meditation can be continued for 10 hours or more a day during silent 7 day Sesshin retreats. The combination of sitting meditation with walking is very powerful, and many satori (sudden enlightenment experiences) occur while doing walking meditation between sittings http://www.frogzen.com/uncategorized/walking-mirror-samadhi

When I first started meditating seriously I was inspired by the Buddha’s legendary vow to not move from his spot under the protective cover of a fig tree until he realized enlightenment. I’d get into the full lotus, grit my teeth, and force myself to remain still, despite increasing discomfort. Eventually I’d remember there was something more important to do — like cleaning the oven.

It was a great relief to finally discover that it was okay to alternate periods of sitting with walking, while still remaining on the same general spot.

Sitting too long without getting up is unhealthy. Alternating sitting and walking allows one to meditate longer. The meditation method being practiced, such as following the breath, can be continued during a period of easy walking.

When practicing walking meditation the hands are usually held against the solar plexus, with the elbows out and forearms parallel to the floor, with eyes lowered.

I like to sit for 25 minutes and walk for 5 minutes, which fits nicely into hourly segments, as well as being easy on the body. Walking in a circle clockwise around the meditation area is traditional, as is back and forth on the same pathway.

Some Theravada Buddhist monks sit for one hour and walk for one hour, for half of each day, year round.

Walking at a normal pace is most popular, although some traditions even walk at a brisk pace. The most meditative method is to walk really slow, with an in-breath upon lifting a foot slightly and an out-breath when placing it half a step forward — which also works well when the space is limited.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think this is the key point. Walking meditation by itself is really not that good. 

Better than nothing? Yes.

But you should combine it with regular meditation. For example meditate for half an hour, and then go walk for an hour. If you have the time, meditate when you get back home.</div>
