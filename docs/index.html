If we see more people jumping ship, it may lead to a massive increase of top AI talent salaries across the board, potentially accelerating the cash burn everywhere. 

That panic move may slow things down materially for Frontier labs, not great... Would be better if he could stick to overpaying for startups like Scale - at least that creates liquidity for VCs who can go on to keep supporting the ecosystem.</div>

I’m still a beginner, throughout these last two years really rarely I've meditated for 10 minutes thanks to an app,  I wanted to share the full experience while it’s fresh. If you’re going through the same, or you’re more experienced, I’d really appreciate any feedback or thoughts.

                        <div class="comment-body">Really loved reading this — your honesty about the discomfort, imagination, and internal battles makes it so relatable. That shift from reacting to the outer world to noticing how you respond is a huge realisation. It’s amazing how powerful stillness can feel once we push through the resistance.

I’ve been working with a couple of friends on a small project that’s also rooted in meditation — but with a slightly different approach. Instead of long silent sessions, it offers a shorter, more guided way in, tailored to where your headspace is at that moment. Might be helpful for days when the full hour feels like too much.

Not here to promo, but happy to DM the name if you’re curious 🖤 Either way, appreciate you sharing the journey — it’s a beautiful reminder of what’s possible when we sit with ourselves.</div>

That will have to be solved with Neural Implants, but yeah it’s closer than people think. You probably won’t be able to brute force a simulation of reality anytime soon but you can combine old school 3D gameplay rendering with modern AI filters to augment the graphics to look photorealistic.

As long as the animations and physics are decent enough too. You wouldn’t be able to put a filter over janky animations, so they would just need to improve smoother animations. Which is happening with UE5, they are finding ways to blend animations better.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The way to tell is different. My brother did an experiment, he gave the prompt of “girl playing guitar” to 10 different image generators and every single one of them gave a white young pretty girl playing an acoustic guitar in a rustic setting (when he did this idk but the principal remains see below)

The intentionality of the generation is what he pays attention to as an artist trying to spot ai from real. The way patterns are chosen, and the composition. If it’s generic or like Disney esc it’s typically AI, with tons of detail and lighting. It makes sense given an AI’s job is to give the least common denominator result for what’s being looked for. To generate a result to the prompt that the most percent of people would approve as a valid result from the prompt, or to go viral, get the largest audience possible. Hence, it lacks contrarianism, creativity, nuance to my knowledge. All these generated videos are very generic, while technically almost flawless. To me it reminds me of Disney and the fall of new movies, new AAA games and that sort. They’re all impressive technically, but they all feel the same since they’re catered to the broadest audience possible. Like the thunderbolts getting good ratings but poor reception. In a world over saturated in content, the next goal is to be different unique and interesting. To create the trend for others to follow, instead of following data and recreating what worked in the past</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Why are we talking about safety regulations for AI instead of income security for people?

A Universal Basic Income that responded to efficiency gains by gradually rising would render new technologies a non-event. 

As technology improves, the UBI should get higher, allowing people to work less, but still able to buy the goods produced (mostly) by our machines.

AI is just a tool like any other. It helps firms produce more goods for less labor.

We can imagine some apocalyptic scenarios about “rogue AI,” but the biggest implication of AI is missed potential.

We could all be enjoying more wealth and leisure time, but we’re not, simply because we refuse to implement a UBI.</div>

In the corporate world even the most sane regulation is over regulation. They dont give a fuck if AI kills jobs, they don't want it to be restrained to the point where it might hurt their corporate profits in some way.

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; **Why are we talking about AI safety instead of income security?**

because most people do not know how to think — they simply stop short at a (doomer) opinion

because most people who talk about these things are the privileged top 20% who are blissfully ignorant of the plight of the bottom 80% — they do not know what food insecurity looks like — sweatshops exist in books

because they care about their ingroups, and anyone who is in a different economic class or who was unfortunate enough to succumb to MH issues / drug issues / homelessness is considered subhuman by default — ask any NIMBY, or any municipality that makes it increasingly difficult for the homeless to use public amenities for *basic* needs like sleep

and it js not even that these people aren’t empathetic — it is that they never *actually* think —  
&gt; "why are we imposing such drastically different standards on them?"  
&gt; "why am I blindly following that bandwagon?"

it is not that they are stupid — they are just incapable of being patient enough to do long-form, multifaceted, multidimensional, iterative + critical thinking — because Ctrl+C/V 'ing the popular opinion is easier than *actually* thinking it through and having your own

you said:  
&gt; *we can imagine some apocalyptic scenarios about "rogue AI", but the biggest implication is missed potential.*

the vast majority of people stop at:  
&gt; *we can imagine some apocalyptic scenarios about "rogue AI"*

the second part is fantasyland to them — because they have already bought into the fictional odds of the first part, thanks to sci-fi tropes, doomer instincts, and secondhand panic — without thinking it through *themselves* even once, all the way upstream

but most of all — they fail to look at the miserable plight of the ones outside their ingroup  
the ones who *actually* need UBI  
the ones who are suffering *now*

another parallel is people rejecting drugs whose positives outweigh the negatives for them, because "sIdE eFfEcTs!!!"

because people are biased toward the status quo — and view *any* kind of change through an irrational, doomer-tinted lens — and then pretend it is rational because everyone around them is doing the same

force them to look inside and actually justify their position — and you'll witness cherry-picking, deflection, and hiding behind the branches of speculative, doomer-vibe-coded root axioms that they pretend are facts (and don’t even realize they’re doing it)

because no matter how "rational" you are downstream —  
if your upstream foundation stone is fiction mistaken for truth —  
then your entire tower of "logic" is 100% certified *utter woke nonsense*

because most people never *actually* think it through —  
they just regurgitate what sounds "smart" (and some even go on to publish papers about it, masquerading with "rational" cosplay, even actually leaving a genuine impression on most people who read the title/abstract because it sounds smart and appeals to their intrinsic doomer vibes lol)

and it may come as a surprise to you, derek —  
but unlike you, ***most people do not think.***

because most people are stochastic parrots  
because most people dont know how to go upstream with their CoT, only downstream</div>

Humanity right now is pretty screwed for your average world citizen. What is almost over is the manner of doing things most people are used to. OK. You are not screwed, you are a human being…your people made fire and went to the moon…we can’t handle robots doing busy work? Or even if they became “superhuman”…we don’t know the limits of what humans can do. Throwing up your hands and shrieking IT’S OVER! will get you sympathy and a heartfelt poor baby…but that is it and keeps you blind to opportunity for survival.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I wonder how much RSA encryption breaking would screw up economics. I know it'd wreck Bitcoin, but I'm unsure how bad it would be for the banking sector. There are some encryption algorithms that can theoretically withstand quantum computers trying to crack them, but I've never heard of those being used in any serious field because RSA is so unbelievably safe in a pre-quantum computing world.

IIRC, the only time RSA was ever cracked was when the NSA realized a bunch of encryption companies used a smallish set of primes for key-making and yoinked those numbers and it was eventually leaked that they could break some encryptions using that. Since then, companies expanded the primes they use to be far larger in both amount of primes and the size of the primes too. To my knowledge, RSA has never once been cracked by a computer through brute force.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I feel like that's a superficially important question, but the nature of security is that the weakest portions of your system will be what's attacked. Nobody digs up through your foundation, they break a window. 

And increasingly, the best attack surface is the older traffic sent under weaker encryption. Organizations need to get serious about how likely it is their AES 128 traffic was recorded and will soon be crackable with commercially available quantum computing. If it was just time sensitive, if it would have been an issue if it was discovered at the time but that's passed, cool. But if you've got antagonists and you've sent stuff over the internet you NEVER want them to get a copy of, that's going to be a really unpleasant meeting.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Cool and all but people need to stop panicking about breaking modern encryption. These chips are more rare than nukes, they’re in research labs and they require some serious infrastructure to run and are very finicky. Even if they could get to “that”point, it will be clearly announced as breakthrough research and even then they will still be tightly controlled pieces of infrastructure that some hacker with a dream of world domination cannot buy/steal for another 10 years. By then everything serious will be on quantum resistant codes and the cost will still be as extreme as to make any other attack vector more likely. I’m impressed with the progress, but fusion also had 50 years of “new breakthrough” announcements and there is still no “mr fusion”.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah the government agencies monitor all of this stuff. Even if it led to absolute success, it wouldn’t be mass-produced. At least in the U.S., the government has full right to classify any technology that it deems a threat to economic stability or national security. This means they can restrict all knowledge about the technology. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_Secrecy_Act

While it’s unlikely that anyone would independently create a working encryption-breaking device, it would still be useful to conceal its existence. People and foreign nations would work much harder if they knew if they knew the tech were achievable. </div>

The problem is before that phase. The phase where it is really really useful to say dystopian communist Chinese leaders trying to control humanity and can develop and manufacture inter-connected weapons and financial resources at increasing pace BEFORE it takes its own control, willpower, and ambitions.

i.e., the red lines are:

\- Manufacturing (AI Factories) -- this is basically AI access to physical realm -- you can destroy a robot army, but only if you can outproduce its AI factory.

\- Advanced Inter-connected Weaponry (or communications to it)

\- Can leverage, move, and make decisions on Financial resources (can hire its own humans)

\- Unlimited compute power (controlling data centers for self-modification) or unlimited electric energy access. You have to always have a power cord pull option.

\- And yes finally: if it is building its own successors, you may lose control.</div>

Potential is knowing how things could work and given enough time and resources thrown at it, making it work. What Zuck wants is knowing that it WILL work, so that time is saved. With the time saved, he can make more money back. For someone as calculating as Zuck, you can bet he won't take a losing trade.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Some people are true "night owls" but a lot of people can adapt their circadian rhythm. They just need some time to adapt. The key is to get up at exactly the same time for a while. 

I used to go to bed at 1 AM and considered myself a "night owl". Now I go to bed at 8:30 PM and get up at 4:30 AM. 

That adaptation period is hard of course and is where most people fail. Melatonin can help.</div>

Do you know how graphs work? This is the relevant information one needs to find the slopes of the lines. Well a regression would do some work for us but… just looking at the relative slopes can show us what “20 times” means and particularly what that means year on year.

The claim is specifically that the slope of the china line is 20 times that of the us line which seems feasible to me.</div>

And the more energy becomes cheaper the closer you get to that singularity, it becomes a lot easier to do other wide scale projects like capturing CO2, desalination, hydroponics, other orbital launch systems like magnetic rail guns etc. It feels like the singularity discussion has been derailed by the AI hype and while I agree that true AI will massively help on all sides, singularity discussion wasn't always so single focused.</div>
