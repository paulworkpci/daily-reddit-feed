                                <div class="reply-body">Elon Musk touched my balls in the bathroom of a South Bay bar in 2019. 

I was out celebrating a work anniversary with a group from my floor of the office. I had drank a few too many beers trying to get up the courage to ask out a woman on another team. When I went to the restroom, I misfired and splashed urine on my khakis. 

I was attempting to dry the front of my pants with the air dryer when Elon Musk walked in. He was dressed in all black. He is taller than I thought. He immediately walked over to me, and grabbed my balls. I was surprised. He asked me if I wanted to go to Mars.

His hands are puffy, and very soft. He has a good grip, firmer than I would have guessed. He squeezed each testicle several times, back and forth between left and right. 

He told me that he was building a new rocket to colonize Mars, and that he needed men with, “…big balls for the mission.” He said that his company was building a giant rocket just to go to Mars, with new, enormous engines. He said the Super Heavy booster was necessary, as, “… we need to carry as many heavy balls to Mars as possible, lol.” He said “l-o-l,” out loud, and made a face that looked like he was trying to defecate, but failing.

He said we, “…need more humans,” or else, “… the breeding program will be a failure.” He grabbed his own crotch with his other hand and  told me that his balls were large enough, but that he, “… needs the help other human males.” He said that he knew people at NASA, and could get me on a mission. He said they would make sure the space suits were roomy enough in the crotch.

I thanked him, and then went back to the anniversary event. I did not ask out the woman from the other team, and she is now married with a kid on the way. 

Sometimes I wonder if I should have joined NASA.</div>

I assigned formal presentations in a class and one student did their part of the presentation then *immediately* pulled out their cellphone. Totally a nervous impulse move, and I had warned them to not bring their devices up to the front during their presentations, just to be sure.

Docked the whole group a letter grade. Prof doesn't fuck around. Students complained; Dean made me give them all A's. "Those people pay tuition, sir!" I was told.</div>

My little cousin said that since the whole class did poorly on a test, the test doesn't count.

It's called a curve or something and I'm astounded that everyone could fail something with no consequences.

It seems wild today.</div>

Update: The one with more votes was posted 1m 25s sooner.

TIL: You can hover over the "ago" and it will show the exact time something was posted. The "ago" showed me the post with less votes occurred before the comment with more, but the hover-over shows the opposite.</div>

1.“Fast fashion” denotes rapid, low-cost, trend-driven production that trades durability and ethics for speed and volume.


2. Mapping to SaaS: Applied to software, it means constant, superficial feature churn; aggressive release schedules; minimal investment in long-term stability, security, and maintainability.


3. Consequences:

Escalating Technical Debt: Codebases degrade under relentless micro-releases.

Security Vulnerabilities: Rushed patches and feature flags introduce exploitable flaws.

User Fatigue &amp; Churn: Customers tire of reinvented UIs and useless bells-and-whistles, abandoning subscriptions.

Vendor Lock-In Intensification: Proliferation of similar, incompatible tools forces organizations into complex, brittle stacks.

Developer Burnout: 24/7 sprint culture sacrifices craftsmanship and morale.



4. Counter-balance: Speed of innovation and democratization of tooling will briefly accelerate experimentation.


5. Synthesis: The transient gains in velocity and menu-bloat do not offset the systemic erosion of quality, security, and human capital.
Definitive Judgment: This “fast fashion” turn in SaaS is overall a detriment. It undermines code integrity, user trust, and long-term viability.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">In order to maximize marketing CrossFit to the general public, you need to lock in someone with an already huge established platform.

For example, if Benny Blanco got into CF ( he's not in good shape, not at all, but it's part of his "appeal/gimmick" in the music industry) and really loved it, then you'd have him doing it and talking about on his huge social media platform. And if he's doing it, Selena Gomez is doing it, so you also get a lot of younger girls becoming interested in it. Then Blanco gets Halsey and Ed Sheeran into it. If Sheeran loves it, maybe he goes to the Games and someone smart ( not Castro obviously) could convince him to play a song or two very informally at the opening and closing. 

Run a hypothetical, if James Sprague had older family, and by coincidence they were lifelong friends with the parents and grandparents of the girls from Blackpink, what is that worth in marketing and earned media if you have Sprague all over Kpop social media everywhere? Who is that guy? He's does CrossFit. What's CrossFit? We don't know, but Jennie is into it too. We should do it. 

Are the Kardashian's likeable? Not to many. But who cares, they have a huge platform, and combined, their social media pull is overwhelming. What is Jayson Hopper had a brother who was dating a Kardashian? 

Who the hell is Kroy Biermann to the average person? Well he played in the NFL, but he was no superstar. But he was married to one of the Real Housewives Of Atlanta. And his public profile was pretty robust compared to his on field production. 

You don't need to be likeable. It doesn't hurt to be likeable. But you don't need to be likeable to be marketable. Jayson Hopper could be an ex con who used to smuggle drugs and guns across the world. But if he was cousins with Zendaya and got her into CF, and her huge platform was mobilized to help promote CrossFit, what do you think would happen? 

I'm absolutely exhausted with people banging down on Sprague in this sub. If he was cousins with Timothee Chalamet, and they were in the middle of a Catholic church parking lot doing WODs together, most of the people here that keep saying they hate him would be kissing the dude's butt. The people who say they hate Sprague, if he walked into your box, with Chalamet, Josh Brolin, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh and Dave Bautista to drop in and do a "sandworm" WOD, most of you would be kissing Sprague's backside endlessly and repeating scriptures to him.</div>
