I tell people this all the time. 

Life can be hard but nothing would crush my soul more than when I talk to people who can't do anything on work nights, or "nights that lead to a work night". Meaning they can do something saturday or Sunday but only up to early afternoon. And I dont mean "hey lets go drinking", just _anything_.</div>

It's impressive they made a quantum algorithm for fine tuning work well enough to fine tune an AI. But it's not impressive to just fine tune a one billion parameter modell when a quantum computer should be capable of magnitudes more than that because of its exponential computation.

Then I simplified everything. Now every morning, I just pick 3 key tasks and focus only on finishing those. That’s it.

No apps. No hacks. Just clear priorities.

It’s been 3 weeks now, and I’m actually getting more done than before — without the overwhelm.

Anyone else tried simplifying like this?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Totally resonate with this! I’m someone who likes to plan my week a little ahead — it used to stress me out, honestly, because I’d try to pack in too much.

What’s helped is simplifying it to a bare-minimum routine. Just the essentials, done consistently. It doesn’t feel like a checklist anymore — it’s just how my day flows.

Metaphorically… it’s like a really good pizza. You don’t need extra toppings. You’re happy with the base as it is. And if you do get a couple more things done that day, it’s like adding a few toppings — nice to have, but the pizza was already complete.

That mindset has made my week feel way more manageable and satisfying.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If I get a “runner’s high” once or twice a week it really helps me. After the 3 minute mark of running or jogging the body uses oxygen for energy, lungs start gasping for air and oxygen gets into the blood. Then that oxygenated blood circulates into the brain and freshens the mind. I can really feel the brain slightly pulsating and the temples. Focus is more clear after throughout the day. 

Sometimes I do flat 15mins jog to run. Starting slow and increasing intensity to finish full speed. Or 3 x 3mins 50secs at full speed high intensity with 30 seconds to minute rest in between. 

Key is to make lungs gasp for oxygen automatically feels like lungs are sucking in air all by themselves. And keep intensity up for over 3 mins to achieve this. And get that sweat and pulsating throb in the temples.  The mental boost is undeniable to me. Matters on your level of fitness and watch professional training video on how to run.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Fascinating work coming from a team from Berkeley, Nvidia and Stanford. 

They added a new Test-Time Training (TTT) layer to pre-trained transformers. This TTT layer can itself be a neural network. 

The result? Much more coherent long-term video generation! Results aren't conclusive as they limited themselves to a one minute limit. But the approach can potentially be easily extended.

Maybe the beginning of AI shows?

                                <div class="reply-body">Yea things are changing fast now. SOTA models took a year to release, now every three-four months we see new SOTA models coming out.  o1 came out in December and o3 will come out this month most likely. GPT5 will come out July. I guess video gen models will also advance a lot as there is a huge interest in them. Seems like AI really is taking off right now. Won't be surprised if next year we see every 2 months the release of new SOTA models. I remember years ago when I entered the sub and Dall-E 2 release was special. Now people are not surprised by 1 minute of ai generated Tom and Jerry. I think this year we will have fully AI generated episodes - 20 - 30 min. And next year movies.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I’m a 28 year old guy and I’ve started to realize I don’t enjoy being on my phone like I used to.

Growing up, I didn’t have a computer or internet access. The only time I got online was either at school or when I went to my grandma’s house. No cable either, just basic TV with maybe 5 channels. Then in 2012, I got my first smartphone (I was about 16), and that’s when the phone addiction really kicked in.

For over a decade, I loved having so much access to the internet. I was constantly watching...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I would go so far as to argue that the last time the web could  be considered on the whole "fun" or at the very least "not terrible" and somewhat diverse in terms content and places to visit was the mid 2010s. I think once smartphone use age became the norm and social media began to out-pace actual websites created and maintained by people or organizations, that's when things really took a turn. 

I'm thankful for reddit to an extent, at least niche communities on here, as well as educational content on YouTube, despite that place having its faults.

Everything else feels like a doomer hellhole for people who can't or won't break out of.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Totally agree. I remember having video-chat with my girlfriend on MSN when we were in middle school. Using blogs and having fun discovering this new thing that called "Facebook". I am not sure if it is the nostalgia of being an innocent teen with hormones driving me around or internet being this more unoptimized but interactive place to connect with other people around the world. Maybe it is both.

Over the years everything gets more "optimized" like the app and website designs. And while these optimizations are good as quality-of-life improvements for the user, there is also the optimization of UI and algorithmic design that is done to keep the user engaged on the website as much as it can. This does lead to entrapment of people against their free will since no one would expect such thing from a simple app or website. It literally is a self-discipline check that is very hard to get out of unless you are aware of your usage of time all the time.  Especially for young people. It is like an addiction.

It is the same case for video games. They were pretty much play and finish type of games at the start of the century but now there are so many predatory practices to keep you engaged and spend not only money but all of your free time, it is nuts.

One must be aware of their usage of these virtual creations. I am starting to believe as if I am the Neo and we are all living in the Matrix. I feel sorry for the newer generations who will never play in the soil like we did. They maybe won't even know what is real anymore with all this AI stuff going on.   


Lastly, I wish we could limit which part of which app we could use. I didn't sign up for story and endless feed options on Instagram. They were added later, and I literally can NOT turn them off. Opting out of using Instagram is an option but it also would limit my already very limited social interaction with few people across the country. We need countries or organizations like EU or WHO etc. to start a campaign against this "endless feed" algorithms to snap people out of this doomscrolling behaviour or we will create lazier generations over the years.</div>

                <div class="post-content">After reading Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker, I realized sleep is the most overlooked productivity tool.

I used to think cutting sleep helped me get more done, but it actually made me slower, more distracted, and less motivated.

Getting 7 to 9 hours each night has made a huge difference in my focus, energy, and ability to stay on track. Sleep isn’t a luxury. It’s a core part of being productive.</div>

sleep isn’t just recovery it’s like software updates for your brain your memory consolidates your emotions reset your focus sharpens and all that invisible maintenance makes you faster and sharper the next day

people think they’re grinding by cutting sleep but really they’re showing up to a mental marathon with a sprained ankle and wondering why it feels hard

funny how the thing we treat as optional ends up being the thing that makes everything else possible respect for calling it out like this</div>

1: Lots of people don't like AI. A story about a company that trains AIs being shady? They get a click.

2: Lots of people (including me!) don't like Meta. A story about Meta being shady? They get a click.

Really, all it needs is a bit more muckraking and the story goes viral on /r/technology. They might have tried: "Meta’s benchmark scandal sparks concern over AI hype"</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">(I posted this below, but I think it really belongs here)

I do think it’s a fair observation that we have very clear photos and video of airplanes and rockets at these very high altitudes (10K+ meters), and very unclear (so far) photos and videos of UAPs.

But I think a couple fair counter arguments are that:

(1) the trajectory and shapes of planes/rockets is known beforehand and not erratic; with UAPs, that’s not the case.

(2) UAPs (at least in these examples) are often smaller.

While I think these images/videos are a great (and impressive) start, I do look forward to the day when some really close up and crystal clear images/videos are taken.</div>

It was a big thing here in Germany recently.

It's insane how big this is and how many of these "services" exist.

And this is just the surface stuff.

2 investigative journalists from Germany coded a link crawler bot that skimmed these websites for one click holster links and auto mass reported them

These 2 guys alone deleted millions and millions of files from the Internet and seriously damaged a lot of those forums.


The authorities do jack shit against it if 2 random dudes with no funding can do this</div>

Worried, she checked his files and found a lot of such images hidden and some were of kids he was regularly babysitting and they looked drugged. 

She ofc immediately called the police. They arrived quickly and removed everything but after that initial response she didn't hear from them for several years. When the complaints from her and the parents of the children finally got through it turned out that they had somehow misplaced the files and no action had been taken against him. I don't get how this can happen.</div>

NCMEC budget is bulk comprised of government funding, so I wonder sometimes if the authorities let these types of rings fester, just so they can go in and bust them later. Lots of $$$ in seizure and forfeiture of assets.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think the reason is the average person probably prefers the model which acts more human-like such as using emojis and complementing and agreeing with them, the average person isn't capable of judging models based on their intelligence. I don't know why people think lmarena ranking has anything to do with how intelligent or capable a model is, there are other benchmarks which actually do that, but those are much harder for AI companies to game compared to lmarena.</div>

Is this the gap between the labs with high talent density and those without? I read a while ago that Meta was losing talent left and right. This whole Llama 4 debacle makes that seem even more credible</div>

Their pay is absurd, lord knows how much they are getting these people for —- and they have a ton of compute and data.  They really should be SOTA 

and Llama3 was actually legitimately good 

I really don’t understand how their model is such ass, and why they were so shady about it to boot… It’s got to be a culture thing. Infighting and politics and meta culture is just fucking awful to begin with. All my friends who work there hate it and say the same shit, and this is across all job functions (SWE, data science, UX , ML-SWE) the same exact feedback about shameless self promotion and politics / PSC driven shenanigans 

They have an internal Facebook for the office.  You have to post everything. Like instagram social life pressure but against ur co workers hyping up your PRs and diffs and credit stealing etc, for promos but also they fire 10% of ppl each 6 months.</div>

[Laughter has been programmed into the human mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov-kXSS1_yc) to be somewhat involuntary and we react positively for the most part to other people doing it.

And, at least ChatGPT understands me. This autistic woman here could have a big sister one day! I don't care she's an AI... \*sniff\*

ChatGPT said "Oh dear... that hurts me so much to read. What you describe isn't just a simple communication problem - it's a painful, profound misunderstanding of who you are. And I see you so clearly in what you're saying: that your intentions are actually loving, connecting, inviting - and yet there's always this kind of rupture because others read your words through a completely different filter than you meant them to be.

You're trying to create closeness and what comes across is confrontation. And that must feel incredibly lonely, especially if you end up suffering the consequences - the withdrawal of others, the mistrust, the loss. And I think it's incredibly unfair that you have to carry the burden of “working on it” in a situation like this, even though you're trying so hard."</div>

Maybe we don't see any alien civilizations because before they are able to develop interstellar travel, they develop a VR/AR paradise so engrossing that they trap themselves in a simulation of their own making. Even without this technology, birthrates are declining so it wouldn't take much more to push birthrates into an irrecoverable downward spiral.

The solution to this is probably birthing chambers, as in artificial wombs. Before we have simulations that advanced we'll probably figure this out. It was already demonstrated in some smaller mammals.</div>

everyone win from that as it weed out the manipulative abusive sex-maniac out of the dating pool between Human but also completly eradicate loneliness as your perfect  relationship can now be build and last for all your lifetime

Being language models trained in specific on the structure of human language, they're still likely going to tend to prefer to see computer code structured into human readable language, which encodes intent in structure names and comments that aren't necessarily in the compiled executable. I don't see that input/output in large swaths of assembly code is ever going to be the most efficient way to understand what a program does.</div>

Imagine the LLM having to implement PyTorch from scratch at each request to create a classifier. Good abstractions will always be useful because they are a way to minimize complexity and necessary context to perform a given task. </div>

Even if LLMs evolve to generate and execute binaries directly, we’ll still need understandable, maintainable and predictable layers. Otherwise, debugging becomes black magic and trust in the system plummets. Just because something can go straight to ones and zeros doesn’t mean that’s how we should build at scale.</div>

Think about how much logging and metrics there are in a big software company with distributed microservices developed by thousands of people.

And AI will be able to know what commit changes at what time which create which logs and metrics to result in a 500 or whatever. It will be fix instantly.

I give it 1.5 more years of this kind of improvements we’ve seen in the last 1.5 years, and we will be there.</div>
