The following submission statement was provided by /u/PositiveSong2293:

---

In October 2017, an intriguing post appeared on the Facebook page “Art Bell’s Midnight In The Desert Feat Heather Wade.” The post featured a daytime photograph of a “UFO” in the desert, with a helicopter hovering above the scene. The accompanying text read: “I’ve had these photos for 10 years, and it’s time to share them. They were taken in July 2007, during a radar test at our field in the Mojave Desert. I’ve always hesitated to show them, but here they are now.”


"In an attempt to get to the bottom on these alleged UFO photographs the have been analysed by five different people from around the world. Jason Gleaves from the UK is of the opinion that they are the genuine article. Dr Bruce Maccabee from the USA is not sure whether they are fake or real and the same goes for Tobias Lingren in Sweden. And last but not least Ricardo Varela and Inajar Kurowski in Brazil left us in no doubt that they believe the photographs in question to be fake."

I work with the creative industry every day, and 6-8 years ago I had an experience that i've mentioned here before on my normal account, where I saw a huge chrome sphere several stories tall, hanging perfectly still, right next to a skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur... I was with a whole group of people and I was the only one that thought it was "weird" or interesting. Everyone was just like "LOL UFO" and went on with drinking....

In other notes - except the shape, my experience is exactly the same visuals as these pics. For what it's worth.</div>

I thought he meant he was getting rid of the grifters around him, but it turned out to be quite the opposite. It's how we ended up with magic coffee, and the stupidity he is swamped in. 

Younger listeners just won't get it, you had to go through this transition in real time to fully appreciate the change. I kind of get it when 2021+ listeners say "but he hasn't changed". Yeah, because you weren't around when he was completely against everything he is now.</div>

JRE used to feel cool young and hip. Nowadays I literally hear 50+ Republican type dudes rant about how amazing Joe is. I'm sorry but that's not cool. What the comedy scene looks like nowadays most the JRE podcast boom is kinda lame and not cool. Dick riding Elon Musk, or any President let alone Trump is not cool. I am 30 now and I cannot imagine a 16yr old kid getting into the podcast like I did.</div>

I mean have you used o1 as a software engineer? I don't see the hype, nor anything even close to agentic systems replacing engineers en mass this year.

As the economist titled, 'It's crunch time for AI' this year, they either make their business cases or we are going to see a huge drop in investment in these companies.</div>

Chollet tend to think that thinking should cost way less than the compute we throw at it right now, ARC trained o3 takes 13 minutes per ARC task while an ARC trained human probably takes 10 seconds median time, and a symbolic solver would never take more than a second.

There's a guy who was a meth cook like Trevor, and also a whiz hacker like Lester, whose name was Michael, and was kept out of jail by his deep state handlers, until he wasn't.

There's a guy who was basically just a serial killer, and had charges dismissed multiple times, because he was an "FBI asset" conducting hits for the deep state.

There was even a guy who was an asset/agent called himself a "facilitator" who "achieved objectives set out for him" and was rewarded a part in a movie for it, later had his death faked when he was outed.

Great documentary, everyone should watch.</div>

Give that channel the biggest algorithmic punishment you can: Click the tree dots and then 'Do not recommended channel' 


Do not engage with it in any other way, disliking the video and cussing at them in the comments is still engagement and benefits the uploader.


By telling the algorithm to not recommended the channel anymore you're also helping it unders...</div>

The platforms by design DONT want to feed you content you dont want/like - it lowers engagement, stymies further use of the app, and lessens the overall positive experience they want their users to experience.
Don’t comment on them in protest (positive engagement), dont “angry face emoji” react to them (positive engagement), find the 3 dots or the options for the post, and there will always be a “I dont want to see this” or “show me less like this” etc 

Happy scrolling!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">One way to visualize this change: We have a global economy where progress could happen faster, but it doesn't because there are not enough skills/intelligence/people to do the work. 

This shift will start with a sudden growth of the economy. The number of *contributing* agents will rise rapidly. Like adding more workers with enormous outputs and minimal consumption. 

As this trend continues, we'll see a doubling, then a tripping, and then a 10x of the number and quality of productive agents. With some extremely high output agents (ASI's) mixed in. 

That will then 1,000x. Then 10,000x. And continue. The limit is the universe itself and not just Earth or our solar system.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That sounds amazing! Where did you take this class? I’m actually not sure if I know how to swim. My parents are both great swimmers, and they often took me swimming as a child. But when I swim it looks like I’m flailing and when they swim it looks effortless. Also they can tread water and I can’t. Also in college, we had to swim 2 laps to graduate, and I failed it bc I could only swim 1 lap before I got too tired. So I had to take a swim class in college. But it was mostly how to float so I didn’t learn anything new. You just reminded me that maybe I can still learn how to swim, even in my 30s.</div>

I had chatgpt summarize the article after asking if it is clickbait:


Researchers from Nanjing University and the Max Planck Institute, guided by the AI tool PyTheus, discovered a simpler method to create quantum entanglement between photons. While attempting to reproduce standard entanglement-swapping protocols, PyTheus suggested a new approach based on photon path indistinguishability. Initially dismissed as overly simplistic, the method was later validated and eliminates the need for pre-entangled pairs or complex measurements. AI played a key role in this breakthrough, making the headline accurate rather than clickbait.</div>

I was taking out the trash this evening and noticed a very bright satellite, that looked much lower and brighter than a satellite typically looks.

As I watched it approach from the south, I noticed that it did not travel in a straight line, but was making a slow arc from South to East.

I managed to get a few pictures with my Samsung S23 ultra. Not sure what I'm looking at here but thought I'd share.

Certainly not an aircraft or drone. 

I wish I could have gotten better pictures but I wouldn't have been able to get to my camera in time.

not to say this isn't interesting and impressive, but I don't think it is a valid measure of consciousness.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">From ChatGPT:

  
"Many scientists believe that animals have some level of consciousness. They can show emotion, solve problems, and respond to their surroundings. But we don't know exactly how they experience awareness. Different animals might have different forms of consciousness. Research on this continues."

"Some level". I'm not an expert but I guess technically this should level of consciousness.

Also some animals pass the mirror tests like goats, elephants or dolphins apparently:

&gt;The **mirror test** is used to assess self-recognition, a possible indicator of self-awareness or consciousness. Some animals do pass the test, suggesting they recognize themselves in a mirror. Examples include:

&gt;**Great apes**: Chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and some gorillas.

&gt;**Elephants**: They’ve been observed touching marks on their bodies visible only in a mirror.

&gt;**Dolphins**: Bottlenose dolphins demonstrate self-recognition by inspecting marks on their bodies in mirrors.

&gt;**Magpies**: This bird species has shown the ability to recognize themselves by removing marks seen only in a mirror.

&gt;However, many animals fail the test, but that doesn't necessarily mean they lack self-awareness. The test may not suit all species due to differences in perception, behavior, or cognitive priorities. For instance:

&gt;Dogs might fail because they rely more on smell than sight.

&gt;Other species might not care about or understand the mirror's significance.

&gt;The mirror test is just one way to explore animal consciousness and has its limitations. Many researchers argue for broader approaches to understand the diverse forms of awareness across species.</div>

Being able to know it’s your reflection in the mirror is self-recognition, not necessarily self awareness. Recognition is a cognitive skill.</div>

For instance, we have clear example of these models taking steps to prevent themselves from being shut off and/or to protect themselves from further training. Which means they developed a model of the world. They developed a model of their place in the world. And they wish to maintain their place/their existence to accomplish whatever goals they've been tasked to accomplish.

Some would call survival instinct an example of consciousness. Others would dismiss it altogether. 

And so the goal post will continue to shift... even as the models continue becoming more capable.</div>

For context, I am two things, one is a very sceptical person, so I am the nerd that goes “source?” when I hear something outlandish; the other is I am very practical, I’m the one that keeps calm despite panicking inside during a crisis, the one who needs to know the...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There's a natural bias that makes cynical people or pessimistic people sound smarter. This aspect of psychology is important and even comes up tangentially in topics like investing. Cynical people are actually often stupid, but "next year is gonna be amazing!" doesn't have the same ring as "next year is the end of the world!" Even though neither one is a particularly better prediction.

Anyway, Reddit is the worst. TikTok is probably the happiest social media but lots of people say it's the worst one for some reason. Depends on your feed, I guess.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I used to use TikTok. The vibe on there was so much better than Reddit. Unfortunately the short form content really does ruin your attention span so I think it's overall worse for mental health. Not that Reddit is the holy grail many people make it. I see so many say they don't even consider Reddit social media because they "learn so much".

  
Like, I know i can't talk because I'm still here too. But this site is definitely social media, and definitely not as educational as people here like to believe. You spend 90% of your time scrolling through BS and reading the same snarky comments over and over. Then the other 10% of the time there's some really helpful info about your niche hobbies which seems to make the other 90% worth it. Is it? Probably not. But not sure what else to do.</div>

but I *"Ackchyually"* wanna add that there are times happiest ≠ better since tiktok's algorithm is feeding you dopamine rush nonstop just like other addicting stuffs. For me, there's always beauty in the balance either way.</div>

I’m an artist and a long time ago I remember when AI was introduced to the art space I was telling some people to really start to collaborate more, do projects and learn marketing as a solution to the situation I was met with so much hate for being practical where as people were panicking lol. But knowing now most of the people on Reddit are bots,people going through a phase, or just people yelling in the echo chamber. Like you wrote I think the best thing to do is spend more time in real life with those we have a bond and connection with then on the internet for sure it’s helped out tremendously id say my only problem is Reddit even though I usually just come to this sub mostly and Pinterest.</div>
