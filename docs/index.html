I’m not sure if it should be used to solve VR meetings but I can totally see it in gaming or assistant AI avatars.</div>

Even ignoring the societal issues, having gambling ads so prevalent, having leagues advertise gambling in their presentations, and having almost all coverage of the sports through the lens of gambling, is so annoying to me as a consumer.</div>

A genuine gambling addict has almost no chance of avoiding predatory marketing. You can’t watch sports, TV, YouTube as an Australian (particularly young susceptible men) without being bombarded by advertising one of the many sporting apps.

Genuinely think it should be accessible to those who want it but the marketing should be so restricted to the point it’s non existent.</div>

Elon went in, took no shit, fired all the dumb dumb deep state liberals, and saved the federal government a bunch of money

Now, the government is only 38 trillion dollars in debt. I salute you, Elon!

                        <div class="comment-body">Elon promised to cut $1T in waste from the federal budget, and use that to end income tax. Instead DOGE was run by a bunch of 18 year old clowns who constantly misreported what they were doing. He only cut about 1% of what he promised and those saving were completely negated by Trump's BBB which EXPANDED federal spending by over $1T! 

Then Elon called Trump a pedophile and was never seen in the white house again. Shortly after that it came out in reporting that he was taking ketamine and other drugs the whole time, which is pretty believable when you look at his behavior (strange nazi like salutes, screaming with a chainsaw on stage, etc)

This guy should be embarrassed to show his face but somehow I feel like none of this will be addressed in the podcast.</div>

Current projections show cuts to USAID will cause **14 million preventable excess deaths by 2030.** 

We saved 35 billion by eliminating USAID, and at the same sacrificed all of the soft power and good will that it enabled. Then we agreed to bail out Argentina to the tune of $40 billion. Can one of the bootlickers in here explain this to me?</div>

For example, I can highlight code and say: *“Make this more readable”* or *“Add type hints”*, and it applies the result right there.

It’s surprisingly useful when you want to stay in flow without switching tabs or typing prompts.  
Has anyone else here played with voice-based coding tools? Do you think it could become part of your daily workflow?</div>

You can usually tell which celebrities or executives want to be treated like they're kings (e.g. you know who). Do not try this on them. But my experience has been that most people who are powerful business people or famous celebrities actually just want to be treated like normal people. They actually don't like it when people fawn over them saying how wonderful they are and how they admire them so much blah blah blah.

Especially people who are entertainers or athletes. Not saying they’re bad people, but what do they really contribute to society?

At the same time, we undervalue people doing crucial jobs like nurses and teachers. 

We’ve become a bad soap opera that passes it off as substantial.</div>

Liev asked if his mother could smell the fish (Tilapia) and I obliged without making any indication that I knew who he was.  Afterwards, he apologized. I wrapped up his purchase and I said "No problem Mr Sabertooth" and winked before moving on to another customer and the biggest grin ever spread across his face.

The customers were all over Dwayne Johnson so there was no avoiding it for him.  Poor guy lol

Sissy Spacek came in sometimes too, but she was kinda mean so she got the regular grouchy old lady treatment.

If you're out there Liev Schreiber, I was 100% geeking out and held it in like a champ.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It will be awhile. Hardware has to be faster and software more efficient. When a human does laundry we are planning and acting at the same time. All the robots plan, then act. Any changes interupt the act phase and require a new planning phase. This is on top of them being very slow in both phases. I do recall a demo where a robot was able to keep up as a person moved a object around however. It still lagged behind though.

This is where generative simulation  AI can help. It's constantly running independent of the robots actions and planning. It's predicting what will happen in the next X frames based on the video input. We know this works because you can do it right now with image to video. The problem is that it's still too slow for real time work.

This would allow the robot to estimate what might happen without needing to do a full physics sim. If they want to be really cool they would have the robot act only based on the sim AI. Rather than acting on the current real frame it's acting on the next generated frame. So even before something happens the robot is already reacting to it. I would love to see what that looks like, but it would require a reasonably accurate sim AI.</div>

It's not really easy to create a good music generator which is why up until now Udio was Suno's only competitor. 

OpenAI is reported to be working on a music generator. They have the resources and the talent, but are they brave enough to withstand the lawsuits? It would be a disaster if they all end up "partnering" with big corporations like UMG.</div>

When? as soon as they are profitable and the occasion present herself at the door.

Despite very limited coding skills, it runs somewhat smoothly across devices, showcasing how rapidly new tools for game development/prototyping are evolving. Supported by Nitro Games, this experiment explored creative possibilities through AI. It will likely remain unfinished, as further work would shift toward traditional development rather than AI-driven exploration...

Should they have to go through medical / legal school with humans to gauge how they actually interact with people?

I have far greater confidence that they won't be allowed to attend these schools and will never be officially licensed as doctors. They'll never be given spots to get residency status. It is not in the interests of these schools to replace human doctors, because that's their only product.


Medical AI will either be classed as equipment, regardless of how advanced, or they'll pursue and receive a different license like chiropractors. That prevents them from prescribing medication, but if it's needed, very likely it will get the rubber stamp from a human doctor.</div>

Though I think parallel still has a place in this since sub-queries should be as independent and idempotent.  This would mean you can't really break up a sub-query, though you could benefit from parallel attacks on it.

Definitely a gpu rich approach, I suspect.  I saw a focus on 'latency' but not on 'flops'.  I ran it through gpt-5-mini and it didn't see anything either.

Mark and Jack take a swing at some more affordable cars for a change. I think it would've been nice to see a hyundia/kia in there, they really pack in features on their base models based on the rentals I've had. I was a huge fan of the civic I just had on a 2-week vacation, the liftback design deserves a lot more praise. Maybe it's my old man yelling at cloud moment, but why are OEMs removing USB Type A connectors.

                                <div class="reply-body">**Background:**  
  
I've been trying to decide what vehicle to replace my 2015 Ram 1500 with.  I used it tow [my portable home (toy hauler)](https://i.imgur.com/hlz19g5.jpg) to track days 10-15 weekends a year until a couple years ago.  I sold my 3y/o custom trailer for a hefty profit during covid and now my wife and I go only a few events a year.. so I don't **need** a full size truck all the time now.  But, it's long paid off, so I don't love the idea of another 5-7 years of payments unless I LOVE the vehicle.  
  
I love having my truck - it's more comfortable than the 2005 TL I had before it and I can go to the beach (ON the beach, Pismo) or mountains (snowy Tahoe) on a whim.  However, my new job has me commuting 30 miles each way, and I'm not loving the gas costs, particularly with the 5.7l Hemi + 4x4 on 3.92 gearing.    
  
**The point:**  
  
So, I'm debating (cross shopping) between cars that light-up different happy-areas of my brain:  
  
* Another Ram 1500 - But this time a higher trim than my Outdoorsman, a Rebel/Laramie for the leather, a bump to crew cab since I hate the limitation of my quadcab, a sunroof, and adaptive cruise control for SF Bay commuting.  ~$55-60k  
* Another TL(X) - I loved my TL.  It wasn't great at anything but IMO they've long been the best looking reasonably priced sedan.  I'd go with the Apex Blue since it's pretty much my favorite color (in general, not just cars) $40-50k but lose 80% of my towing ability  
* Toyota Supra - I've wanted one since the new ones came out.  They are my favorite looking sub-$70k car on the road, currently.  But as much as I want one (partially to appease my family, replacing my motorcycle addiction with a sportscar) I couldn't afford to keep my truck AND buy it, therefore losing ALL vehicular utility.  But, damn, do I want one. ~$55-60k  
* GR Corolla - I had no interest until I saw one in person and was shocked by how mean that little boy-racer looked.  I'm in my 40's, so I don't know if I could show my face at work in one, and it's functionally more like the supra than the TLX... but it's relatively cheap by comparison and I hear it's a ton of fun on a 'budget' ~$40k  
* Ioniq 5N - These things are basically toaster-ovens-turned-rockets.  I'm not a huge fan of their looks, but holy hell do they rip.  And they're closest to my truck, utility-wise, of my considerations.  It's the only EV i'm currently considering, but the loss of the tax credit has all but eliminated from consideration.~$60k without tax credit</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt; it feels old. You know, it’s dated, it’s noisy, it definitely feels the most cramped on the inside.

The Corolla continues to be one of the most unimpressive but still one of the most desirable in its class, due to the legendary reliability. 

I agree that the Civic deserves the crown. I know Honda hit a snag in reliability with the 1.5T, but now all of the regular Civic models come with the latest version of the venerable naturally aspirated K20, and the Civic is just a thoroughly competent car while matching or surpassing the Toyota on resale.</div>
