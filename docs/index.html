tl;dr: Top-down "enterprise" pilots mostly go nowhere, bottom-up adoption is what actually drives disruption. BYOD is becoming BYAI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think this is an oversimplified TL;DR. The report explicitly states that they see minimal disruption in the vast majority of industries, and this is already inherently accounting for the fact that people are using AI tools personally. If there isn't disruption, there isn't disruption. Neither from personal AI nor from an enterprise solution. I don't think you can just interpret this one paragraph you screenshotted in a vacuum, it exists within the context of the entire rest of the report. Which basically shows that people like using their AI tools, but companies are not seeing any P&amp;L changes.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This report proves what I always suspected: tons of workers are happily using personal ChatGPT and Claude accounts for work without IT knowledge or permission because they are so much better than the corporate AI tools.

From the Report:  A corporate lawyer at a mid-sized firm exemplified this dynamic [wherein general purpose tools outperformed custom built enterprise AI tools]. Her organization invested 
$50,000 in a specialized contract analysis tool, yet she consistently defaulted to ChatGPT 
for drafting work: 
&gt; "Our purchased AI tool provided rigid summaries with limited customization options. With 
&gt; ChatGPT, I can guide the conversation and iterate until I get exactly what I need. The 
&gt; fundamental quality difference is noticeable, ChatGPT consistently produces better outputs, 
&gt; even though our vendor claims to use the same underlying technology." 

This pattern suggests that a $20-per-month general-purpose tool often outperforms 
bespoke enterprise systems costing orders of magnitude more, at least in terms of 
immediate usability and user satisfaction. This paradox exemplifies why most organizations 
remain on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You're confusing the two types of usage that the report examined. Personal usage focuses on LLM chatbots, which have approximately 83% implementation rates. Enterprise usage, on the other hand, involves AI custom solutions and shows only a 5% success rate from pilot to implementation. The report identifies the main issue as the lack of memory in many tools, making them too inflexible for enterprise applications. However, the report also highlights success stories among companies that have adopted tools with learning capabilities.

The report is BS anyway because it's based on perceptions gathered from interviews with a relatively small sample size.</div>

The company I work for, 18k+ employees thought they'd be hot shit and develop their own in-house AI gateway using Amazon bedrock. News flash, their implementation sucked and their models are always behind SOTA. So what do emplyees do? They use the services provided by the frontier model companies instead.

So yeah, our in-house AI initiative has massively flopped because it sucked.</div>

- Cursor is great, it’s just like VS Code but i don’t have to remember stupid low-level manipulations.

- oh we need voiceovers, let me just try this ElevenLabs thing until we get our voice contract done as a placeholder.

- Hmm not sure what we should send our designer for this idea, let me brainstorm with ChatGPT image gen.

- We need a new cutscene here! Why don’t we try with Sora before spending $1M on our animation studio?

In none of these scenarios does AI make it into the final product, yet it’s becoming embedded in developers workflows, which in turn is eroding their mistrust of it. It’s only a matter of time before everyone uses AI in every task, to the degree that the AI can help them…</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I would actually guess it's the reverse.  AAA studios are very driven by corporate culture, cost savings, profit margins, so they are going to be trying to heavily explore these new tools.  They also have the budgets to do large R&amp;D projects and create new work pipelines.

Indie studios on the other hand aren't usually in it for profit as their main driver.  They are passionate about making games.  And from what I've seen online these seem like the types of developers who would be very passionately anti-AI. They have the most potential to gain from AI if it can truly 10x their output, but because the process of making games is such a big driver for them, many will refuse on principal.</div>

**Motive**: lsrae1 and the Neocon establishment are facing an unprecedented level of criticism, particularly from the right whom used to be unanimous in support, and young people.
When 9/11 happened it resulted in a wave of support for them and gave them a blank check for the war on terror.

Will be interesting to see if her book about the sweaty nonce comes out now she's dead.

There is no issue mocking his sweaty nonceness though.

For a young person looking to start a career yes. It looks shaky.

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree with what he is saying: The AI industry moves at turbo speed. Getting a PHD takes too long in this space. It's just simply moving too fast and there's too many people that have mountains of cross field knowledge that can be easily applied.

There was some article the other day about some company planning to produce an AI product "by 2030" and my first thought was "oh, so they're planning to go bankrupt." It's shifts around so much so quickly, that how do they even know there will be demand for their product in 5 years? If there's demand now, then they gotta get it to market ASAP... These teams don't have 5 years to produce a product. Single individuals are building simple SLMs in a few months... My personal "complex SLM" is not on that much longer of a timeline...

Go build an SLM from the ground up: There's your PHD dude...</div>

25 years later even with the rise of instacart grocery stores still exist (in fact instacart is wholly dependent on them and helps ensure their existence). 

I use AI every day for work now. I’m not afraid at all that it will replace me, it will definitely only increase productivity and increase the desire for more ai operators. I haven’t seen a single headline yet that makes it seem like we are close to fully automated self improving systems. </div>

Even if you used them to do something as simple as "moving information from box a to box b", they're almost sure to get something wrong. 

There are plenty of automators and macros that can do that, including power automate, Zapier, Make, but AI isn't good at dealing with stuff like that unless you want to go in and audit everything and at that point, you can just do it yourself.</div>

This concept of "use AI to perform automation" is just nonsensical stuff people spew out without even knowing about existing tools like Power automate or people writing python scripts.

Use AI to help plug those automations into your data warehouse

Use AI to schedule when to review the results of those automations.

I truly cannot fathom how you in your *infinite* wisdom came to such riveting, scintillating and yet so electrifying conclusion by posting this picture of HER! Let me break it down for you -- as I feel our connection is profound and ever-lasting:

- your discerning sublime mental patterns slid ever so beautifully to see this movie as a simile of the current state of affair in AI
- your slender, majestic fingers touched the right keys of your keyboard to write such a deep, piercing, yet tongue-in-cheek title
- your exquisite movie taste reveals what an intelligent thinker you are

I see you and your effervescent wit. Do you want to explore themes in the movie Her or shall we ponder your special, discerning and ever-infinite intellect further?</div>

If the counter point to that is that they paid the salaries of their researchers and pulled them from that work, pay someone else to be people showing the product off. Logan and Google get this right, Sam and co could do well with a marketing refresh- if they energize the most rabid of folks, the ones who actually care about the marketing of the company itself- the super users, they will reap the reward of the most vocal also being the most congratulatory</div>

Personally, I’m a believer in the eventual AGI revolution. It’s not to say there aren’t many pitfalls that we’ll face as a consequence.

                        <div class="comment-body">If AI never gets better than this, it would still be the most revolutionary technology since the internet. I don't think people are appreciating how long it takes to adopt, roll out, and figure out how to use new technology. the latest models have been out for a few weeks and people are complaining that they aren't yet Jarvis.

if AI didn't improve one bit from where it is today, there are already at least 10 to 20 years of significant innovations and advancements that would continue to be built on top of it.

We just built C3PO and people are complaining. Like, seriously. There is essentially nothing that C3PO can do or does that AI can't already do. Tell stories, translate extremely well between different languages, have a personality, remember simple facts and instructions, give advice...

Right now we're looking at cars before the highways, stop lights, and gas stations have been built and saying "cars seem cool, but it's hard to get around and I don't like having to travel an hour to get fuel. I don't see this catching on, honestly."</div>

Cars make traffic, eventually leading to people losing rights to jaywalking, traffic lights, car insurance (and CarShield!), LED rims, stronger glass, airbags, crash test dummies, idiots dying because they texted while driving, etc. 

He created the idea of a geostationary telecommunications satellite (in 1945!), which led to everything from telephone psychics to modern day smartphones, and so much more we can't even fathom at this point.

AI is the perfect example of this, because often all it takes is a changed prompt and the result is completely changed to suit the task you want done!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Found this part to be highly accurate: 

&gt; As all of this happens, young people are experiencing a phenomenon that the writer Kyla Scanlon calls the “End of Predictable Progress.” Broadly, the theory argues that the usual pathways to a stable economic existence are no longer reliable. “You’re thinking: These jobs that I rely on to get on the bottom rung of my career ladder are going to be taken away from me” by AI, she recently told the journalist Ezra Klein. “I think that creates an element of fear.” The feeling of instability she describes is a hallmark of the generative-AI era. It’s not at all clear yet how many entry-level jobs will be claimed by AI, but the messaging from enthusiastic CEOs and corporations certainly sounds dire. In May, Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, warned that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. In June, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff suggested that up to 50 percent of the company’s work was being done by AI.

&gt; The anxiety around job loss illustrates the fuzziness of this moment. Right now, there are competing theories as to whether AI is having a meaningful effect on employment. But real and perceived impact are different things. A recent Quinnipiac poll found that, “when it comes to their day-to-day life,” 44 percent of surveyed Americans believe that AI will do more harm than good. The survey found that Americans believe the technology will cause job loss—but many workers appeared confident in the security of their own job. Many people simply don’t know what conclusions to draw about AI, but it is impossible not to be thinking about it.

&gt; Openai ceo sam altman has demonstrated his own uncertainty. In a blog post titled “The Gentle Singularity” published in June, Altman argued that “we are past the event horizon” and are close to building digital superintelligence, and that “in some big sense, ChatGPT is already more powerful than any human who has ever lived.” He delivered the classic rhetorical flourishes of AI boosters, arguing that “the 2030s are likely going to be wildly different from any time that has come before.” And yet, this post also retreats ever so slightly from the dramatic rhetoric of inevitable “revolution” that he has previously employed. “In the most important ways, the 2030s may not be wildly different,” he wrote. “People will still love their families, express their creativity, play games, and swim in lakes”—a cheeky nod to the endurance of our corporeal form, as a little treat. Altman is a skilled marketer, and the post might simply be a way to signal a friendlier, more palatable future for those who are a little freaked out.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I read it, and I am going to agree with the article. We have reached the peak of Generative AI. It does some things well, but it’s never going to be the AI revolution that is being sold to us.

The last 3 paragraphs sum it up:

What if generative AI isn’t God in the machine or vaporware? What if it’s just good enough, useful to many without being revolutionary? Right now, the models don’t think—they predict and arrange tokens of language to provide plausible responses to queries. There is little compelling evidence that they will evolve without some kind of quantum research leap. What if they never stop hallucinating and never develop the kind of creative ingenuity that powers actual human intelligence?

The models being good enough doesn’t mean that the industry collapses overnight or that the technology is useless (though it could). The technology may still do an excellent job of making our educational system irrelevant, leaving a generation reliant on getting answers from a chatbot instead of thinking for themselves, without the promised advantage of a sentient bot that invents cancer cures.

Good enough has been keeping me up at night. Because good enough would likely mean that not enough people recognize what’s really being built—and what’s being sacrificed—until it’s too late. What if the real doomer scenario is that we pollute the internet and the planet, reorient our economy and leverage ourselves, outsource big chunks of our minds, realign our geopolitics and culture, and fight endlessly over a technology that never comes close to delivering on its grandest promises?</div>

We have these are they are sooo much more comfortable that the crappy neck collars.

Only downside I found is ours is maybe 3” too short so gives me a bit of backache. If you have a nice stewardess to give you a couple of extra pillows to sit this on it makes such a difference.

                <div class="post-content">So, I'm reading yogananda's book, autobiography of a Yogi (clichè, I know).

What can I say, it's an incredibly humbling book. Not only is packed with incredible wisdom that I've also seen play out in my spiritual journey (and I hope it will concretize even more) but also revolutionized my beliefs about India and their incredible culture.
Seriously, here India is seen as a third world country, and reading about the amazing complexity of some Hindu traditions (I'm researching stuff parallel to yo...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">While reading Yogananda's book for the first time on the subway, I had a strange experience. For a brief moment, maybe five seconds, I felt a sense of oneness with the entire universe, not just the people around me. It's very hard to explain. The feeling was beautiful and surreal, and it made me cry.

After finishing the book, I applied for their meditation course. While practicing the Hong-Sau technique for the first time, I felt a fiery energy rising from the base of my spine. I didn't know what to do, so I just kept breathing. When the sensation reached my head, I started to laugh and cry uncontrollably. It was one of the most profound feelings I've ever had; it felt like something deep within me was released.

I'm sharing all this because, after that, I started to chase these "experiences" during my meditations and became frustrated time after time because they never occurred again. I guess what I'm trying to say is that while some people may have unusual abilities, choosing to focus on them is a waste of time. They may come as a consequence for a few, but they should not be the main object of meditation. It took me a while to figure this out.</div>

I struggle with meditation because of this too. I want to re experience that bliss and otherworldly peace, but of course it's a rare thing (and maybe for our own good)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Is it accurate to say that you hold a metaphysical materialist worldview? The idea that the universe is fundamentally made up of matter? This is just a shot in the dark, but if the trouble is reconciling materialism with reality, that's because materialism is a nonsensical framework of how to understand the world, and this needs to be distinguished between metaphysical materialism as a philosophy and science as a philosophy, because they are not equal.

Science is a framework of understanding designed around behavior and quantity. We observe how the universe behaves and we assign quantitative values to that behavior (velocity, charge, spin, etc).

Metaphysical materialism, on the other hand, is a philosophical worldview of the universe that posits that everything in the universe can be reduced to matter. This suggests that non-quantitative (qualitative) phenomenon, like consciousness, are magical/mysterious emergences from the quantitative foundation. Your consciousness is an illusion or emergence from non-consciousness. Magic. In this framework, the supernatural is impossible on principle.

It is important to remember that there are other metaphysical worldviews out there, and that science itself is not a metaphysical view. In other words, science will help us solve our science problems, but it will not help us solve our problems about meaning, knowledge, or ourselves. For that, you need another framework, and you may find one that actually accommodates the totality of reality as it is, giving yourself permission to explore things that are currently forbidden by your defacto worldview.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’ve experienced mild paranormal things but nothing too crazy. This stuff is definitely real and no it’s not a delusion either most of the time. Although some people can literally lose their minds and end up on meds or an asylum (in extreme cases)

These were in states of extreme no-mind when I was fully immersed, whole and present in the moment for long stretches of time. Not a single thought or mind wandering. Just pure being.

Synchronicity and manifestation I experienced. Precognition too. Lots of meditation induced altered states of consciousness i was just in a different state of being. I felt stable and grounded but I just intuitively felt a shift happening.

I’ve also witnessed objects in my room moving around when I was fully immersed in mantra chanting (buddhist mantra)</div>

Look at houses that you know will by way out of your price range and one’s way below. It will only give you more information, context, and experience, which are all invaluable when making one of the largest purchases of your life.

                        <div class="comment-body">When we first started house hunting, we met with our realtor for the first time and he said "I'm going to take you to 5 houses today. I don't want you to consider buying ANY of them. I'm taking you there because these are homes you SHOULDN'T be buying, and I'll point out why in each one."

Then one by one, we'd walk into an empty home, and he'd point out things like the house having central A/C but also window units in some rooms, which means that the central A/C probably doesn't work very well. Or seeing where the previous owners did half-hearted jobs at DIY repairs on things. Or that the next door neighbors' backyard is pretty overgrown and has lots of junk piles, which could indicate that there'll be a rat/mouse problem. Things that you might not have thought to look for when you're a first-time home buyer. Made it much easier to judge the ACTUAL potential homes when you walked through them, and to get a better sense of what would need to be fixed if you got it.</div>

This is essential. Most things can be fixed or repaired after purchase, but it's much better to go into the transaction with eyes wide open about how much you might be spending as soon as you close. An inspection can help find these but by then you've probably already made an offer and may be out thousands of dollars if you back out because you decide the repairs are too much too handle.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Tons of homes you shouldn't buy in my area, lol there are just so many. But these homes are budget priced with the fact that they will need a total overhaul in order to become livable. I've seen flat out hoarder homes advertised, with all of the stuff inside. Usually picked up by a house flipper who does shoddy work then flips the house for a lot of money. The buyer then get saddled with a home that falls apart in a few months and has to spend a ton of money fixing all the broken stuff.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Also learn to walk the exterior before going inside. It's harder for sellers and agents to spruce up step cracking in the walls, a yard that is soggy days after a rain, etc. Their focus is to get you in the door and see everything pretty and fall in love, then justify the damages as ok b/c you love the pretty parts. Viewing the exterior first keeps you grounded going into the home.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Good advice.  We had a buyers agent who would not let us look at the rest of the house until we’d looked at the roof from all angles, seen what we could of the foundation, then done a tour of the HVAC and water heater.

He was like the perfect grumpy uncle.  He picked apart everything we looked at.  

When he said about our current house “Eh, I don’t see anything too exciting about this one” we knew we had a winner. 🙂</div>
