You must understand, rich people wanna consolidate more wealth for themselves, but at some magical point, they will suddenly go the opposite direction and try to redistribute the wealth to everyone!

Yes, they wanna make their AI as good as possible so the AI can make everyone rich!

It is like the Christmas scrooge story, the rich people are only greedy for all of human history, but suddenly they will realize they were wrong when they see the 3 Christmas ghosts, and then start sharing their wealth with everyone</div>

Their main schtick is supporting many languages, but the model really sucks at all those languages. 

It's open source though so I'm sure someone is going to get some value out of it.</div>

That its a few months behind the leaders (for now), isn't what is significant about it.

It points to the possibility of two very different AI futures for the US &amp; EU. One where open-source AI is the bedrock of governance and administration, the other where closed source for-profit AI is.</div>

US models don't seem interested in complying with EU law like the AI Act or GDPR.

If so, 5 or 10 years down the line this could lead to very fundamental differences in how the two territories are governed. There may all sorts of unexpected effects arising from this.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Gonna read the paper later (so I have no idea if this is the correct interpretation) but quick skim of their blog post leaves me thinking the following:

&gt; A better way to grade evaluations

&gt; There is a straightforward fix. Penalize confident errors more than you penalize uncertainty, and give partial credit for appropriate expressions of uncertainty. This idea is not new. Some standardized tests have long used versions of negative marking for wrong answers or partial credit for leaving questions blank to discourage blind guessing. Several research groups have also explored evaluations that account for uncertainty and calibration.

Sounds like the incredibly most obvious solution that everyone has probably thought about to reduce hallucinations

&gt; Our point is different. It is not enough to add a few new uncertainty-aware tests on the side. The widely used, accuracy-based evals need to be updated so that their scoring discourages guessing. If the main scoreboards keep rewarding lucky guesses, models will keep learning to guess. Fixing scoreboards can broaden adoption of hallucination-reduction techniques, both newly developed and those from prior research.

But I'm reading this correctly, it sounds like they're saying that it's not enough for *some* evals to be made to target hallucinations, but rather *all* evals need to. The existence of some (many) evals that incentivize guessing will have a measurable impact on making models hallucinate.


&amp;nbsp;


Edit: Reading

So essentially state the obvious "no shit, if you penalize uncertain answers, the models will hallucinate more", and basically state how partially it's the fault of AI labs benchmaxing, because almost all existing benchmarks mark incorrect answers the same as "I don't know". Since the VAST MAJORITY of benchmarks are misaligned for hallucination reduction, it doesn't matter if they then make a couple of benchmarks that reduce hallucinations. 

They also state that "avoiding errors" is much harder than "identifying errors" (again this is obvious, but reading between the lines, there were rumours of OpenAI making a universal verifier, which makes sense when they say it's easier to verify)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm really surprised to read this from OpenAI, as this misses the hardest aspect of hallucinations: uncertainty is not a property of the training data, it's a property of the model itself. Aside from some clear cut cases like "does God exist?",  a model's confidence in an answer shouldn't be predicted from the question; it should depend on the model’s own knowledge.

If you simply encourage the model to say "I don’t know" or "maybe…" and penalize overconfidence, then it'll start defaulting to "I don’t know" more often, even in cases where it actually *does* know. Conversely, it could still be confidently wrong when the question looks simple. OpenAI's tricks might improve user experience overall in some situations, but it doesn't address the core issue.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not really though. You can't train a model from scratch with just saying "I don't know" on everything as it actually doesn't know and will just get stuck there.

It's a very hard problem because the model doesn't know what it does and doesn't know while having to evaluate itself on it. 

The only thing I see working is a 2 phase approach where you first train for broadening knowledge and then post train for reducing guessing, but that also has problems.</div>

Once they talk about something you have in common then you talk about your self. 

What did you do this weekend? Played golf. 

Planning any vacations this winter? Going to Utah to ski. 

Ohh wow I love skiing I’m from Vermont.

The goal is to find a common interest to build a relationship and bond. If you let them talk about themselves they will love it.</div>

It makes the conversation feel more personalized. And it shows that you’re actually listening and not just relying on an internal “small talk script”. 

“Did you do anything fun this weekend?”

“Played golf.”

“Really? Where’s the best course nearby?”
Or
“Oh yeah? How long have you played?”</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I have a friend who is a master at this. No matter what they say, express interest in what it is. It can be the most boring thing ever, but act like you're interested and steer the conversation so they can tell something about themselves. 

Here's an example of how he talks to people. He'll say, It's hot today. The other person says, yep. Then he says, Is this the hottest weather you've ever been in? 

I don't care who you're talking to, the answer to this question is no, and you're going to hear about the time they were in hotter weather. Now even though you were fishing for this, act like whatever they say is the most interesting shit you've ever heard. "Really? What were you doing in Chattanooga? Don't most people travel to Nashville?" "Oh you were there on business? So you travel a lot for your work or?" "I bet that's not the best story you have traveling around for work!"

You want to give off the vibe of "I don't generally like talking to people but I definitely want to hear about THAT."

The other thing he does when talking to someone new is he makes slightly exaggerated facial expressions. Like if you say something intended to be funny, he'll smile and drop his mouth open as if to say "you scalawag!" He'll also use this trick I call "benign contradiction." If someone says something that's even mildly surprising, this can be as simple as saying, "No! That did not happen!" but you lean in to hear more so the person can tell that you know it did happen! 

Basically he just behaves in a way where you are the most interesting storyteller in the world, and he reacts the way you would want someone to react to what you say plus about 10%. Another trick he frequently uses is when you ask him something about himself, he'll throw something out there but then pivot to someone else he was just talking to, and then he drags that person over and says, this guy just told me so-and-so, and you were saying such-and-such before!

It's a real skill working a room like he does, but a lot of the time it only takes him a few minutes to get people talking to each other and then he just sits back.</div>

                <div class="post-content">This 2014 Porsche Cayenne with the base 3.6 liter V6 just sold on CarsandBids for $125k.

Besides being very clean, coming in a beautiful/unique color, and having a 6-speed manual, there's not enough to justify this sales price in my opinion, especially with almost 65k miles.

What are your thoughts?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Completely agree with this, 5-Pro is the best model I’ve ever used. I’m a lawyer and it has produced some amazing work for me. Unfortunately I’m quite restricted in what I can use it for (as I can’t give it any confidential information), otherwise it would be worth far more than $200 a month. Its legal reasoning and drafting really are both excellent. First time I’ve really started to believe that AI doing complex legal work isn’t far off.</div>

I’ll often give thinking my raw data, what I’m looking for, my concerns and have it format and optimize for pro.

“Save America,” a Trump-authored coffee table book being released Sept. 3, includes an undated photograph of Trump meeting with Zuckerberg in the White House.

"He would bring his very nice wife to dinners, be as nice as anyone could be, while always plotting to install shameful Lock Boxes in a true PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT,” Trump added, referring to a $420 million contribution Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, made during the 2020 election to fund election infrastructure.

 “We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison — as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.”</div>

When his economics advisors pointed out that unemployment is like to go up, they fired them. This is just stuff in the last month. He was president for four years from 2017-2021... did people really think all the claims against him were a witch hunt or what?

                        <div class="comment-body">Importantly, this is about pirating books and training on them, not just about training on copyrighted material itself. Huge difference.

If you had to pay to train a model on copyrighted material, it would mean you couldn't even scan and train on public facing, free websites if the works on those websites were copyrighted. 

On the other hand, pirating books is already illegal, whether you use them to train an AI model or not</div>

It was ironic, but when I thought about it for a while it stuck with me. The core idea made sense: The phone is not the problem, we are. I hadn't meditated before but it interested me since I really suffered from not being able to focus as I was severely phone addict with over 9 hours of screen time daily.

                        <div class="comment-body">Numbing/distraction never helped for my needle phobia because pain isn't the issue and it doesn't prevent the other symptoms that come from the panic leading up to exposure: crying, shaking, clammy, hot and cold, sweating, tunnel vision, heart pounding, hyperventilating, ears ringing, passing out...


What does help is 3mg of Ativan. Reduces the panic by half so it's tolerable and I barely remember what's happening which helps for future visits.


But doctors should be more proactive with helping needle anxiety/phobia since it affects 10% of the population and is a huge barrier to medical care! They should be working with patients to offer more sympathy, pain relief, anti-anxiety meds (pills or nitrous), or even just a dark quiet place to recover! I had a difficult time finding a place to get a COVID vaccine that could let me lie down during/after to avoid passing out which was very frustrating.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I feel the same. I’m not anxious about the pain of the needle. I am very anxious about the reality of the needle itself piercing my skin and being inside of my body. 

It is particularly bad if I need an injection in an abnormal place like my shoulder or something. This gives me intense anxiety even if I have no real pain to speak of. It doesn’t end when the needle is removed either. Sometimes it actually worsens. It takes me awhile to “shake it off” after and calm down.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Ativan?! Yikes! Getting a prescription for benzodiazepine is pretty hard in my parts. That would also pretty much make you into a walking zombie for the rest of the day? Certainly couldnt drive home after.. A milder option for some (that dont have low blood pressure) could be Propranolol. Its a beta-blocker that is known to reduce anxiety. Anything from public speakers to brain surgeons requiring extremely steady hands can use it to gain more control over your mind and body for a few hours.</div>
