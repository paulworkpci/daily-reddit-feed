* If something’s broken, dirty, or missing, you’ll have proof it was like that before you touched anything.
* If you misplace an item or forget something when checking out, the video can help you spot where you left it.
* It also doubles as a little memory log of where you stayed like a digital travel diary.

It takes less than a minute and can save you money, ar...</div>

A few days later I could not find my (fairly expensive) beard trimmer or any of my other grooming stuff. I looked all over for the bright green bag I had them in, to no avail.

Then I remembered I shot a video before checking out of the motel, just to document that I was leaving it in good shape. The video documented my stuff packed and ready to go out the door, my black backpack, my black camera bag, and my BLUE toiletries bag. Once I started looking for the right color bag with my beard trimmer I found it in under a minute.</div>

From my tests, SeedDream relies on a text description of the reference image by an llm, nano banana imports the image natively.

Nano Banana can pull that off easily. From multiple perspectives. There's no way someone actually paying attention to the real strengths of this model would call other models incapable of it better. 

There may be certain ways that it's better, but I don't see any ways that are novel like with Nano Banana.</div>

It's significantly cheaper than Claude Code subscriptions, I'm curious if it's worth giving it a try. I mostly use Sonnet 4 via GH Copilot VSC Insiders and while I'm mostly happy with the code output I find this setup quite slow. I also tried Sonnet 4 in Claude Code and haven't notices any code quality improvements, but the agent was faster and I like how CC cli can be customized.

I'm also interested how well these "...</div>

Also as a backup (or for testing diff models other than glm) i have [nanoGPT](https://nano-gpt.com/invite/9yrQteBR) \- also subscription based (8$ / mo for 60k requests per month - pretty awesome deal + you have top opensource models available aswell for different purposes, not coding only).

I usually feel the leather rubbing as the workout progresses and add chalk to hopefully avoid chaffing/ripping. But even if I start chalking between the grip and my palm before the workout, I still usually tear if the volume is high enough. My buddy told me that the chalk is likely causing the chaffing/tearing. Any advice?

Edit: Also, trim your callouses AND moisturize. Steel is stronger than iron because it bends whereas iron just breaks. If your hands are like iron, they tear, is they are like steel, they shift. Be like steel. By moisturizing your hands.</div>

I do keep my callouses trimed (and sanded down). I don't have any issues there - just with the center of my palms. What I don't do is moisturize. I'll start adding hand cream to my daily routine and hopefully that'll help.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If you're [using the grips correctly](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vwQbsGCN6vQ) you don't really have contact between the strap of the grip and the palm of your hand. So no, no chalk between the grip and your palm. 

You are not ripping because you're using chalk wrong. You're probably ripping because you're not using your grips correctly, because you're lacking grip strength or because you're not taking care of your hands, or a combination of these 3. 

Watch the video above and try that method, chalk your grips on the base of the strap, shave your calluses down frequently and moisturize your hands and most importantly when the warm-up calls for 20 seconds dead hang don't be the person who has to run to their gym bag to get their grips. From now on, whatever you can do without grips you do without grips.</div>

The two most important parts of any Guacamole recipe are RIPE Avocados and ACID

My personal favorite is:


3 avocados, ripe

¼ cup diced white onion (red looks better but white tastes better)

1 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro

Zest and juice of 2 limes

3 garlic cloves

½ teaspoon sea salt, plus more to taste</div>

The fact that is was so gruesome and someone that supported gun rights makes the imagery stronger. We hear about a lot of death but never quite see it like this.

Even if people didn’t like him seeing a man with a family go limp and shoot blood like that was an image that will stick with me.</div>

It would have to be remote. ChatGPT cannot connect to your localhost servers. It's fairly straightforward to create a tunnel using a service like ngrok

&gt; Any list of MCPs that actually work with it?

In theory any MCP that works with other LLMs will work with ChatGPT</div>

---

**MCP Server URL**: https://dice-rolling-mcp.vercel.app/mcp  
No authentication

Then enable Deep Research and ask it to use the `dice_roll` MCP tool to roll 2d12+3 or something.

It also works as a Claude Remote MCP Connector.  

EDIT: Apparently only **Team, Enterprise, or Edu** users can use full MCP access in Chat (not just Deep Research)</div>

Their contract with Microsoft also says that AGI is "when we create a product with a valuation of 100 billions", so they're zeroing in on that idea.

It's a good thing to move towards something more concrete. But it's also a mixed/bad (with the pursue of AGI proper) thing to stray away from the measurement of abilities per se: something not intelligent nor broad/general at all can create a lot of wealth. 

I hope they don't lose themselves into some vaporous semantical arguing and truly pursue concrete development *along* scientific development.</div>

There will always be a small quiet minority who are vocal, but for the most part people won't care. If AI can make quality TV shows and entertainment, the vast majority of the population will use it and not care.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">yeah it could upend inequities that have existed for centuries, a world where a public defender can have ai find all the same relevant codes and case law as OJ's legal team with dozens of paralegals is a very different world. 

Just a world where the average person can get accurate and effective legal advice when sent a legal notice is a radically different world, big companies no longer able to push customers and sub-contractors around simply by threatening nonsense would make things a lot fairer. 

Knowing your legal rights and being able to access services you have a right to or highlight a valid case for compensation is another game changer for us poors, There's going to be a time when a lot of these companies that essentially just scam people by making it seem like you have no choice will find that a lot of their customers will suddenly be getting accurate advice and this will destroy their illegitimate business model - banks, real estate, travel agents, there are so many examples where a sizable portion of their income comes from people not knowing there's better options or not having the time / energy to battle their way through the hoops to get those better options. When you can get it sorted simply by asking your AI for your options, picking one and instructing it to take the necessary steps then a lot of people are going to save a lot of money they're currently being semi-scammed out of.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The great thing about the Kasparov Deep Blue saga was that we we got to watch computers passing us in real time like a sprinter passes another in a relay race after a handoff. The first matches were won by Kasparov, then the later ones were DB tying and winning. It was also endemic of our future relationship with AI to hear Kasparov say his play was better but it wasn't fair that the DB team got to study his games and not vv. because this will be the case going forward. We can only have 1 on 1 with Ai, while AI is having a 1 on All with the human race.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Even then, we still watch humans playing chess against humans. 

Chessmasters all train against AI though, so it does show that this revolution "enhanced" the quality of the average chess match, and I would expect the same to happen with lawyers. 

I still believe even if AI writes a good legal analysis, I would still want a lawyer to read it and confirm it's validity. 

And when it comes to going to court to plead, or representing a client in negotiations against a counterparty, I don't think Harvey or Chatgpt is going to do any of this stuff any time soon. Humans will still be required for the interface part of the job.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is what's called "capitalist realism" (check the book by Mark Fisher). In present-day "western" culture, it's easier to imagine the end of the world than a different system. That's how ingrained ideology has become. Capitalism is a historic system. Just like all other forms of societal organization before, it had a beginning, and it will have an end (or a transition to something else). Now, when exactly? Towards what new system? We don't know.

But, yeah, capitalism without workers and consumers would not keep working as capitalism. It would have to transform into something else.</div>

His 100,000 strong fleet of robots can simply farm for him, build him houses, be his bodyguards.

He doesn't need to 'make money' and won't lose sleep about tesla stock price crashing.... In that hypothetical future world.</div>

It's a percentage chance that a model released at the time would be able to write whole or most of a given text.  

That means that this percentage increases the more structured an a specific a text is. The text of a law for instance will always score nearly 100% because it's intensely structured and follow specific textual rules.  

It obviously doesn't mean it IS written by AI.</div>

If you were to compare speeches today to those 50years ago and in between, there would be a lot of similarities - just because 'tradition'.

But I cannot stress how certain phrases being used by one particular personality get absorbed and used to death by their supporters 

- eg: for the birds, did a round a year ago where it was used consistently by all right/center right talking heads.

I think this is one of those cases where the speech writers like certain types of openings and not necessarily AI.</div>

Why? Just cause.

After my dad died, and will read, etc. My uncle told us we should do a FOI request on dad.

We got a 150+ page detailed report on everything he ever did in life. From high school to his terminal illness. Some stuff redacted. LIKE why are they interested in him? Our lawyer thought dad probably did some business with someone shady at some point, but we never found out and they wouldn't say.</div>

The release of the JFK files showed a lot of cases like that, some absolutely crazy.

So maybe (*maybe*) he never said anything because... there truly was nothing to say. Not saying this with certainty, just throwing a hypothesis.</div>
