                <div class="post-content">Their OpenAI deal didn't go through and Google poached their CEO. They also started to approach lots of devs on LI and try to convince them to use Windsurf by offering free licences. Sounds like the act of desperation. Also, I haven't heard of or seen anyone use Windsurf lately.

Is it game over for them?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Probably.   Based on what's going on, so are Cursor, Replit, V0, and so on.  Pricing has whacked them hard, their model vendors are competing with them, and that they are largely vscode forks and microsoft changed their licensing.  

It would appear to be game over for the whole group.</div>

and then there's the movement of CLI based tools like Claude code and Gemini CLI which seems to work amazingly and dont require using vscode.

so yeah it doesn't surprise me that cursor and windsurf are dying fast</div>

Friends with epstein and real estate everywhere. Friends in the media space with his tv show. How tf do people think he isnt the fucking swamp. The *only* thing you can say is he wasnt a career politician (he is now), but like, him appointing all of his elitist friends to his cabinet proves he is the swamp. He just wasnt the same swamp that was in charge before.</div>

He's both the person most likely to be implicated by the info, and also the only person who can force the info to be released, but Joe can't put two and two together.

Kash Patel looking him dead in the eyes saying "DONT YOU THINK I WOULD RELEASE THAT INFO IF I HAD IT?!?" but Joe has been cucked and isn't willing to point out that Kash has to do what daddy tells him</div>

That is until I drove a Toyota 4Runner. Something about that car, it felt like a big lazy truck, I was totally happy doing 55 mph on the highway with my arm leaning against the door with the window down.

Any other cars that just make you chill out and want to cruise? </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Miata. Miata is always the answer. In all seriousness though, when I had an NA Miata I could just drive and never had to worry about how fast I was going. Later I drove a s550 Mustang GT performance pack car for a year and I got pulled over doing 75 in a 35. Needless to say, should have kept the Miata and will get another one in the near future.</div>

Took my miata on my twisty back road gym route over the weekend and I felt like I was speeding like big ticket speeding, and I was just going 10 over. You really feel every mph in a miata.

It can also be an intentional (i.e. not forgetting by accident) style on tumblr. Maybe that’s what this particular one was trained off? Or maybe it did freeze… hard to say

Edit: I feel like this has too many upvotes for how much of “just a guess” it was for me lol. Like, I don’t feel legit, and I don’t think you should take me super seriously. I don’t even use tumblr that much. I’ve probably spent more time on r/curatedtumblr than on tumblr.com lol</div>

                <div class="post-content">So i got a little inspired by an old prompt I came across, it was called the six hat thinking system, i think ChainBrainAI was the one who originally created it. Anyways this prompt gets the model to create 6 personas which was great, but had a limitation with the fact that you're actually only ever talking to one instance of a model. 

So, I built a tool that lets you create a virtual room full of specialised AI agents who can collaborate on your problem.

Here's how it works:

Not many people are imagining autonomous companies with literally zero humans (although I do think that will happen eventually), they are imagining downsizing a company by 20 percent from AI efficiencies — i.e. losing your job to someone using AI.

Because it’s a different turn of phrase people make the mistake of believing this isn’t what we are talking about here</div>

Not quite. In theory, you could prevent losing your job to someone using AI, if *you* are that person using AI. You can't be the AI yourself.</div>

Just look at the marketing and narrative around agentic coding bots, automated customer service and so on. The fantasy at least is that you'll have a CEO just tell the AI agent to code up the new product and it does so without any further guidance.

This isn't possible now and we don't know if and when this will be possible. But it's the picture a lot of people have in their heads.</div>

I’ve always wanted to get into meditation, but every time I tried, I either got bored, sleepy, or just ended up thinking about what to cook for dinner 😅. Over the past few months, I’ve finally found a few simple tricks that made meditation click for me. Sharing here in case it helps someone else just starting out:


1. Don’t aim for “empty mind”
This was a game changer. I used to think i was failing if I had thoughts during meditation. But thoughts are normal! Just notice them, don’t ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Seems like a pretty solid technique.

Mine is to just pay attention to feelings, including where they come from and what they inspire to happen.

You probably know you have no real reason to cringe or feel great every time you feel that way, so why not watch that when it happens to see if you can learn something?

So I watch that stuff just to learn how it actually works in me,

Just like if I saw a shape on the ground I believed was a snake, but on closer examination was a discarded rope or stick, there is something to learn from any such insight into any aspect of myself and how I see the world.

That shape in the allegory was not in fact a snake, so things in me that are just as irrational have less power when I see them for what they are.</div>

If you’re a gig worker, log every work-related purchase in a simple note labeled “Write-Offs.”

Include: car washes, phone mounts, meals during long shifts, mileage, batteries, etc.

Look into IRS 2024 Standard Mileage Rate, IRS Publication 463 - Meals, IRS Publication 535 - Business Expenses, IRS Publication 463 - Car Expenses, etc.

Come tax season, it could save you hundreds.

                                <div class="reply-body">If you don’t do write-offs, you could end up paying taxes on money you never actually kept and that means you lose money. 

Imagine you make $1,000 doing freelance work or running a side hustle, but you spent $300 on things like supplies, gas, or tools to make that money. 

If you don’t write those expenses off, the IRS will think you made the full $1,000 profit and will tax you on it. But if you write off the $300 you spent, you only get taxed on the remaining $700…the part you actually kept. 

So skipping write-offs means you pay more in taxes than you should, and that’s like handing over free money to the government.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You had $1000 in revenue. You spent $800 on things like supplies in order to make that money, so you only had $200 in profit. 

The IRS will think you had $1000 in profit unless you tell them that you spent $800 to make the money (on things that are ordinary and necessary for the business, with lots of weird exceptions). You need to know at the end of the year what to tell them so you only get taxed on the $200 profit not the $1000 revenue. 

The IRS is underfunded and has a hard time
going after people making huge amounts of money, so there's a good chance they'll go after you. It's called an audit and they'll randomly select you to produce evidence that your expenses were valid and you weren't lying about them to save money. 

You need to keep track of your expenses so you can tell them your actual profit amount and keep evidence of those so you don't face fines and penalties after an audit</div>

Others right mention annoying their current customers, but there I think that’s a bit easier. The creatives who use Macs already use ChatGPT, and those using Apple products otherwise aren’t usually on the forefront of tech. As long as ChatGPT sounded like default Siri, not a huge change there.

But in general I don’t see how this works for Apple. They def need a better AI integration. But their hardware innovation problems and the sales they need to keep being in the trillions, that’s not coming from ChatGPT.</div>

Nevertheless OpenAI is still chugging along, sitting at #1.

Suffice to say at least BusinessInsider's content is secured moving forward. Should be the end of OpenAI again in about 2 months or so.</div>

If someone were to ask me what models they should use for a personal or professional project, there isn’t a single case I can think of that I’d recommend an OpenAI model over at least one other model from Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Llama, Mistral, etc

The tough thing about LLM competition is that unless you have a massive cost advantage, the best model for a use case will take the majority of the customer base over the long run</div>

1. I definitely think Claude's coding skills are overwhelming. Grok doesn't even compare. There's clearly a big gap between benchmarks and actual user reviews. However, since Elon mentioned that a coding-specific model exists, I think it's worth waiting to see.



2. It seems to be genuinely good at math. It's better than O3, too. I haven't been able to try Pro because I don't have the money.



3. But, its language abilities are seriously lacking. Its application abilities are also lacking. When I asked it to translate a passage into Korean, it called upon Google Translate. There's clearly something wrong with it.



I agree that benchmarks are an illusion.

There is definitely value that benchmarks cannot reflect.

However, it's not at a level that can be completely ignored. Looking at how it solves math problems, it's truly frighteningly intelligent.</div>

G4 is arguably the best Math based reasoning model, it also applies to physics. 
It's like the best Stem model without being best in coding.

                                <div class="reply-body">Well, this is Reddit so people just read the title. The Co-author literally says:  
&gt; This isn't simply 'LLMs for therapy is bad,' but it's asking us to think critically about the role of LLMs in therapy,[...] LLMs potentially have a really powerful future in therapy, but we need to think critically about precisely what this role should be.

And the title looks like that.

I'm quite glad with using Claude, but of course you still have the whole sycophancy issue, so you have to keep that in mind and may have to do the whole "Person A said" song and dance to get something that is not tainted by that as much.</div>

The current generation of LLMs are all inherently pretty sycophantic and default to agreeing with you. Sure, you can prompt them to be more critical (which is useful in general), but most people aren't doing that.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is how the conservative propaganda machine works in 3 simple steps.


**Step 1:** They metaphorically throw a bunch of shit at the wall:
1. Biden/dems would have released them
2. He's being threatened
3. Some 5D chess bs that will always exonerate trump
**Edit --&gt; 4. "But both sides hur dur"**

**Step 2:** They monitor which theory get the most traction on social media. 

**Step 3:** They will begin to use social media and news networks to amplify the theories that gained the most traction.


We are already seeing the narrative form. The message that is sticking is a version of "Why didn't Biden release the files if Trump was in them?".

The next step is going to be amplifying that message so that it propagates and spreads through traditional and new media and eventually his supporters will fall into lock step with the narrative.

This happens every single time.</div>

Instead of saying “I can’t” (which often sounds like there’s room to push), say “I’ve already committed to something else.” It sounds firm but polite, and people are less likely to question it. It also helps to have a reason ready in case someone does ask. It doesn’t have to be anything deep, even something like “I’ve set aside that time to recharge”...</div>
