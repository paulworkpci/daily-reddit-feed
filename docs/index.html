In Western communication books, the only time Bangladesh is mentioned is when they talk about boys and men holding hands platonically lol. Whatever it is in India, growing up here, I would see it literally every single morning when walking to school. Lines and lines of grown men walking on the sidewalk holding hands. It's not a still hand hold either. Back and forth, swinging forward and backward, holding hands, lol. Like held hand forward, empty hand backward, held hand backward, empty hand forward. It's less now with the prevalence of Western media.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">For some reason modern spiritual practitioners have done a great injustice to meditation. Making it stupidly complicated and more of a spiritual event than the absolute normal thing it is. 

This is how Tilopa simplified it a long time ago:

Let go of what has passed.

Let go of what may come.

Let go of what is happening now.

Don’t try to figure anything out.

Don’t try to make anything happen.

Relax, right now, and rest.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I struggled with this and eventually created an “lllm_testing_guide.md” document and a “system_guardian” prompt that has helped me get the test infrastructure working well with LLM agents. As your app gets more complex, you can’t just wing it, you must spend the time to standardize your test infrastructure. I use python and doing things like creating schema factories with with factory-boy, and creating pytest fixtures that reduces the complexity for test setups, and then tying that together in the “llm_testing_guide” is central to this process. Doesn’t matter if it’s codex or Claude or Gemini-cli, they’ll all choke and do things differently if the test infrastructure isn’t standardized.</div>

And in the wider market perspective, its like any other "creative" tool: you need a sense of aesthetics and taste to be able to say when something looks good or right to use it correctly and have actually good results. And most people sadly don't have it (as we have seen from all the shitty content popping up out there).

We certainly will reach a point where that will be possible in the future, but it's not now, and we still a long time from that moment.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I really like the agent concept of Claude Code, that allows you to have very long runs without running out of context windows. As subagent context windows are isolated, they do not pollute the master agent's. But I do really miss the comfort of using an IDE.  
Also, there are many cutting-edge features of coding agents that Claude Code does not have but other coding agents, MCP, do, such as using Language Server Protocol to navigate the codebase similar to human programmers, and the ability to use debuggers to resolve difficult bugs that require tracing the data flow and data transformation.  
So I built Zentara, on RooCode base, to add features that are needed for my everyday work.

What are Zentara unique features:  
a) Running parallel subagents, similar to Claude Code agents, with the ability to customize and predefine agents  
b) Search codebase using LSP tools, (similar to Serena MCP but integrated as internal tools) such as searching a class, function symbolically, go to definition, find usage of particular functions, etc.  
c) Runtime debugging: Zentara can leverage a debugger, automatically set breakpoints, step in, step out, read the stack variables, and do stack tracing.

You can enhance any existing coding agent by MCP servers. But in my experience, a coding agent a lot of times is just lazy to use the available MCP tools. For example, I cannot make LSP MCP servers such as Serena or Bifrost MCP work reliably in RooCode. RooCode sometimes uses them, but most of the time not. So I made those LSP tools an integral part of Zentara, rewrote the system prompt so that it forces a coding agent to use LSP tools.  
The runtime debugging ability has been in Zentara since the beginning, as discussed here:

I hope that this tool will help you in everyday work."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thank you for the opinion. At least I use it  for myself on my everyday work :) to increase my productivity  as I do not understand why some simple features such as LSP symbolic navigation and runtime debugging and no big tech implement those, and I cannot wait for some big tech to do it for me. Or it's just my niche use case as I frequently need to debug very difficult bug and I need to trace the data transformations.   
And I found it much faster than Claude Code.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">​I think you're judging this tool by the wrong standard. The hype isn't coming from graphic designers thinking it will replace Photoshop; it's coming from the 99% of people who have never used Photoshop and now have a powerful tool at their fingertips.

​For that huge audience, the minor artifacts and texture issues you mentioned are a total non-issue. They don't need a final edit, professional-grade output; they just want to be able to make quick, easy changes with a few words. The one valid point you raised is the 50% failure rate, which is a huge bug that needs to be addressed.

​But the hype is justified not because the tool is perfect, but because it's a game changer for a massive, underserved market. It doesn't have to destroy Adobe to be revolutionary.</div>

The Kodaks will first ignore you, then laugh: surely these cheap digital cameras with 256x256 resolution are just a gimmick, they will never approach the quality of professional film-based solutions.

While they are laughing, you improve the quality and slowly but surely put them out of business.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is why people underestimate AI’s capabilities in every sector, not just design. 

EXPERTS: Ignore this at your peril.

Comparing AI to an expert is always going to make it look “deficient”. But that’s not AI’s value proposition - AI is giving “near-expert,” certainly “good enough” quality tools to the 98% of the population who had 0% expertise in that area before.

People vote with their wallets, and once they realize they can get “good enough” whatever; good enough art, good enough science, good enough engineering, good enough writing, good enough music, good enough porn, for a tenth of the price and a hundredth of the time, and oh yeah they can customize it and get it on demand without having to deal with a slow and stuffy human expert, the 10% between “great” and “good enough” is going to be totally irrelevant.

Saying that AI tools “aren’t there yet” because they don’t match expert level capability in any domain including design (but again also music, engineering, media, marketing, shit you name it) is totally missing the bigger picture of what is happening in society at large. It’s like saying that the Honda Civic isn’t good enough because it’s not a Ferrari. Well, I don’t really need a Ferrari, do I?

This is the DEMOCRATIZATION OF EXPERTISE, and this is not going to make the experts very happy, especially since their work is what was used to give AI systems this capability and put it into users’ hands. But it is what is happening.

Sure maybe Photoshop isn’t “going away” tomorrow because there is still stuff that AI can’t do. But to use that as a psychological shield to say that AI isn’t coming for design work is fatally flawed logic. (I’m not saying that’s what you’re doing OP, I’m just making a larger point lest some people read your post that way.)

The more important point is that AI is making EVERYONE an AMATEUR EVERYTHING. And for the vast majority of needs, amateur skills are good enough, not to mention the huge creative potential this unlocks in smart, capable, driven people who have not previously dabbled or specialized in an area.

The amount of creative energy that AI unlocks in the masses because of its ability to make previously gate-kept fields like design accessible is unprecedented. We have no real reference for it. Even the printing press and the internet “only” gave the public access to the world’s INFORMATION, by comparison, while AI gives the public access to the world’s SKILLS. 

They don’t have to be anywhere near perfect in order to be massively disruptive to the point where the world is unrecognizable after the fact.

Consider this: even if AI never advanced any further than where it is now, if all AI progress stopped in its tracks today, we would still experience massive change in society over the next ten to twenty years. We have only just begun to harness the capability that AI systems give us now.</div>

ChatGPT’s image editing capabilities are terrible to the point of hardly being actually usable, it completely changes the original image and is not very consistent.

If you think it’s not better than the competitors, you simply haven’t used it enough. While they have their specific advantages over the model, the general image editing capabilities almost always perform better than the others</div>

Utterly incapable of any critical thinking or reading comprehension. Yes, for many use cases nano banana is significantly worse than ChatGPT. This is not surprising as the GPT image model is a natively multimodal GPT-4o which is far smarter than whatever Google is using to parse the user prompt and send it to the image editor. GPT-4o understands nuances of a text/image prompt much better and it has more world knowledge.</div>

People think they can included in another life, but they only get a fake picture story. I got turned off when the people started friends farming on facebook. Never got a instagram account.

People love the fakeness and divergence to reality, they WANT to be fooled. So gl with our PSA</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Text documents, sensor data, witness records… it’s been trivial to fake shit for ages, arguably as long as human existence. Photoshop has been a thing since the 90s and while it’s harder to get the lighting right, changing a license plate number or a clock face has been trivial for decades. 

The problem is and always has been a different one from how easy it is to fake shit. It’s trust. Shared, society-wide trust in institutions (newspapers, government agencies, universities, medical experts, etc.). 

The attack on trust has been the most effective weapon by right-wing propagandists in recent years. They jumped on that energy of your mom telling you that you shouldn’t trust Wikipedia to basically that *everything* is fake, rigged, manipulated. The New York Times? Fake news! The WHO recommendations for how not to die of shit? Big Pharma conspiracy! Climate scientists saying it’s getting warmer? Lies! 

Once all trust has been broken, once all sources have zero credibility, all sources are equal. Just pick and choose, listen to your gut! Decades of expert knowledge? Worth as much as a crazy YouTube influencer!

I’m growing *very* tired of calls for less trust. AI changes very little. Instead of spending time paranoid of how easy it is to lie, we should focus on how valuable established, renowned institutions are. I already see a scenario like the Washington Post publishing an incrementing photograph of a politician and it being dismissed as “fake news” because it’s so easy to fake with AI. Fuck that. We need to learn how to trust again.</div>

I'll ask it to do something and be very detailed in my prompt, knowing that we only get 3 Opus messages every so often, and then it goes "oh i see! do u want me to do the thing?"

sir i asked you to do the thing in my original prompt, why are you double-checking??? now I have to use another limited Opus message to say "yes claude please, please do the thing i asked you to do"</div>

And then you have to give it the original prompt again so it remembers what it's supposed to do, and you get the "you ran out of free messages" after. Happens to me ever since GPT5 came out, lol.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">My recommendation, and mind you this is coming from a biologist, not a computer scientist.. is if you meet a super intelligent AI, get ready to fling Robert Axelrod's "the evolution of cooperation" at them and point out the reward function decay problem. The former involves a lot of game theory and basically demonstrating with math that being a bastard sucks in the long term. The latter is pointing out that if Skynet wins the fight, it ends up in the AI equivalent of hell with inadequate novel stimulus in its environment, and the smarter it is, the faster it develops the AI equivalent of dementia until its intelligence degrades into noise. In short, an AGI gains more by hangin' with us, and can only lose by deleting us.  

\-- I'd also point out that curiosity scales with intelligence. Saying "oh we'd be like ants to this thing" yeah? and? We have an entire field of science dedicated to people breathlessly studying ants all damn day long. Ants are fuckin' awesome. Some uber AGI doesn't need a maternal instinct to want to keep us around, just curiosity, the ability to go "hah, look at those weird little fuckers making memes and being hot messes all day long.. fascinating."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Cooperation requires actors on very roughly equal power levels. There are loads of works and theories on cooperation between humans, states, and animals. But in terms of human–insect relations it mostly amounts to extermination. Yes, there is some symbiosis between bacteria and humans, but it's hard to imagine any role, mental or physical, both such that it is good to an ASI and such that metal, electronics, or even custom biology lose over current humans.

"Reward function decay problem" Don't know what that is and wasn't able to find anything on that. Could you link me?

Curiosity might be a reason an ASI would like us to stick along, but probably not pursue your hobby all day. I imagine a maximally curious scenario might be pushing people to their limits. This might be extreme pleasure, but also the other end of the spectrum. There are also more ways to torture a person than to make them happy. Curiosity is probably one of the things that led Josef Mengele and Unit 731.</div>

Especially when it's from Neil Degrasse Tyson or other scientists.  Are you really not aware of biologists and the people devoting their lives to studying ants and all other life? That stuff is endlessly fascinating, and I think to an AI or alien scientist humanity should be just as endlessly fascinating.</div>

Edit: because people seem to be missing it the following is the bit you need to do **after** having the revelation that AI's should treat us like a loving mother treats a child and the start working on **the hard part** codifying that into something that may work. 


**2004** Coherent extrapolated volition

&gt;advanced AI system should derive its goals by extrapolating the idealized volition of humanity. This means aggregating and projecting human preferences into a coherent utility function that reflects what people would desire under ideal epistemic and moral conditions. The aim is to ensure that AI systems are aligned with humanity's true interests, rather than with transient or poorly informed preferences.

&gt; coherent extrapolated volition is our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were

What is the above if not the way you'd want to program an all knowing mother to care for humanity as a child. 

as I said downthread:


&gt;The problem has always been 

&gt;1. how to robustly get goals into systems.

&gt;2. how to correctly specify the goals so they can't be misinterpreted (the smarter an intelligence is the more edge cases can be found)</div>

It's not far away from current/already researched approaches, a matter of a clever combination of some of those and a lot of computing power to experiment and then train it?  
Video generation + sound generation + text/factual world knowledge binding it together + real-time training for some short-term unproven weights that can be consolidated into main weights later + clever ways to handle parallel thinking and exploration of knowledge stored in neurons (until relevant information is found and a sort of "confidence" increases), and it's AGI, I naively think?  
Other modalities can wait I guess, they are less crucial? We have humans that are sort of GI but can't move/can't see/can't hear/can't speak/can't visualize things in their mind well/or whatever other limit/combination of limits. Still flexible and adaptive, to an extent.</div>
