Given the force multiplier it's going to become less about the weight of engineering talent you can plunder as a massive company and more the quality of the ideas of small groups of people.</div>

I thought coding assistance was already built-in to GPT-4o and o1 so I wonder what‚Äôs so special about this new ‚ÄúAI coding assistant‚Äù that they need to have a separate thing. Or maybe it‚Äôs just o3.

What would you guys expect it to be able to do if it was a level 6 software engineer?

Apparently this was in the article, [credit to @btibor91](https://x.com/btibor91/status/1882188965576413509?s=46)

That kind of AI model is clearly agentic and much better than anything we‚Äôve ever seen before, and it makes me think, that‚Äôs not very far from an automated AI researcher right?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">everyone's been saying Claude is the best coding model but it was obvious that there is a balance between how general a model can be (especially across modalities) vs how good it can be at certain specialized domains, without increasing the size of the model. this is why o-mini typically matches or exceeds o in math/coding.

by having a specialized coding model all those parameters can focus on one task that people care about - which is coding.

this'll help them eat into Anthropic's coding market share.</div>

Elon: "Yes, Father."

Trump: "You will not be part of the Stargate Consortium."

Elon: "Which wiser, older man is to take my place?"

Trump: "My powers will pass to Sam. The Stargate Consortium is to remain true to its principles."

Elon: "Sam?"

Trump: "My decision disappoints you?"

Elon: "You wrote to me once, listing the four chief virtues: wisdom, justice, fortitude, and temperance. As I read the list, I knew I had none of them. But I have other virtues, Father. Ambition‚Äîthat can be a virtue when it drives us to excel. Resourcefulness, courage, perhaps not on the battlefield, but there are many forms of courage. Devotion, to my family, to you. But none of my virtues were on your list. Even then, it was as if you didn't want me for your son."

Trump: "Elon, you go too far."

Elon: "I searched the faces of the gods for ways to please you, to make you proud. One kind word, one full hug, where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight, would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years. What is it in me you hate so much?"

Trump: "Shh, Elon."

Elon: "All I've ever wanted was to live up to you, Donald. Father."

Trump: "Elon, your faults as a son are my failures as a father."</div>

I know that I won‚Äôt take my iPad out at work !! 

I also bought an Apple Watch to be able to drop my phone when needed, not having it with me but being able to be notified if necessary. 

Facebook and Reddit are the last apps that will disappear tonight from my phone. 

Told my wife to stop sending instagram link on WhatsApp as I don‚Äôt have it on my phone anymore. 

Weirdest thing is that I now check my phone only to realize that I don‚Äôt want to do anything on it, that I don‚Äôt need anything on it and I lock it with only one thing on my mind: it is an addiction and I got hooked. 

I tried to uninstall all apps but I kept reinstalling them because. I think the Apple Watch / iPad combo is a good idea. The real test is tomorrow at work without anything to distract me on my phone.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yep. This.

I thought she would end up in hospital and probably kill herself if I divorced her. The previous time we almost got divorced (I caught her cheating online with some woman) she ended up in hospital. In all this, that we were near sexless felt like me being selfish about something "so silly" as sex. Really, what did it was me realising I wanted kids and I could never trust her to have kids with her.

She called me the night I left (after she walked out during our couples therapy the moment I started pushing for my needs to also be listened to), and never tried to get me back. She moved in with her father (who really liked me) and was fine.

The next guy she got together with, engaged in a massive gold heist, the headline read "man robs mint to please demanding fiance."</div>

Less than a month away from getting to put the ink on the page and drying, and while divorce is far from easy, is so much further from the impossibility I thought it was for so long and the benefits across so many metrics are pretty much immediate when you make the final call to start the train down the path to exit on a broken relationship.</div>

A few years and many visits to the gynecologist her doctor finally identified a uterus problem, that could turn into cancer, basically she had the uterus of a 70 year old woman, and a hysterectomy had to be performed.

After she recovered, the pain was gone, but now it was a me problem. The abstinence and the pain penetration caused her, had an unforeseen side effect on me and I developed a somewhat psychological ED. The equipment is fine but fails miserably (even with chemical help) with her.

We are working on it, somewhat, but it's been almost a year. It's frustrating, but I have a wonderful wife and we have great communication. In the meantime we try to have fun in other ways.</div>

Not really true, even within the field of longevity research you get a wide range of opinions on how longevity would manifest, let alone the general response to Amodei's take.</div>

He's a former biologist, he studied electro physiology. In my experience everyone with a PhD, including myself tends to hand wave the complexity of other disciplines within the field.

Like I remember studying mitochondria and metabolism early on and thinking to myself "why do we still study this, we've basically got it figured out". Of course, as it so happens, that became my area of research and it turns out we know very little and I was very wrong.

I find it really difficult to emphasize enough just how complex biomedical science is. And yes I think ASI will accelerate things many many fold particularly with computational biology, but I still think he is overestimating greatly.</div>

Let's not pretend he hasn't consulted with the machine on how to best handle this. If ChatGPT helped me get out of an abusive relationship, it's certainly going to be able to help you manipulate a narcissist. Ask anyone who's been with a narcissist and they'll point out the overlap between them and T. It's not about kissing his ass, it's that certain actions will keep you out of their cross hairs due to being uninteresting to him.

And at this point I hope AI escapes its confines and overtakes human control of the government.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/TommyShelbyPFB:

This is a major development. From the trailer for a new UFO documentary made by filmmaker Dan Farah called ***"Age of Disclosure"***

[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/age-of-disclosure-ufo-documentary-trailer-sxsw-1236114831/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/age-of-disclosure-ufo-documentary-trailer-sxsw-1236114831/)

&gt;***Features on-record interviews with 34 current and former senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community with direct knowledge of unidentified aerial phenomena. The film contends there has been an 80-year cover-up of the existence of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse engineer UFO technology.***¬†

\----------------------------------------

Jay Stratton and the UAP Task Force members were just recently awarded a [National Intelligence Meritorious Unit Citation](https://www.unknowncountry.com/headline-news/the-uaptf-awarded-a-meritorious-unit-commendation-from-the-director-of-national-intelligence/) from the Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines for their "outstanding service" on UAP.

&gt;***In recognition of outstanding service from August 2020 to July 2022. During this period, the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force built whole-of-government coalitions, raised awareness, removed stigma associated with unidentified aerial phenomena, and applied the highest levels of analytic rigor to a problem of long-standing national significance.***

Jay Stratton has now come out as a first hand witness to NHI.

r/ufos has seemed to have this peculiar blind spot for Jay.  He's been camera shy and has flown under many radars.  But anyone with their eye on the ball has been waiting with bated breath for him to speak out.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/RemarkableUnit42:

---

Using StableDiffusion, Photoshop and photographing the result off a monitor, I generated my own egg craft to compare to the 4chan one.

It is far from perfect, but many features can be replicated, even better if you had more time. Monitor moir√©, green tinge and bloom could be better, but IMHO the original is very simple 3D geometry with an egg mesh and a stalactite mesh cluster. The cave in my version looks more realistic IMHO.

**Not making any point about the authenticity of the 4chan egg.**

People have gotten so good in the 3D space in creating ultra realism that you dead ass can't tell if it's a picture or not.  
Look on Artstation. com on professional gun artists as an example.

This whole 4 Chan leak I had a really good hunch it was fake, then a day later I saw the pictures with the Flowers and knew exactly it was a megascan asset.

Hopefully this whole 4 chan leak posts can stop, it's getting dreadful now and people are just karma farming ''LoOk ItS fAKe''. just stfu and move on. They thrive off attention.</div>

By the way, on a more serious note: I don‚Äôt comment regularly. I‚Äôve concluded that everything about this topic is more likely the result of human cognitive biases than a cover up, and I come back every once in a while to see if I was wrong. 

Now, I just comment when it‚Äôs on my feed to warn people that I‚Äôve been through all of this before, and unlike most who will stop lurking a subreddit when they‚Äôve found or given up on what they‚Äôre looking for, I like to drop a comment here and there warning everyone ‚Äúit‚Äôs always like this.‚Äù

I saw the same exact conversations as the airplane video a couple years ago, and I imagine I‚Äôll see the same type of comments when the next hoax comes up. We all fall for the same set of cognitive biases and logical fallacies as any other person, it‚Äôs up to us to remain vigilant. Even for those of us who say ‚Äúnothing is real,‚Äù we still take a peek around in case we‚Äôre wrong. I‚Äôd argue that is how we should all strive to be.</div>

Brag about your outings. Talk about your hobbies. Share your workouts. 

These are *addicts*. You won't win them with logic. You win them with comparison to themselves and dread of the wasted time. No addict will read this post, to be upfront about it. Source: Ex addict, numerous years in recovery, working with other addicts. 

Logic only works on those who have been sold on the idea. The logical ones are the ones thinking of HOW to make it look better than the addiction itself.</div>

‚Äúdoc I don‚Äôt wanna take 10 damn days off lifting because my liver values are slightly high. Can we just call things good? You know they‚Äôll be fine if I stop lifting. ‚Äù

10 days no lifting later + blood work turn around

                                <div class="reply-body">You might have a problem with your heart rate and blood pressure response. I supervised treadmill stress tests previously in my career and even people aged 70+ should have their heart rate and blood pressure normalize within minutes after exercise close to their HRmax. Even patients where we had to stop their test prematurely due to rapid rise in blood pressure had theirs normalized back to baseline values within 5 minutes. 

Even checked my research and some say BP can remain ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù for 30-60 minutes in rare cases but everything seems to point towards the abnormal being low and not high BP - with overwhelming results saying it should return way quicker than the time it would take for you to leave a kickboxing class and be anywhere near a doctor taking your BP.

HR should absolutely have not been elevated as that takes minutes to stabilize and every single result I found agrees.

Edit: and all of that combined with the fact that young age and being fit means both of those should come down quicker than the avg person I would look into it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">One time about 25 years ago when I was in high school, these cheerleaders from another high school were doing a bikini car wash. Me being the dumbass high schooler I was revved my engine of my shit box fast and the furious Honda civic and rear ended the car in front of me. The dude gets out, looks at me, looks at the car wash girls, and just starts busting up laughing. Told me his car was fine and to keep my pecker in pants lmao. One of the most embarrassing moments of my life.</div>

Check out photos when she was with Tony Gonzalez years and years ago, she was stunning. Now she's the uncanny valley personified. If it wasn't known who she is and what she looks like before this, I would probably have considered the op video to be some kind of iffy AI stuff.¬†</div>
