Lets be real, like with most interesting guests that have any sort of thought that deviates from whatever Stephen Colbert thinks, the comments will be filled with the same repeating spam words, “muh grifter”, “muh nazi”, “muh fascist”, “muh conspiracy brainrot”.

                                <div class="reply-body">The problem with UBI is that it doesn't solve much on its own. The studies on UBI are not effective in seeing how it would work because if you give trial UBI to like 1000 people, it only simulates the real world if every single place those 1000 people buy from KNOW they have the extra money.

So in the real world, the actual effect of UBI that all  business owners will be aware is being distributed will just be inflation, like always when workers make more money.

The reality is that we only look at UBI because the wages most people are paid and the prices we spend those wages on are controlled by the capitalist class.

Passing UBI doesn't stop employers from controlling those things. UBI would have to he accompanied by things like single payer Healthcare, public housing, lots of things that take that power away from capitalists by making certain resources public with no profit incentive

I know people want to hope UBI will work, but the harsh reality is that it's CAPITALISM that isn't working for most people, and UBI doesn't take power away from capitalists.</div>

Or some might want to work in some sectors of the service industry - like bartending can be a blast.

Large, very bright orb flying quickly across the sky. I’m currently trying to get more answers on it from the one who recorded it. They messaged me back the time and location when I asked when and where this was filmed. Still waiting to see if they’ll send me the original or let me know if there was any direct noise associated with it.

Time: 1/7/25 around 7:00pm UTC+8, China Standard Time (CST)

Location: Hebei, China

That being said, unless the landing lights are pointing at the viewer, I wouldn't expect it to look like that. It's also weird, that this many apparent residential buildings would be so close to an airport. And I haven't found any news of an airplane going down elsewhere in the region in the last few days (but I also didn't search much and english media only)</div>

This sub is still surprising me on the assumption that they will never have to work for millennium and just assume the cosmos are going to roll over and let them sit on their ass for all of eternity.

My instagram stopped showing my all the cool amazing stuff I was into from years ago, and Im kind of happy for it. 
I follow almost 5000 accounts and only get shown like 20.

Now its all reels, had a great night of laughter a couple nights ago scrolling.

But still the way I perceive the world feels fundamentally different. Completely brain rotted.</div>

I specifically wanted to read books instead of social media. So I started to read more and do social media less, and I did it little by little. There is hope. It is like a muscle, and the more you use it the more you will be able to be stronger and get your attention span back. You can do this.</div>

"America is a golden calf and we will suck it dry, chop it up, and sell it off piece by piece until there is nothing left but the world's biggest welfare state that we will create and control. Why? Because it is the will of God, and America is big enough to take the hit so we can do it again and again and again. This is what we do to countries that we hate. We destroy them very slowly and make them suffer for refusing to be our slaves."

I suppose that some authentication will have to be in place to ensure that these agents are who they say they are, but today people fall for phishing scams that are not that sophisticated when compared with an AI agent talking to you from your slack channel, something that can snuck into one meeting, conversation or message thread and seems to know what it's talking about.

                                <div class="reply-body">Two-factor identification is a lot more important. We might have to move to three-factor identification.

* Something you know (like a password)
* Something you are (fingerprint, face recognition -  that sort of thing)
* Something you have (keycard, phone RFID chip)

None of that really matters. Like all other hacking, the safest bet is always social engineering. You're going to know it comes from "Joe from engineering", because Joe gave you a call and confirmed it.
But the Joe that called was also the agent. Spoofing a voice and phone number is already trivial. Working from home is going to go away for a lot of businesses, but this time for a good reason. We can't trust that it's you we're talking to unless you're physically present.</div>

Went cold turkey because I kept hearing things like, “Your energy levels will improve,” and “You’ll feel less anxious,” and so on. All these promises.

Guess what? Nothing changed. I was just constantly tired, stuck at an energy level of like 3 or 4 out of 10 the whole time.

So I decided to start drinking coffee again a couple days ago, and wow! Instant improveme...</div>

Personally, even though I only drink 1 cup a day, skipping just one day gives me a headache like clockwork. So I prefer to let myself keep it as a daily habit, but just limit the intake amount.

Try to be strict with it! I generally treat 2 cups as my absolute upper limit, for days when I'm really exhausted for some reason.</div>

If you take the weekends off, you're going to get some knarly withdrawl headaches. For me, if I stop drinking caffeine after 24 hours I start getting headaches, big ones.</div>

I feel the same but sometimes I sort of wish I was never around for any of it, because if I was introduced to devices &amp; the internet today, they wouldn't have been so addicting. Everything about them is boring!</div>

I remember typing lessons in the 90s, like literal typewriter lol, it was SLIGHTLY digital/computerised, since you'd type a line and get a lcd preview then it'd type it when you hit enter.   A wierd crossover tech, the best of typewriters and just before word processing software on early OS.   It was an interesting time of technological change...  

As transient as the tech was, it served me well and I learned to touch type within a few months.   So when Win 3.1 &gt; 95 etc came along, I was ready</div>

Im not a fan of the smartphone ecosystem, but I actually wish I could plug my phone into a USB c dock and use it as a desktop. Portable when I need it, a full desktop when I need to work.</div>

If they can be replaced, what does that mean for the rest of us? Most of us are out here taking Adderall just to tackle a laundry day and working remote, aka a solid 3-hour workday.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If you're imagining jobs _as they are_ being automated by AI, I think that's an incomplete picture. Sure, ChatGPT plus a little training could probably field an awful lot of banking telephone customer service calls right now.

But widen the scope a little. It's not difficult to imagine an awful lot of the physical, in-person jobs that ChatGPT can't do yet, going away too...because what do you even need a physical bank teller at a physical bank branch for, if enough of your customers transition to online banking?

There's potential here for entire industries to collapse not merely because Ai can do the jobs that exist, but because assumptions about the work needing to be done in the first place could fall apart entirely. When was the last time you bought a paper map, for example? Google maps didn't reduce the need for human labor in paper map making. It eliminated the need for paper maps.</div>

I agree. I've often pointed out to doomers that Open Source keeping up with Big Tech AI, points to a future where AI &amp; robotics is decentralized &amp; in wide-ownership.</div>

If in the limit offence is favoured then putting incredibly powerful and intelligent systems in everyone's pocket with no ability to restrict bad uses might end up being even worse... 

Since that type of decentralized unregulated AI seems pretty much inevitable at this point I guess we just have to hope that the ASIs owned by the biggest corporations and countries are competent enough to deal with unprecedented levels of cyber attacks, bioterrorism, etc.</div>

There's a good argument that AI will actually free us up to do all these human things more than ever. That we...</div>

However, it sucks that some people abuse it so much and use it to poison the internet. As an artist, I try to post less online and focus more on offline practices.

The current AI situation is bad, but I hope this will make more people get bored of the internet and spend more time with real life instead.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Not AI specifically but I've been fighting meaningless content (AI slop is the biggest culprit), brainrot, content that diminishes my attention span, etc. lately after becoming self conscious with how easily i become bored now.

I'm around 40 and I'm getting legitimately nostalgic for the way life was before smartphones and being connected to the outside world 24/7. I miss the 90s and early 00s, being content alone with an evening of programming and no way to reach me. Watching slow paced media and not getting bored and eventually bringing up my phone.

I've been forcing myself to watch more slow and meticulous movies and TV shows (I'm 5 eps into Twin Peaks 1990 and I love it) to build back up my attention span. And dialogue/text heavy games (Disco Elysium and Rogue Trader still on my plate). Also trying to avoid watching the same comforting crap I've seen dozens of times and can basically "watch" in my head whenever I want)

I gotta say it actually feels good. I feel less depressed with no more evenings scrolling YT trying to find something satisfying, or scrolling my phone endlessly with background noise. I'm also including my wife so we do more than sit next to eachother and look at our phones. I feel more clear headed and able to focus on things. Also, when I do feel like watching YouTube, it's fine because it's one of many activities instead of all I do.</div>

I too have been seeking to slow things down and dramatically reduce all the context-switching I've become accustomed to in work and life over the past two decades. Like you, I want my pre-internet attention back.

I try to do more analog activities too, to help remind me that there's life outside of screens.

                        <div class="comment-body">I work in a creative field (video production).  I use ChatGPT on rare occasions like when I need to update my website copy or write the occasional long but optimized social media caption that I don’t want to write.

But, I avoid generative AI.  Voiceovers, B-roll, photo generation, etc.  I get clients with small budgets who just want me to make them an AI video for marketing, but that’s not what I do.  I’m in the business of working with humans to build human connection and human trust to help get the word out and sell their products or services.  A lot of my work may look like a corporate, bland thing, but there’s still an art form to it, and if I take the actual art and craft out of what I do, it loses soul and meaning and vastly devalues my work.  I enjoy doing what I do, and I’m not in the interest of letting AI replace what I do.

I’m all for AI tools to make my job easier and let me focus on the meat and potatoes of my work, but not for outright replacing what I do.  I want AI to get rid of tasks I want to do so I can keep doing art, not get rid of art so I can focus on tasks I don’t want to do.</div>

He got up and left. We assumed it was because he was tired of us always making fun of him wanting to be an Iron Chef — he watched it all the time.

Nope, his ass came back with groceries and made us a fucking short rib dish that I still think about to this day. And this was 22 years ago.</div>

No but seriously this will eventually become a massive market so it’s not surprising.

                                <div class="reply-body">It's a funny statement, but in defense of Bill Gates, there is no evidence that he ever said it.  In fact, at the time the new processor could support 1MB of virtual address space.  IBM was proposing to split that in half: 500k for the operating system kernel, and 500k for the user mode application. 

Gates realized that applications were going to need as much memory as possible, so he proposed reserving 640k for the apps, leaving just over 300k for the OS.

I always find it amusing that he was the one thinking ahead and trying to get as much memory for applications as possible, yet it somehow got turned around on him and used as a joke for decades after about how seemingly short-sighted he was.</div>
