Only on the Plus plan, not doing crazy usage, but have yet to hit any limits. Will see how it goes for the rest of the week, but damn so far so good.


UPDATE - Wow, the CLI limits are shit. Hit my WEEKLY limit in well under 10 hours total running only 1 agent at a time. Still able to use Codex web though, so ...</div>

I'm up to $475/mo. I'll grant you I'm working multiple clients at once. Throw in a discount for days off and slow days.. $300/mo.

The client facing side operated like this. Everyone knew our meetings were expensive. That didn't mean we didn't have meetings. It meant our meetings had purpose and left with next steps. Everybody that needed to be there was there or it didn't happen so decisions could be made.

When I went internal it's like the company forgot how to run a simple project. I shit you not I would have meeting with my peer in some other department. We would both have a meeting with our boss to convey that and they would have a meeting with theirs. And that got filtered back down to us. Such an insane waste of time and money.</div>

Mindfulness is NOT about controlling your experience, or *changing* your thinking. It's about *being with* whatever is arising in this moment. It's opening and embracing. 

We are always striving to change and control things in our workdays, and when we take that ambitious way of solving problems into our mindfulness practice, it can really make our practice super STRICT and not enjoyable. 

What is another key detail that not enough people are needing to hear?</div>

Because everyone now sits on the FORWARD half of the pad, they slide INTO the foot plate section. They should be on the BACK half of the pads, so that gravity pulls them AWAY. 

That’s why when it broke, he slide down the front. If your GHD breaks, you should absolutely fall off the back.</div>

They don't have to try to predict which way you are going based on your eyes movement anymore, and you can both just make a decision and avoid each other.

                                <div class="reply-body">Passing by someone at work walking the other way? Always. Let’s them know I mean business and I’m the king of the hall way. Sometimes I give a loud “HOWDY” or an “Almost Friday eh?” like I am actually better than them and feel some sort of empathy for the strife they face every day of their miserable repetitive lives. Like I know all the answers. Like I am the only person truly happy. It keeps the demons away. Keeps me thinking that my life is ok compared to these people. Then, later, when they’ve turned a corner. That is when I come to grips with the monster that I am. The monster I must seem to all people. How dare I act as if I am above them. As if I know the secret to joy and happiness. And how dare I treat them as such. How dare I let my internal hatred of myself not rule my thoughts for one second. But, in the end. I realize that maybe, just maybe,  my jovial attitude brightened their day a little bit. Maybe it made them realize “Yeah, it IS almost Friday”. And then on their drive home, instead of just staring ahead and decompressing before they have to face their family, always at the cusp of bringing their rage and despair home to them. Maybe instead, they smile into the sun, and sing. 

Anyway, what were we talking about?</div>

At Tesla there was a software engineer within the autopilot team that downloaded a shit ton of code. Trying to remember if he used a usb stick or he just airdropped it to himself.

                        <div class="comment-body">I honestly find it's more about the number of turns in your conversation. 

I've dropped huge 800k token documentation for new frameworks (agno) which Gemini was not trained on.

And it is spot on with it. It doesn't seem to be RAG to me.

But LLM sessions are kind of like old yeller. After a while they start to get a little too rabid and you have to take them out back and put them down. 

But the bright side is you just press that "new" button and you get a bright happy puppy again.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I've noticed that too. The smarter models can remain coherent for longer, but they all eventually develop some weird repetitive phrases or styles that they always come back to and refuse to stop. If you keep chatting, they'll fall deeper down the rabbit hole until the chat is garbage.

For coding, I've found that new chats are almost always better than continuing anything 5 or 6 prompts deep. It's a little different for GPT-5 Pro where it feels like it's solid so long as the prompt is good.</div>

I've read books well over 1M tokens, I think (*It*, for example), and at the time I had a very clear idea of the world, characters, and everything related, at any point in the story. I didn't remember what happened word by word, and a second read helped with some little foreshadowing details, but I don't get confused like any AI does.

Edit: checking, 'It' is given around 440.000 words, so probably exactly around 1M tokens. Maybe a bit more.</div>

But I have to say Gemini. I use the deep research to make a text on subjects and then NotebookLM to turn that into a podcast or overview video (in essence a narrated powerpoint). It requires good prompting, but works great for me. I easily get 40-60 min good podcasts out of it.

The few times I tried chatgpt deep research for the same topics it just stayed superficial. Refused to dig deep.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Limits remain: The demo connected two buildings a kilometer apart. We still can’t amplify unknown quantum states, so long-haul scaling needs quantum repeaters/quantum memories and entanglement swapping—none of which are solved at production scale. Penn explicitly notes long-distance scaling as the main barrier.

For the ecosystem: it’s meaningful. It shows that standard IP-style networking can coexist with quantum traffic on existing fiber using a manufacturable silicon photonics chip. That lowers integration risk for telecoms and invites larger pilots (multi-node meshes, inter-operator trials). Expect more city-scale testbeds and alignment work with networking standards groups; still, true intercity networking needs quantum repeaters/memories and end-to-end entanglement swapping—none of which this result solves.

                                <div class="reply-body">Do you really think they’re gonna do universal basic income?

We’re so greedy as humans that they’re gonna pocket that money instead of keeping people fed and alive.

Just look at what they’re doing right now with every single opportunity that they have to better people, they decide to just pocket the money.

The real debate here isn’t whether their universal basic income as possible, the debate is whether human failures will allow us to care about another human as much as everybody wants us to

Edit - fam I say this with a lot of love but you all need to step out of your bubble and zoom out and look at everything holistically.

You all have survivorship bias, where you think the way the world you experience it is the way that other people experience it.

One of the arguments in my comments is that if we can have access to free, clean, drinking water, then we can have access to UBI

If you didn’t know this, I think only 70% of the world has access to free and clean drinking water. 

If we can’t even give the world free and clean, drinking water, what makes anybody think we can do UBI? 

And before you say That’s “Third World countries”

The United States, the branded greatest company/country in the world only has 97% access to clean and free drinking water LOL. 

So please take time to step out of your bubble and look at things from the perspective of other people. It’s gonna save you a lot mental gymnastics.</div>

People in the service industry, medical personnel, and infrastructure don't get that luxury. A national holiday for election day mostly benefits white collar workers and wealthy people.

College is not just vocational training, it teaches you how to think critically, examine your sources, do research, solve problems, all of which you will want and need. It’s also fun and a chance to meet lifelong friends from places you’ve never been, broaden your perspectives, challenge your biases, cultivate personal discipline and independence

Who are you working for post-singularity? Why do they need you to work exactly? At what are you beating a super-intelligent species? Do you want a dog to do your taxes? How come dogs get free lunches? I can understand a fear of AI not needing us and getting rid of us, but the idea you would be working for gods is hilarious.

                        <div class="comment-body">Going to college as a traditional student is becoming a thing of the past. Let go of that expectation. Consider taking a year in college but maintain your flexibility. Keep your schooling cost low and learn to network. Don’t fixate on the quality of the schools. All accredited courses stick to similar standards. Ultimately, it’s the student’s responsibility to learn, not the school’s to teach. So, don’t stress about committing to a degree. Spot opportunities when they arise. College is an excellent place to discover such opportunities. Stay flexible because no one knows what will happen.</div>
