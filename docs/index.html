                <div class="post-content">Chris Simon is best known for calling AI a [hype-fueled dumpster fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bF_AQvHs1M).

Despite the spicy title of his talk above, his views around AI are quite nuanced. After researching the "LLM supply chain", including the process for how these models are trained and reinforced, he made an ethical decision to not engage with them at all – but he's still aware of the potential upsides, and charts a likely path forward after the hype bubble has died down.

                        <div class="comment-body">The issue is that he is looking at the hype bubble from game devs and thinking that is what people on the ground think, and the reason why no one has actually tried to make an AI game yet is because the technology is not there, but it is getting close. The complexity and duration of tasks that AI is able to do is increasingly getting better, especially in the first 16k context window.

He is also mistaking people DREAMING with hype, pushing things to their natural conclusions and seeing what this tech can actually do. Just because a delusional CEO is pushing for it doesn't mean that people on the lower levels are not grounded.

He made a lot of weird statements in this video that makes me question if he is just a doomer for the grift. He likes to just brush off 'context window' to dismantle the entire argument for LLMs in the first place, or worse, making statements that were true a year ago but are no longer true today.

'They cannot DM a DnD game' is, uhh, a big statement to make, especially since people are already making DnD campaigns with them, and have, for two years. Sure, there is issues, and it isn't perfect, but god damn, most PEOPLE without a lot of experience cannot do it.

'They are not very creative' is a true statement, but only if you don't realize that a lot of models are being trained for benchmarks and not actual real world tasks. Kimi K2 proved that LLMs can have both, with many variable ways of writing things and do good at a multitude of tasks.

These things are only 10% the size of a prefrontal cortex, actually more like 1% the size if you go by the complexity of a neuron compared to a parameter. We haven't even tried scaling to the size of a tenth part of our brain. We do not know how well these things scale after 10 trillion parameters, we do not know a LOT of things about them yet. It is like looking at the first automobiles and going, 'but it doesn't go faster than me running' with a smug little shit eating grin.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The context window thing is definitely silly; human brains have very very smol context windows. Set something down in a place you don't normally set things down at, and see how long it sticks in there.

The last round of scaling was comparable to a squirrel's brain, while the SOTA current round coming online is human scale. There's more basic faculties to build out inside of RAM, as well as getting better at having the things handle concepts across multiple domain types of data.

As always, scale maximalists will be right about everything always: everything follows from there. With a substrate capable of running a mind, you can have anything. Without that physical substrate, you have nothing.

This isn't just about skepticism. It's about a fundamental misunderstanding of the trajectory we're witnessing in real-time.


There's a world of difference between corporate hype and actual progress on the ground. While pessimists cherry-pick statements from overeager CEOs, they're completely overlooking engineers who are methodically pushing these boundaries further every single quarter.


This isn't just about optimism versus pessimism. It's about recognizing the difference between thoughtful exploration and cynical dismissal based on yesterday's limitations.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's a regression to the mean for whatever you ask, so if it's serving something unique, it's likely the result of additional work, human research, or new ideas injected into the prompting. (But lots of people don't do that!) 

One of the points that comes up a little later in the chat is how to move prompting away from the mean, pushing it into lesser used activation areas. And each one of these sub-prompts will have its own sub regression to the mean response. But through several unique prompts and mash-ups, you can approach something novel and hopefully communicate what you wanted. As Simon says, wielding the LLM as if it were a paintbrush or a pen.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">it is true, i have played dnd and other text story based games with llm's since the beginning. i have used them all. there is absolutely zero creativity or ability to foreshadow(this is a major hurdle that NEEDS to be solved). nearly everything is the same, including the same 10 names. the only improvement so far are certain words are not as overused as before. they are not remotely close to ready for video games or novels. anyone that says otherwise have not used them extensively for storytelling. not a storytelling assistant, but an actual storyteller.

2.5 pro has the best prose and sonnet has by _far_ the least amount of metaphor/simile slop. both are still terrible at storytelling with no creativity. this is because there is a total reset with each prompt sent. there is no thought or idea(hidden from reader) to be built up page to page. creativity and foreshadowing is just not possible with the way they work currently. this is not even including it tries to give you the most likely scenarios, which is the antithesis of creativity itself.

we are not even close. not unless they change how llms work.</div>

In the event description, list 2–3 things you absolutely need to move today. When that block starts, that’s all you do. No email, no chat, no “quick question.”

every time i hit run, i whisper “please” like it’s a prayer.
it’s never about logic it’s about emotional resilience.

today i fixed a bug that’s been haunting me for 3 days. the fix? one missing parenthesis.
even cosine and chatgpt didn’t catch it. i just stared at the screen long enough to see the truth.</div>

AI coding agents are amazing, but they make really basic mistakes all the time. Often they are simple and easy to fix, but you’re more likely to catch them manually than by asking the agent. The agent will try to refactor the entire project before it just looks for the simple mistakes.

Once it got past 1000 lines I was sweating when I wanted to add a feature or fix something that wasn’t broken. 

Eventually I had to venture on my own and read docs and use knowledge from other languages to fix it. 

So maybe those vibe coders are employed by said AI company and don’t really have large projects, are extremely lucky, or lying. Haha</div>

I've had significant wastes of time due to naivety and the models inability to understand their capabilities (I trusted them too much too). I've also learned a huge amount and now better understand important fundamentals. I expect I have learned to produce working code far faster than traditionally, and am able to take shortcuts and learn what shortcuts I *can* take and where the models need to be restrained.

It might be the case that there are some advantages to learning from scratch for a novice vs learning with the assumptions baked in from being an expert (albeit the pros obviously significantly outweigh the cons).</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is the most obvious CIA hit of all time by the way. 

  
Boeing designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, and missiles worldwide... making it the favorite child of the Pentagon. 

If this guy is allowed to expose how shitty of a job the company is doing putting airplanes together right now, then the rest of the world will just switch to the European airplane manufacturer Airbus whenever they want to buy a 747. That would cost Boeing tens of billions of dollars each year, dramatically impeding their ability to design and manufacturer what the Pentagon wants. 

This guy was trying to keep us all safe by shining light on the shitty standards on the production line that was causing all of their planes to fall apart, and was killed by the military industrial complex for it.</div>

You break up a big company if it has 2 independent products/businesses that together create monopoly pricing power but can otherwise operate as separate businesses. You can't break up a big company that does 1 thing. You can only destroy such a company. His commitment to ideology without understanding how the real world works has made him into a wrecking ball.

Stop worrying about falling birthrates! Most global problems become easier to manage if we get rid of the consumers! 

No need for war, or gas chambers, or anything! Just allow robots to replace people slowly as they retire! 

We could, literally, just adjust the retirement age down and the IQ limit for social security up, slowly, as robots take jobs, such that we're pulling people out of the workforce at the same rate that robots are entering it. 

Corporate greed and oligarchs who want to be kings are the only real threats here!</div>

I work in software/AI and I'm not one of the people smart enough to wedge themselves into somewhere like OpenAI to get a payoff. But even when you see "AI researcher gets 10m bonus!!!" wow! Who gaf, because you can guarantee for those actually at the top, 10m pales in comparison to what they're getting.


There will be no jobs. And the majority of human beings will have nothing to do. Hopefully I'll still have work to do - but I'm terrified for the rest of us. I don't want to live in a world like that. Technology has never been the problem, evolved greed and resource contention has. </div>

                <div class="post-content">I feel like most practitioners on this subreddit are stuck in the practice of 10-20 mins meditation a few times a week.

Which is very good, but having done that myself for a very long time, I did not experience the incredible changes that meditation can actually bring. I had to increase to one hour, then later twice one hour, to see actual great progress.

The problem with a 10-20 mins practice is that this is usually the amount of time during a meditation session where your mind unclutters.

                        <div class="comment-body">Great advice. I always try to tell people exactly this.

10-20 is better than nothing, but it's very unlikely that a beginner will even get to a real meditation in that time.

Sure, if you are an experienced meditator you'll be able to switch to a settled state in a few breaths. But that skill is built on years of doing long sessions. For the vast majority of beginning and intermediate practitioners, the first 10-20 minutes is for settling/untangling.

Trying to sit longer should be a priority for all beginners and intermediate meditators.</div>

I like alot of what they are doing, however the gauge will be the balance between mistakes and cost effectiveness. Right now 55% as the highest benchmark isn't good enough, but I think in 2026.. if it starts hitting 70/75% for junior roles... you'll see alot of people displaced.</div>

My lifts are pretty solid, cardio isn't terrible, but double unders? I swear to god these things haunt me. Like I can string together maybe 10-15 on a good day but the second they show up in a WOD my brain just shuts down. 

I've watched all the videos, practiced before class, tried different ropes, but I think at this point its more in my head than anything else. The worst part is watching brand n...</div>

I know it sounds silly, there are many exercises that are much harder/technical, but that's it for me. I've always been very uncoordinated in sports with a ball, and the fact that this one's weighted doesn't make it any different. 

I suck at them, I get hit on the nose 1/3 times and I often go either too high or too low and miss the target.

I don't think it's ever going to click for me. Sigh.</div>

thought AI would save me. everyone says AI is revolutionizing code review right? spent a month testing copilot, claude, and verdent. spent $400-500/month on subscriptions.

result? saved 30 mins per day. thats it.

let me break down why this is a terrible ROI.

tested three tools:

copilot - finds unused variables and basic stuff. surface level.

claude - better at understanding...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">tech lead here. this is painfully accurate

the "AI approved a PR that solved the wrong problem" story hit home. had almost the exact same thing happen last month. dev built a perfect solution to a problem we didnt have. AI said it looked great

the confidence problem you mentioned is huge. AI flags "potential null pointer" with the same urgency as "this will cause data corruption in production". you still have to use your brain for every single suggestion

where i disagree: i think 30 mins/day is actually pretty good? thats 2.5 hours a week. over a year thats like 120 hours saved. not revolutionary but not nothing

what worked for us: stopped using AI for actual code review. now we use it as a pre-review linter. devs run their code through AI, fix the obvious stuff, THEN submit for human review. cuts down on the "you forgot to handle the error case" back and forth

also set a rule: if AI flags something, dev has to understand WHY before fixing it. stops the lazy "just do what AI says" behavior

the junior dev training benefit is real though. our newest dev improved way faster because AI catches stuff immediately instead of waiting for PR review

tldr: AI code review is oversold but if you use it as a teaching tool + fancy linter its worth keeping</div>

right now im running AI review in parallel with my review. your workflow of devs running it BEFORE submitting is smarter. catches obvious stuff earlier

the rule about understanding WHY before fixing is solid. gonna steal that

youre probably right about 30 mins/day. 120 hours/year sounds better. maybe im just frustrated because i expected more based on the hype

how do you enforce the pre-review step? team culture or PR template? and which tool did you settle on?</div>

Which makes it odd that they want Trump to run in 2028, it’ll be hard to claim a strong economy when the country is so obviously reeling. They really will need to rely on the whole “the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears” thing they’ve been trying lately.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’ve owned almost every one of it’s competitors, including the QV.
It’s the best feeling performance car of the bunch. Interior is basic, back up camera quality is shit, and only has wired CarPlay, but the driving dynamics can’t be beat. If you’re really looking for a drivers car, go this way. If it’s a daily and you want all the tech and interior, this isn’t the car for you. 
But it’s the perfect blend of late 2010s lightness before everything turned into 4k+ lbs, and still being modern enough to have standard CarPlay and back up camera even if it’s not the highest resolution on the market.
It’s essentially a better f80 m3 but doesn’t benefit from the aftermarket support that the m3 has.

I ultimately sold mine, bought everything else, and then sold them all and came back to this car, but I do have a daily driver. I’ll be keeping this one forever.

If they refresh it, they just need to use the screen/software already in the Alfa Romeo tonale, give it a better backup camera, and more interior options. The rest really isn’t that important.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is such a great driving and beautiful sports sedan, but the maintenance definitely isn’t for the uninitiated. For example, an [accessory belt replacement](https://youtu.be/JNpGeXjpvnw?si=OlJwle5WbMg-XxIU) is an involved process than requires the removal of items like; the AC condenser, radiator, the intercoolers, and disconnecting most cooling hoses, basically working on the entire front end. Alfa recommends replacing the accessory belt every 36000 miles if you drive in a non-dusty environment, so you’re probably going to want to live near an Alfa dealer or have a good euro car specialist around. Still though, it’s a gorgeous vehicle and there’s nothing else quite like it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, reliability may be comparable to other euro sport sedans if you keep up with the maintenance, but the servicing can certainly be costly. This is where I think the regular Giulia makes its case. The Giulia was designed from the top spec down, so the basic model has the same excellent chassis and handling dynamics. The 2.0T is easier and less expensive to service, and is still pretty quick with 280 HP, but you do miss out on the sound of the V6 which might be a deal breaker. 

Still, Clarkson [reviewed](https://archive.ph/4hEvs) the 2.0T and had this to say, “What is relevant is that I do genuinely believe you could buy a Competizione and convince your friends that you didn’t actually want the V6, that you preferred the nimbleness of the smaller-engined car and that money had nothing to do with it.”.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Competitors like the M3 are going to have similar maintenance costs. To be honest, I've been surprised by how much more affordable my QV has been than I was expecting. After 30k miles, I've spent a grand total of $750 on maintenance (excluding tires) and my quote for the belt replacement was $1700. I spent more than that on maintenance for my Golf R. I do agree that having an Alfa dealership nearby is necessary though, I wouldn't trust any other shop with my QV, even the specialized places.</div>

"The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative content. Yet it's unclear if these models can generate high quality literary text while emulating authors' styles.

Is it just people’s anti-AI biases kicking in? That we need to perceive it’s being written by a human before even considering whether it’s good?</div>

Once you're not able to tell though, I suspect that hate will disappear. Right now I think it's more of a group / mob mentality more than anything else.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, it's short enough the lack of intentionality doesn't show through from the AI, and that the subtler use of language that MFAs seem to love can't really take off either.


It also seems to be heavily guided (ie: the AI doesn't have to do high-level thinking) and in the style of a specific author (ie: the human writer is forbidden from writing in their own unique human voice). If I were designing a test to "show" humans on par with AI, I'd design this test.


They also seem to have a delusion that MFAs are somehow all elite authors. That generally isn't the case. People who want to teach writing get an MFA, but most writers don't otherwise unless they're a nepobaby. There are some excellent MFA writers, but also a lot of terrible ones.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You can make it write novel length outputs. Most authors don't have worldly experience on what they write about. Like magic and dragons. Ai has worldly knowledge on nearly everything, but no experience. Human authors have little experience and little knowledge on most topics.

Ai doesn't do anything on its own. A human drives it like any tool. Giving it worldly experience by proxy. 

Intellectual value of fiction writing is a nebulous concept. Fiction is really for entertainment. Most fiction targets an 8th-10th grade reading level. There's little intellectual value there, and Ai can absolutely capture it.

Human made literature is still better, for now. The anti Ai sentiment will continue to grow and support human writers. No one wants to read Ai output for entertainment, no matter how good it really is. Ai output for intellectual reasons is a different story. Ai can create intellectual output at a post PhD level on basically any topic. It's value there is immense. Go ask gpt to teach you knot theory and you'll understand.</div>

First author of the paper here. In its current form its impossible to get AI to write a full 80000 word book autonomously. AI cant even write 1000-2000 words at stretch without human intervention. That said you can totally see a human can chunk high quality 450 word exercepts to produce something long form. We are doing that experiment next.</div>

But we should all know that AI can't yet scale that up to book length, which is what people buy. I'm not saying they won't be able to eventually orthat it doesn't indicate important skills developing, just that the skill in itself is not that disruptive. It's what you'd want in an assistant and not an author, which makes sense given what chatbots were designed to do.</div>

I can work with AI to create a book that is exactly what I want to read (I have it prompt me for directions at decision points), and I do it regularly.  It’s extraordinarily engaging.  I seriously doubt anyone else would enjoy reading what my AI creates besides me, but that’s the point.  It is produced specifically to what I want.  As everyone learns to do that, it will cut into the sales of typical books.

I still read normal human produced books, but the bar is higher.  I won’t put up with trashy books anymore, because I can make trashy stories I enjoy more.</div>
