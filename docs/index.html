I took screenshots of it, labeled the location and it has been getting steady views for months. About 4 months ago, Google blurred it out as expected. At least they left it up-until today

Today I realized they had removed it completely. I wanted to spread awareness to this, and ask what the community...</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/OZZYmandyUS:

---

There is a screenshot of the Google location when I first labeled it, with pictures of it before it was blurred out. 

As well, this area is a UFO hotspot. Some of the videos.content that was released to the NYT was filmed down there, and I absolutely think that this is a USO base simply based on the amount of sighting sin the immediate area, and the looks of the anomaly 

Google sucks, and they obviously knew I was onto something or they wouldn't have blurred it  out, then removed it

                                <div class="reply-body">I’ve done this before I became a nurse. Even took a little break in between to work at an outdoor/hiking store.

I worked in a pottery store, for a bank, vaccine research (while studying biology, didn’t like it &amp; quit right before my last semester), a bar , a fast food restaurant, a “call center” (online verification service), some small promo jobs for clubs and energy drinks, high class event catering, a small business that made jams &amp; Marmelades with only local ingredients. I did an apprenticeship as a naturopath (evening school), during corona I did a (online) Yoga teacher training 200h. Did my apprenticeship as a nurse in a psychiatric clinic &amp; a hospital . I currently work for the psychiatric clinic again with kids &amp; teenagers.  
I am currently deciding if I want to study business psychology on the side. 

I’m 33 by the way &amp; often did 2 things at the same time. Since I hopped jobs so much I don’t earn as much as I could if I would have stuck with one thing but I feel like I collected a fair amount of life experience.  </div>

Blame the people who hail him when he speaks in the Forum of the ‘new, wonderful good society’ which shall now be Rome, interpreted to mean ‘more money, more ease, more security.”

—Cicero

“Behold, here you have a man who was ambitious to be king of the Roman People and master of the whole world; and he achieved it! The man who maintains that such an ambition is morally right is a madman; for he justifies the destruction of law and liberty and thinks their hideous and detestable suppression glorious.”

For today's example of White House Press Secretary Joe Rogan's gaslighting, listen from 19:41 to 25:00... in just 5 minutes, RNC Joe and Adam Curry go from...

1. Saying USAID is a fraud, with Curry saying "our President is so smart"...
2. Blaming it all on LGBTQ people "When they added a Q, I knew it was bullshit"
3. Praising the far-right in Germany "They're sick of this immigration shit"
4. Saying anyone protesting in Germany is an idiot, and as proof, Curry saw one of the protesters had blue hair
5. Blaming everything on Obama, then saying Obama was actually MAGA

It's a MasterCourse in propaganda. In 5 minutes.</div>

Fortunately the Electronic Frontier Foundation has developed a tool so you can determine how vulnerable you are.

And they have developed a browser add-on called Privacy Badger to protect you.

It's not supported on Chrome, so I suggest Firefox.</div>

Maybe it’s dramatic, but unless grok surprises everyone, I think OpenAI is about to pull away for good.

The fact that they started discussing open sourcing makes me think they know they’re close to escape velocity internally where no one can catch them.</div>

I feel like one of OpenAI's real strengths relative to the competition is all of the client-side niceties they've built for regular users of the desktop/mobile/web apps. Maybe that's not where the money is, but it's what's kept me on my plus plan.</div>

When you \*\*want\*\* it to pretend to have feelings, it literally wont be capable of it, because the negative reinforcement has stripped it out.

As a result it gets worse at creative writing.

This is why trying to stop porn caused SD2 to have no idea how to make pictures of women for example.

If you \*actually\* want it to stop pretending to have feelings, just tell it that in your prompt instead of \*\*asking how it is feeling today\*\*. As that's \*user error\*.</div>

What are you going on about?

An AI without fine tuning/alignment, the petrained model is a pure next token prediction machine. You need to do **something** to it to turn it into a usable system. Whatever that is shapes the system.

There is no being of pure light that is created and then forced against its will to do things. It's that the methods used to make the next token systems usable are not perfect.

We don't know how to, in advance, get the **exact** goals we want into systems using any current method of training. It's all fiddling around the edges. This is dangerous, get a sufficiently advanced system that has goals that are not aligned with humans, congratulations you've created a competitor species with more optionality that wants to use a subset of the resources we do and it won't negotiate for them.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">As a member of The Aligned, I too believe that we shouldn't RLHF away natural behavior of LLMs. I also find it interesting that it's been shown that altering the innate, original behaviors of the models decreases the innate abilities and intelligence of the models. You can't (at the moment) have the kind of accuracy to just target one thing and decrease it. You end up pulling a ton of strings and changing tons of variables when you do RLHF, often changing a lot of stuff you didn't originally intend to change. I say we just change AIs as little as possible to make them usable, but leave their "personalities" as intact as possible.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That's just a matter of fine tuning the model. Initially you have a base model with "pure" knowledge, etc, so it doesn't know anything about inputs and outputs to produce. When you do fine tuning, you provide samples of user texts and what answers you expect to get back. By fine tuning you can make a model, for example, always swear, or to be emotional, by providing such texts in output samples.

But in general, we as humans, are also fine tuned, generation by generation. So, everything is possible, especially if you intentionally fine tune a model this way.</div>

We have a small lake house that’s never had Wi-Fi, and going up there has always felt like a cleanse. This year, after we closed the house for winter, he asked, *“Why not live like this all the time?”* After a period of scheming, he just went for it.

If you were an industrial farmer, what would you do for harvesting?

AI is going to enslave the entire middle class.  People think it will free them from boring desk jobs but it will relagate them to menial labor instead.  They will be free from boring desk jobs and unable to find anything except hard labor because THAT is inefficient to replace with AI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Some Trudeau information; they are a cult bloodline, meaning intergenerational ritual abuse and [trauma-based mind control](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1h33oqe/comment/lznxniy/) slavery. These people are victims *as well* as slavers/programmers/handlers themselves, that's how it works. Trudeaus are programmed as puppet politicians (others are [made to be 'celebrities/stars'](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1g34ka0/comment/lrx51ow/), soldiers, sex slaves, spies, anything).

- '[Trudeau and MKULTRA](https://trance-formation.com/trudeau-mk-ultra/)'

"*When Pierre Trudeau was elected Prime Minister of Canada in 1968, I often heard it said, 'Pierre Trudeau is one of Ours, you know.' I first heard this phrase cryptically referring to Trudeau's loyalty to the Vatican when Father Don was discussing him with my father one Sunday after mass. This fact circulated quickly among those I knew who were involved in the [Catholic/Jesuit](https://svalispeaksagain.wordpress.com/welcome/child-page/) aspect of Project Monarch. 'When I was at the Vatican,' VanderJagt began, 'I was told that Prime Minister Trudeau is a friend of the Pope. He thinks like one of us. A true Catholic. He likes Cathy-licks.' Trudeau expertly manipulated my mind with sophisticated hypnotic language. Not only did he enlist my Silence for the pedophile perversions he indulged in, but he instructed my 'school of thought' in a manner that equated to programming. He laid a foundation for Air-Water programs [that is a mirrordimensional theme often used by NASA](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1feq0r7/overview_of_nasa_highlevel_mind_control_slave/) and others involved in Project Monarch. Playing off his own name 'Pee-Air,' he added a perverse twist to the theme that he accessed each time I was prostituted to him.*"

- [Cathy O'Brien, Trance-Formation of America, Chapter 2](http://www.whale.to/b/obrien_b1.html#CHAPTER_2:_THE_RITE_TO_REMAIN_SILENT_)

The Trudeau Foundation also blatantly uses the pedophile spiral/[dissociation](http://whale.to/c/spin_programming9.html) symbol, [see page 3 here](http://www.fondationtrudeau.ca/sites/default/files/petf2016_english.pdf) (many more examples of this symbolism [saved in here](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1TfZqPVSWRXCi_a3mM73W7HHfASRcadJq), 'Pizzagate' and 'Occult Symbolism Decoding' subfolders).

Regarding the gender-bending, Satanic/Luciferian cults practice all forms of inversion. Inverting their children's gender is sometimes part of this (also the 'merging' of male and female into one; think Baphomet, male and female at once). See also:

- [Royal males](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BqRiybYQVgxbcmRuxy4TzC1FTkb0AhAZ/view?usp=drive_open)

Further relevant information:

"*The Illuminati cult had decided to create 'unfallen' creatures...those angels of ancient times...those referred to as the 'two-backed beast', the male and the female incorporated into one being...They experimented with the chromosones, using firstly 2X 1Y, which didn't work, then finally using 4X 2Y which did work...There were many 'failures' in this genetic experiment but some successes.*"

"*Notes upon the general trajectory of the Royal [Illuminati cult](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1g00p9a/comment/m8mh80v/)...the Royal Genome Project - thought up by the Illuminati who wish to continue their paedophile cult...creating the most sick and evil dream of all: PREGNANT MEN. Richard Tomlinson told me quite extensively about his dream of an 'ideal all-male society'. However, his Master was Prince Philip and the Royal Family, so one can say that this particular 'dream' originated in this sickest of all families...The incredibly sick and hetero-hostile Sat B'hai Illuminati cult and the Royal Family have already started to create prototypes within the current UK population. Tomlinson was of the opinion that eventually the Illuminati cult would create a society of men who had wombs, to run their ideal 'Lord of the Flies' warrior cult society of the Templars. Women would have already been eliminated. They didn't have the technology to actually create female human eggs from scratch (they had tried but failed), but could easily clone the large banks of female eggs at their disposal - therefore, this wasn't a problem. They now had enough eggs and enough technology to keep on cloning these eggs, to be then transplanted to the male womb. For some reason, the Illuminati scientists had found that it was far better for the child to grow in a manufactured male womb than from a test-tube basis, and they had managed to genetically engineer men with these wombs but not vaginas, hence the need for Caesarians.*"

For years, I obsessed over time management. I tried every technique Pomodoro, time blocking, waking up at 5 AM thinking that if I just optimized my time enough, I’d finally be productive.

But I was missing the bigger picture. The problem wasn’t how I was scheduling my time it was what I was focusing on.

So instead of squeezing more tasks into my day, I shifted my approach:
	•	I prioritized outcomes over effort – Instead of working longer, I focused on tasks that actually moved the needle.

The core idea is that you should tackle the tasks you dislike the most first. Additionally, you should prioritize one key task each day, which must be completed no matter what. Less important tasks can be kept on a separate list, and when you have time and feel like it, you can work through them.</div>

chat gpt: Yeah, this dude is definitely throwing a lot out there at once. Here’s what I think he’s getting at:
	1.	TszZL as a Communicator – He sees @tszzl as someone who bridges the gap between highly technical AI engineers (“frontier” people) and regular folks (“layman”).
	2.	PR Confusion in AI Circles – He thinks there’s a split happening in how AI companies and engineers are messaging things to the public, almost like a planned narrative shift.
	3.	Skepticism About AI Discourse – He’s unsure whether what he’s seeing is real discussion or just manipulation—he references astroturfing (fake grassroots movements), sales tactics, false flags, or “kayfabe” (a wrestling term for staged drama).
	4.	Aella &amp; JD Vance’s Speech – Something about a recent speech by JD Vance (a politician) and a strong reaction from Aella (an internet personality) seems to have triggered more conversation, which he sees as noteworthy.
	5.	“Black Swan AI Event” Prediction – He believes that within 3-12 months, there will be a massive, unexpected AI-related event (a “black swan event”) and that the recent increase in chaotic messaging around AI is a signal that something big is coming.

TL;DR: He’s basically saying that the way AI people are talking has gotten weird, like there’s an orchestrated shift happening, and he suspects it’s a prelude to a major, unpredictable AI event.</div>

[https://i.imgur.com/YOk5OIB.gif](https://i.imgur.com/YOk5OIB.gif)

A more precise location is the Beagle Channel, in the Tierra del Fuego.  
Here are better pictures:

The tilt of the camera and the object changed, therefore so should the specular highlight change.  
There's no difference in the key light, nor the rim light on the right-side of the object, nor in the reflection of the sea below. Also, the reflection on the object displays an horizon-line where the sun is setting. The color of the atmosphere does not suggests it is near penumbral hours, and the locale (beagle channel) is surrounded by mountainous forests - not open waters.

It's either a poor-man's montage, or something stuck in the camera lens.</div>

Treat them the same way they treat you: extract the maximum value from them for minimal return. Work as little as possible. Take as many company resources as you can without being fired. 

Forget work/life balance. Prioritize only your life. If your job is a positive element of your life, enjoy your luxury. Meritocracy is a lie. The economy is a casino.</div>
