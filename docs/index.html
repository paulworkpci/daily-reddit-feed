Alright, listen up. You’re sitting here scrolling through nonsense, wasting time, while people out there are grinding, improving, and leaving you in the dust. You think you’re special? You think the world’s going to wait for you to get your act together? Newsflash: it won’t. Every second you spend procrastinating is another second someone else is using to get ahead. And guess what? They’re not smarter than you—they’re just working harder. 

You’re lazy. Admit it. You’d rather binge-watch garbage or doomscroll than put in the effort to actually achieve something. And for what? So you can look back in a year, five years, ten years, and wonder why everyone else is thriving while you’re stuck in the same pathetic rut? You think you’re going to magically wake up one day and be successful? Wake up. That’s not how this works. Success is earned, and right now, you’re not earning a damn thing.

Look around you. People are out there pulling all-nighters, sacrificing their free time, and pushing themselves to the limit. Meanwhile, you’re here making excuses, telling yourself “I’ll start tomorrow.” Spoiler: tomorrow never comes. You’re not just failing yourself; you’re letting down everyone who ever believed in you. And for what? Because studying is “hard”? Because you’d rather take the easy way out? Pathetic.

You want to know the truth? You’re not going to make it if you keep this up. The world doesn’t care about your potential. It doesn’t care about how “smart” you think you are. It only cares about results. And right now, your results are a big, fat zero. While you’re sitting here feeling sorry for yourself, someone else is out there putting in the work, and they’re going to take everything you ever wanted because they actually tried.

So, what’s it going to be? Are you going to keep being a lazy, self-pitying waste of potential, or are you going to get off your ass and prove you’re capable of more than this? The choice is yours, but remember: every second you waste is another step closer to being left behind. Get. To. Work.</div>

Edit: Ok, now how about those Five year old, 250% import tariffs by Canada, on US milk, cheese, and butter?

Edit: Tariffs function like subsidies and price supports, in a lot of ways. IMHO, one of the US most damaging policies has been the price supports around US sugar production. Bad for everyone except producers and politicians.

Edit: AskReddit insists on posts that will stimulate discussion. I'm happy.

Edit: if US produced dairy is as unhealthy as many have asserted, why does Canada allow it to be imported at all?</div>

Also…as an American I’m sad, furious, and ashamed. Canada has been the best neighbor we could’ve asked for. The threats to sovereignty are sickening. I hope the U.S., and all the other nations currently on a path to authoritarianism, can turn the tide. 

I’m speaking up and taking action to oppose this mess, but it does feel like spitting in the ocean right now.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/Maniak-Of_Copy:

---

So Ross says that he has been talking to legacy program defectors and they say that the reverse engineered UAP technology is mind bogling and can end the era of fossile fuel, end wars, unify humanity and open doors for consciousness understanding. This is joigning what Greer is saying, and what Ben Rich pointed to but he said that getting those techs out would require an act of god. Eric Davis said that there is no ARVs but there is some advances in programmable quantum materials. The Ecosystemic Podcast with an official from DOE seemed to point to the same direction of getting those technologies out to the public domain.

I own an electronics recycler myself and we will accept any non-damaged lithium ion battery at no charge. Damaged batteries do have a cost though because they need to be handled in a very special way (involves a 55 gallon steel drum and vermiculite) to prevent fire.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Cool idea. 

You could:

Get stuff out from the library.

Ask people/strangers for directions/ restaurant  recommendations even though it's on 'Google'. 

Go the to Gym and just listen to music or nothing at all... No constantly checking the phone. 

Write more with pen and paper..... Goals, lists, journals. 

Watch all 8 episodes of MTVs 'Spy Groove'. 

Walk confidently  with you eyes ahead, gently aware of your surroundings. Be thankful and curious. 

Realize that smartphone addiction had made people dumb, polarized, reactive, and not thinking  for themselves... 

So if someone  hijacks you with ' Don Tr***' did something..or such and such a thing on the news. Calmly reply 'Oh wow, I haven't  heard about that...So how are you doing? What's going on in you life?  How's your guitar practice? How was your last vacation?

Cont...

Basically you want to hang out  and spend time with other people without cellphones playing a big role. So...

Play basketball  with some strangers.

Join a drop in volleyball  league.

Play old school Nintendo with friends ( together in the same room).

Go hiking with a group.

Walk around a new neighborhood  or mall .

Go bowling:)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Let me add one thing that made the 2000s college experience special - those student common rooms were actually alive back then. While everyone else is in their dorms scrolling on their phones, try hanging out in the common spaces. You'll be surprised how many people appreciate someone who's actually present and looking to chat.

And here's a forgotten art: when you see someone with a book you know or wearing a band t-shirt you recognize, just start a conversation! Without phones as a social crutch, these random chats were how we made some of our best friends. Something as simple as "Hey, is that Taking Back Sunday? Have you heard their new album?" could lead to hours of conversation.

You're going to have such a richer college experience by being more present. Good luck with your 2000s journey!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Boy or girl? Hoodies were always popular, as were jeans and a T-shirt. Honestly, I have some clothes from 20 years ago that I can still wear in public, and you'd never know it.

Scrap the CD player, they're 90's era, use an iPod Nano instead. If you don't have white, wired, earbuds, you're doing it wrong.

If you want a period phone, either a Razr flip phone or a Nokia 3310 or similar. The Nokia 2780 Flip is a good, modern, choice.

Also, the 2000's were definitely not no-surf. The difference was using the internet was an activity like biking or watching TV, where you would do it, and then do something else. The trick is to not be "always connected".

Also, you'll need a Facebook. It's pretty hip around 2006. Make sure to friend [Tom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Anderson) too.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">So we can conclude that this specific routing service is generating more tokens per week. Two problems with the conclusion in your title:

1. More tokens generated does not necessarily mean more usage in the traditional sense. A reasoning model may generate 10k tokens where a normal model only generated a small fraction of that. Thus, the same amount of prompts/users may still generate a larger amount of tokens. This ties in with potential increases in the verbosity of the models.

2. An increase in popularity for one routing service does not mean much for the overall field. Perhaps it takes away from other LLM providers. The usage goes up here, goes down there and ends up staying the same in general.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I am fortunate enough to work for a medical institution that does Continuing medical education seminars and I help the drs with their presentations and connections etc. 

The last CME I did was called “The Psychedelic Medicine review” and it was all about legitimate medical research and treatments for various medical problems. 

They had a whole section on Psilocybin and they had some promising data and legit research to quote about its effectiveness and efficacy rates coupled with practical and safe ways of administration. 

They did speak very briefly about micro dosing and while they spoke very highly of using psilocybin in controlled environments and correct conditions, they did say that micro dosing wasn’t a promising treatment and with the data they had, would not suggest it for treatment, especially for those that are using it without proper medical oversight. 

I don’t want to rain on your parade and tell you that it’s bad, but the data didn’t look very promising. They said that psilocybin was an excellent method when combined with proper therapy and consultation while using it. The whole point of using it was that it opens you up to be willing to accept new perspectives that a patient may not be open to hearing under normal circumstances. 

I’m certainly not a psychologist and don’t take my word for it but I think it’s worth doing more research into the subject to ensure that you’re not doing damage or harming yourself using a method that isn’t as proven and doesn’t has robust data to boot. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve grown mushrooms and have tripped my share of balls, but also, these doctors were incredibly insightful. They are on the forefront of this research and are also kinda outcasts compared to their counterparts and colleagues so I’d definitely consider what they have to say about the positive/negative effects of micro dosing and also, heed caution. 

They also had sections on Ketamine, which isn’t technically a psychedelic unless you take a very very large amount, which then acts similar to a psychedelic. 

They also spoke about LSD and ayahuasca treatments for major depression disorders and other addictions like alcohol, cocaine and other addictive abuse disorders. Super informative to say the least. 

Also funny to note; I was getting major loud whiffs of weed and I was worried I forgot to take something out of my bag. No. It was one of the doctors that was presenting. She stuck like the best flower this side of the Mississippi lol.

The current 5000 series of Nvidea cards use the same process as the 4000 series and the gains between the two are fairly conservative.

I could imagine that we need more focus in the nano manufacturing scale, which could be done first using virtual environments to find the best path towards manufacturing more advanced chips, much like how today we use virtual environments for training robots for real physical spaces?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">What’s really crazy about the algorithms we use is that we mostly don’t know what’s happening inside. Here they used a Torque Clustering algorithm, an optimised version of Unsupervised Learning. 
I used UL with binary classification 1 year ago in college to accurately determine if [asteroids](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/asteroid-classification-for-hazardous-prediction) around earths orbit were hazardous or not. I kid you not, writing the report took me more time than making a model that was performing with 90% accuracy. 

It basically found patterns between the different attributes of the asteroids to determine if it would hit or not.

This new method is doing this in a way bigger scale and it’s not just determining an answer, it can learn and connect *everything* that you feed to it without intervention.

This actually makes me really excited and weirdly scared as well. This feels like a natural path forward towards AGI. 

I’d too welcome more knowledgeable people to explain us how Troque Clustering will make my fridge revolt against humanity</div>

Also there is EXTREMELY promising research about Alzheimers and gut microbiome - there are already case studies of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) reversing cognitive decline in Alzheimers. But progress is slow because such things can't be patented.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">"Biotech/Longevity"

Biotech and longevity research are closely linked to the concept of the Singularity because they both aim to extend human lifespan and enhance human capabilities. The Singularity is often associated with the point where technological advancements, particularly in AI and biotechnology, surpass human intelligence and radically transform society.

In the context of biotech, research focuses on slowing or reversing aging, curing diseases, and enhancing physical or cognitive abilities. The idea is that with advanced biotech, humans could potentially live much longer, healthier lives. This could play a role in the Singularity by enabling individuals to live long enough to witness or even participate in the technological advancements that could lead to it, such as mind uploading, AI-driven healthcare, or cybernetic enhancements.

Longevity research, in particular, aligns with the Singularity vision by proposing ways to "outlive" the time needed for transformative technological progress. It’s part of a broader vision where biotech innovations not only prevent aging and extend life but may also enable humans to merge with technology, a key aspect of some Singularity theories.</div>

Jackie remained in the suit from 12:30 p.m. CT, when JFK was shot, until the next morning, including during the swearing-in of President Johnson.

As Lady Bird recalled in her diary, she offered to get someone to help Jackie change, but the first lady refused.

 *“And then, with almost an element of fierceness — if a person that gentle, that dignified, can be said to have such a quality — she said…*

**‘I want them to see what they have done to Jack…’”**</div>

So to me it’s already stressful enough. When I google advices of how to make mornings less miserable, it’s mostly stuff like “take a cold shower, go outside to see some daylight, workout, put your alarm clock further”.

I would wake up really annoyed because there's a light shining in my face. There's no option to snooze the light so my half-asleep self would then just turn the alarm off completely causing me to oversleep. I've since accepted I'm just never gonna be a morning person and I now let myself snooze and scroll untill I'm actually awake enough to make better decisions and get up.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Tbf, that kind of depends on how early your mornings are.

When my son was in pre-school, I was already waking up at 5. Shifting to 4:30 would mean going to bed at 8:30 if I wanted 8 hours of sleep. Even with putting him to sleep at 7:30, that would mean only an hour to decompress and relax at the end of the day.</div>
