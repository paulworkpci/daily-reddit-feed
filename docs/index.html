The following submission statement was provided by /u/PositiveSong2293:

I don't know what to think about all this. I think everything is happening very fast, and many extraordinary claims are being made without extraordinary evidence. Although we are facing a complex phenomenon and have little to no concrete idea about its origin and purpose, I believe certain claims may lead the general public to see the reality of the phenomenon as something possibly not serious.

I think we should focus more on empirical evidence to present to the general public rather than on extraordinary claims. In any case, the information is valid and deserves analysis.

Edit - I had to go 13 comments down to find anyone not being cynical, mocking, and dismissive e.g. hostile skepticism. Skepticism is meant to be dispassionate. </div>

I'm sure most folks here are familiar with "Bullshit Jobs" - if you haven't read it, you're missing out on understanding a fundamental aspect of the modern economy. 

Most people's work consists of navigating some vaguely bureaucratic, political nonsense.

But, in reality, that change I already here imo, I am a person have increased my productivity around 50x in the last 90 days, while there are some people who don't even know what AI does. 

The distribution of the curve is just widening so far as we speak, where the folks who are and have access to AI are just going to leap so far in next year or two, there won't be a way to bridge the gap. 

I feel some sense of discomfort and pain knowing that there are people who will be affected by this through no action of their own. 
But I read somewhere a whole back, "No action is worse than wrong action" atleast the wrong action teaches you something. 

But yea, just my mini thought dump.</div>

Someone asked me about ChatGPT yesterday so I showed them an utterly trivial task - I needed to reply to a boring letter from the local Council, so I took a photo of it, gave ChatGPT a couple of details and asked it to reply. They thought that was incredible.

The current tech is only starting to filter through - a handful of friends use it for work. If it gets much better over the next *few years* - as in the *seemingly* extraordinary forecasts made by certain OpenAI/DeepMind/Anthropic people - well, that’s not on anyone’s radar.

Lots of people like that think that they're invincible and they have low empathy for others who couldn't do what they did. Being screwed over by something outside their control could lead to a better society eventually. Speaking as someone who suddenly became disabled, society has treated me like utter dirt for something that I didn't ask to happen. So if they realize how broken things are, it hopefully will lead to change for everyone.

Of course it would be best if society sees the writing on the wall and enacts change *before* the mass suffering, but it seems like history never works out that way</div>

This will become next level propaganda.

The AI builds a psychological profiles in real time in what seems like friendly discussion. It gathers the required info to understand your world view, applies natural cognitive flaws to create a strategy to achieve the desired goal. Then it has infinite patients to nudge you along, carefully planting all the info into your brain. Then click, it all comes together and you have adopted whatever belief or behavior the AI wanted you to have.

Classic Public Relations and Propaganda are already pretty effective, throw AI into the mix and we'll be heading to 1984 in no time.

Never trust corporate AI, use it as a tool and nothing more.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don't do IT but I do physical security, all of my years and law enforcement and security I am consistently shocked by how many people have access to things that they should have no business accessing including people having access to security offices, or IT areas. 

Just because you're married to the CEO doesn't mean you should have access to the IT room or the security center. Similarly I've seen CEOs insist that they need absolute access to all IT systems even though the guy is not a tech guy at all. Barely knows what a PDF file is. Then something happens like his computer gets a virus on it or his password gets leaked and the company is in serious trouble since an unauthorized user was able to access things with the CEOs credentials. 

My current job is the only place that is super strict about that, Even the CEO does not have access to the security office and that's very intentional so if you were to steal his badge assuming you would have unlimited access you would quickly find out you do not. Their is simply no scenario where he would legitimately need access and couldn't be escorted by security.</div>

As AI grows more capable, it becomes unethical not to use it in a growing number of scenarios.


I've said it before and I'll say it again, we *will* give up full control to AI. We won't have a choice. The more effective result will win out in the end.


I expect we will fight. And I expect we will lose. Not once, but over and over. At all levels. No exceptions.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">AI already gives me way better medical advice than most doctors. I remember one time I had an undiagnosed bacteria and couldn't eat ANYTHING without suffering. My doctor told me "take care of yourself, don't eat chocolate or pizza and come back in two weeks"...

I couldn't even eat rice and this dude's only advice was "don't eat chocolate" like I was some dumb 5 yo (and I'm quite slim so his comment was just dumb). After weeks of feeling like shit I got some tests done and they found nothing. "It's all in your head, it's psychological".

I asked ChatGPT about my symptoms and the thing got it right instantly. Went to see another doctor, told him my concerns, he agreed with the machine, got treatment and now I'm cured.

Had the first doctor used AI, it would have saved me several months of pain.</div>

So without first class data, the results will not be that great, at no fault of the AI itself. Also I’m coming at things from an SME perspective (as you seem to be), and I just don’t trust any sort of estimates except extremely general gut checks. For small businesses, no one really knows what revenues will be. I guess gas stations might be more standard though because it’s not really SME.

                        <div class="comment-body">While I agree that it's impressive, I have to disagree about the 'solid and high-quality work' claim, at least based on my experience using it in areas where I have decent knowledge. Yes, it's competent, but you'll still get better results by doing your own online research.

The AI gets things mostly right but not completely accurate - it misses important details here and there. However, I believe it will become significantly more impactful in the next 1-2 iterations/improvements. What I find most valuable is its ability to quickly compile information and provide a solid starting point for research on topics I'm curious about.

As of now, I'd rate it 6/10. While it's certainly useful, I wouldn't call it life-changing. Think of it as a helpful first step in research, rather than a complete replacement for thorough investigation.</div>

Look at the link OP provided, they provided A LOT of detail of what they wanted. 

You may just need to write more.

I think it also depends on what you use it for. Like someone pointed out, it can’t fully access science articles. So it will be bad at all of that. But if what you are asking for is freely available and accessible on the internet then it will be better.</div>

LLM predict next word.
Music gen predict next audio token
Video gen predict next video frame


What happens when you tokenize actions? I think that's what happening here.


You give robot the prompt "load the dish washer" and it just keeps predicting the next most likely action until the task is completed.

                        <div class="comment-body">I think you hit the nail on the head here. Groupthink is so pervasive online. People often don’t even realize their “thoughts and opinions” aren’t truly their own. People also tend to base their identity around it all which I don’t remember being as much of a thing before social media.

People these days seem hesitant to “stand out” with their thinking. There’s a desire for belonging to something and when they are deep into internet culture, agreeing with others can fill that void.</div>

You're so right about the groupthink. Whenever I try to join online communities it's the elephant in the room. Everyone behaves the same and uses the same language. It drives me a bit crazy! 


Fun [sad] fact: groupthink caused by specific media is actually called a 'media silo'! </div>

I open Google News in the morning and sometimes again at lunch time if I have time. I read one or two articles on the topics there that seem the most important or interesting.

In the evening sometimes I talk about the day's news with my husband, who has different politics and sources than me. It can be interesting to hear a different take, including on what is important.

It is important to remember that the world will keep turning, even if you don't read about it. The news cycle used to be the morning newspaper and a nightly TV broadcast.

If you are open to some internet culture and swearing, the Philip DeFranco show on YouTube is a fun summary of near daily news. I watch it occasionally.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes we do slaughter animals by the billions, but we are doing things to prevent it, examples being: the development of lab grown meat and factories, as well as animal rights activism.

The only thing slowing down animal rights progress and lab grown meat adoption is tradition.

I suspect it will be the same for AI's, while some people will create AI sanctuaries for them to express their suffering. Other's will simply dismiss their suffering because "they dont have souls" or that "they are non-biological."</div>

Ss: that thing was super fast and appeared out of nowhere it changed directions before I started filming. It's was super bright when It moved and not so bright when it was still. I don't know how many character that was so I am adding a few more for the bots. But that was absolutely incredible. Still shocked to be honest. But yeah I guess they are real. Showed to a few people but they didn't believe me that it is in fact a ufo. But damn no plane moves this fast it was also super far away like a star. What an experience!

                                <div class="reply-body">1. It is very hard to gauge distance against a blank infinite background like the sky, literally anything star sized will look like it's as far away as a star. 

2. From the video this light source appears very close, only a few hundred feet up, but again, impossible to tell 

3. It being closer than you think means it will appear to be moving faster than it is

4. This is moving no faster than a regular mundane human piloted quadcopter drone should. 

Therefore, I do not think this light is anything out of the ordinary. 

Thank you OP for a video clear enough to make determinations like this.</div>

I have my ideal vision of the end of the year written out alongside what I do not want to happen, and I feed that to ChatGPT or Claude AI (I used Claude). Also, I am using their pro models so keep that in mind.

I then ask it to create motivational messages for me based on my visions and designed to light a fire under me. You can tweak the style by asking it to take on different personalities such as Davi...</div>

I have done the same thing by creating a david goggins persona using claude. Along with giving it my vision, I also give it my daily task and habits list(completed and non completed ones). If I am lacking on my daily tasks, then the AI also urges me sternly based upon the completion percentage.  
  
I have also integrated this with telegram and run a cron job every hour, so that the AI can send the motivation message automatically on my phone and start a conversation with me.  
  
I am using a custom script for creating the personas.

This has become my accountability partner for day to day activities.

Obviously, most of the IT industry runs on open source stuff.


IP for any research should be open source imo, prevents so much reinventing the wheel, which causes wasting resources and paywalling people out.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">All the previous video models were novelties.  You kinda just have to take what it gives you.  So there was no way that they would be useful in a real production environment where you need very *specific* performances, not some random thing.  Now that you can use a video to guide the AI generation you can actually make art directed videos.  With this you can actually replace actors, set designers ect without sacrificing directability.

This model and the ones to follow is where the entertainment industry and VFX jobs will seriously be affected.

More than 2 years they promised they will deliver source code they still gave NOTHING! I was there waiting since day one. We don't trust ByteDance and their lies of promises to release source code anymore. What a load of bs

i shared a video with my friend a week ago, it was the Throw it back, which impressed me so much, i watched it probably 20 times. so i shared it, i hardly ever do this, i just wanted him to share this moment with me, he’s a musician btw. 

he replied nothing, after a week he sends his work youtube channel saying ‘subscribe’, and after a few more days - a qr code for me to scan so he could login into my PlayStation. 

i decided i’m not wasting any more time on this ‘friendship’.</div>

If I send a friend a silly kitty meme that lit up my heart, I'm passing the love her way. You might not appreciate it, but please don't take is as an insult or them being lazy. That person is taking a moment out of their day to share something that made them smile. It's a kindness, not an insult.</div>

We RL'ed humanoid robots to Cristiano Ronaldo, LeBron James, and Kobe Byrant! These are neural nets running on real hardware at our GEAR lab. Most robot demos you see online speed videos up. We actually *slow them down* so you can enjoy the fluid motions.

I'm excited to announce "ASAP", a "real2sim2real" model that masters extremely smooth and dynamic motions for humanoid whole body control.

We pretrain the robot in simulation firs...</div>
