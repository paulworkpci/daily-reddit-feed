                                <div class="reply-body">I don't think people realize how much better it is *already*.  I've been watching frieren, which has a fantastic story, but even this top teir masterpiece is like 90% still frames with 1 moving part. Mouth moves a bit, then one head turns, then one hand is raised.  The above is already significantly better.  I expect the volume of high animation and action in anime to just explode in the next year or two.  It's a perfect use case; anime studios are already very cheap and lean on animation costs.  You will see studios with artistic director and core artists that set key frames and design big moments, and let AI fill in the gaps. 

edit: Apparently i need to clarify the obvious.  FRIEREN ACTION SCENES HAVE AMAZING ANIMATION.  I WOULDN"T CHANGE THIS. 

But EVERY Anime uses cheap still-frame shots during conversations, where just the mouth moves a bit and the camera pans.  Actually pay attention during the downtime of an episode and you'll realize how still everything is.

we've just become accustumed to this as standard anime experience, and
this is fine for storytelling, but AI could make it much more alive.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, I've noticed that too. I think CG, in general, has really taken a step back, mostly because major movie studios approach it like a crutch. They don't seem to make much effort into giving it real polish anymore. They just want something flashy and quick. And it definitely shows.</div>

Think of all the people throughout history that were denied being able to create for whatever reason.  
AI is an existential threat to artists because it democratizes art and makes the artist less special.  
Lots of artists think because they have dedicated their life to practice and sacrificed other opportunities in pursuit of getting better, that they are better people that have important things to say about the human condition.

AI cutting out the practice and dedication kills a good part of the mystique of being an artist.

AI making available all the tools needed to be a great artist to anyone kills the old school artists' sense of superiority over the general population.  

It has gotten to the point that anyone using the word 'slop' just conjures up the image of some pretentious art school reject yearning for the days when artists were allowed to gatekeep the public's opinion as what counted as art.

Who gives a shit if Billy makes a 10 season show.  If it is good, others will watch.  If Billy is the only person that likes it - the AI has done its job.</div>

If their wealth would be grain, meat or cattle - like in ancient times - they would be poor very quickly, because the wealth would rot if it's not shared.

You know, you don't necessarily need to share it with anybody. But they should be forced to at least share the company shares with the employees. That would boost the economy, spending, opinion plurality etc. so so much.

We don't need billionaires. 999 million is enough for anyone.</div>

That’s exactly what alignment means to them. They want to ‘align’ it to Bourgeois interests. They don’t want the technology being used for revolution, they want the status quo.

That’s why Open Source scares these fuckers, we have zero reason to trust corporations with all the power over the people.</div>

Immediately I was faced with hostility and rude responses from users. Not gonna lie, of all my time on Reddit, this is the closest I am to never use this site again. It's a bad experience using this site, it's toxic and unfulfilling.

I asked chatpgt for steps to leave Reddit and it recommended this sub. 
So here I am, do you have any advice?</div>

Hey everyone,

I had an unexpected orb experience while flying into Helsinki, Finland yesterday, and wanted to share it here with all the evidence I’ve gathered. I even asked a pilot and he’s stumped. 

The Encounter

As the plane was descending into Helsinki Airport right before sunset, I noticed a bright, stationary white orb in the sky. It wasn’t moving at all even though our plane and the buildings below were clearly in motion. It ...</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/VeenaViera:

---

Key Details:
• Location: Helsinki Airport airspace

• Time: Just before sunset

• Appearance: Bright white to amber light orb

• Behavior: Completely stationary, reappeared in the same spot, then vanished

• Distance: Very close—within a mile or two; seen clearly in front of buildings
• No blinking lights, no motion, no sound

What It’s Likely Not:
• Not a plane (no blinking lights, no motion)

• Not a star or planet (it was close and in front of buildings)

• Not a reflection (clearly visible to the naked eye, not just in-camera)

                                <div class="reply-body">Hi can you help explain something that’s confusing me.

So OP claims the flight was AY7026 which flight radar claims is plane OH-LZR FIN75D.

But in your picture shows OH-LZI FIN5KH which flight radar claims is scheduled for the AY7024 route.

They seem to take very similar routes and only 20 mins apart but differ when approaching the airfield. AY7026 has no depart/arrival time on flight radar is that because it was delayed?

Was the flight number, plane, and call sign all changed when the flight was delayed? How can I identify the correct plane and flight in the future?</div>

People seem rather quick to forget the camera isn't stationary in the video, it's on a plane cruising along at significant ground speed... but then so would another plane traveling in roughly the same direction.

And yeah, add "near sunset" and if they were looking east it could easily be an aircraft reflecting the sunlight, which would wash out any navigation strobes.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This diagram is just someone's interpretation of how various groups—secret societies, institutions, organized religions, and global organizations—fit together in a structured way to suggest there's a hierarchy controlling the world. While some of these entities do hold influence, I think the diagram oversimplifies things and creates the illusion of a rigid structure when, in reality, power is far more fragmented and complex.

Nobody truly knows the full extent of how these groups interact, and while some of them may collaborate or influence each other, many operate independently with competing interests. The idea that there's a single, highly organized system running everything is more of a theory than a proven reality. Power shifts constantly, and even those in positions of authority often struggle to maintain control.</div>

The abrahamic religions such as Judaism, Christianity,  and Islam, were influenced by Zoroastrianism, the oldest monotheistic religion.

The zoroastrians would make Sacrifices to Tishtrya/ Tishtar, the storm and fertility god that represents Sirius.

The canaanites would make Sacrifices to Ba'al, the storm god of fertility.

The zoroastrians came first, not the canaanites.</div>

Early 2000's nostalgia (when I was a teen) brings me back. It reminds me of when everyone was so mysterious. I personally thought the best of people.

                        <div class="comment-body">“I don't see anyone ever laughing in public.“ I found this to be such an interesting comment. I used to laugh all the time and something has shifted; I’m not sure if it was the pandemic or the increasingly hostile political climate or social media or what, but I’ve changed. I now *notice* when I laugh really hard, because it happens so infrequently. I’m not unhappy and I still have fun with my friends and family, but it’s…different. And now that you mention it, I don’t see anyone laughing or goofing around in public anymore either. 

I think a lot of the lack of liveliness in society you describe, from clothing to general light behind the eyes, is definitely down to social media. Our phones are sucking our souls. Everyone is trying to look the same, everyone is trying to be nonchalant and chill about everything. We lose hours and entire days to our screens. People aren’t as unique and colorful and fun anymore. Many celebrities are less mysterious because they air all their drama online. It’s all quite sad to think about.</div>

Yes everyone is so sombre. I do believe COVID had something to do with it, like if you laughed out loud it was like giggling at a funeral. Same vibe. Like "how can you laugh when people are dying??" Even though you're at a grocery store. Kind of fucked when you think about it. 


But social media too. It has just sucked the life out of everyone. The mystery, the wonder, the uniqueness of people. Because everything has been picked apart and dissected to death. People have been shamed for no good reason at all. 


People are less interested in falling in love and getting married because of all the horror stories they have read online. Same goes for kids. What woman would want to give birth after reading a million stories about how hard labour was? No one wants to try anything because they are scared. They have no hope. And fear lurks at every corner on the internet. Everything you do is wrong. Everything is unhealthy, or bad, or psychologically damaging (apparently). But the worse habit of all is the one we all share that is never not ok, and that is this f*cking internet social media bullshit that is ruining everything and everyone. 


Adding to this, you also mentioned being nonchalant. I get that. I am also like that now. When I interact with others, I don't really get attached to anyone and I remove myself at the first sign of drama. Like if I see it coming, I disappear. It's convenient, but disfunctional. We are meant to have all of the in person interactions, good and bad. </div>

People always outside at parks, at church, exercising in nature, eating out, at bars, and just walking around. So many beautiful people, many hand in hand. Yes many phone zombies but it's just so different as an outside society.</div>

I'm in Canada and we are related. People with real culture don't act like this. That's why Indians here aren't like the rest of us. 


But to your point about the parks, I was thinking about this today. You can't even go to the parks around here. They are all taken over by drug addicts. It sucks. Like why would you go there? </div>

We as humans have a natural need to share who we are with others ie to feel accepted by some type of group. Sharing who we is the only way we can find out who others are and determine if we want them in our life and at what level of we do.</div>

I came across a post where a woman was asking "men" whether they would prefer a wife who worked or was a SAHM as a way to make a decision on what to do with her life with her husband. Like... What?? Men, random men. Any man, from any walk of life. Men who's story she would never know. She wanted to know what THEY thought. That's so weird!! That's so freaking disfunctional! I can understand maybe asking a general question about skincare or how to clean a floor or something, but something so personal and life-changing, why ask random strangers what their opinion is when they have no idea who they are? This is just an example. </div>

These superintelligences are *orders of magnitude* better than us humans at considering the big picture, and considering current events I'd say we've thoroughly proven that we don't deserve to hold the reins of power any longer. 

In other words, they sure as hell couldn't do *worse* than us at governing this world. Even if we end up as "pets" that'd be a damned sight better than complete (and entirely preventable) self-destruction.</div>

More on Chris Mellon - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher\_Mellon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Mellon)

Most likely referring to the 1953 UFO incident in Kingman, AZ: [https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-contributor/2016/11/15/did-ufo-crash-kingman-1953/93828300/](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-contributor/2016/11/15/did-ufo-crash-kingman-1953/93828300/)

&gt;***Researcher Preston Dennett, author of "UFOs Over Arizona"*** *(*[Did an AMA here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1gy2sg9/im_preston_dennett_ufo_researcher_author_ready/) a few months ago)

&gt;***“The object was described as metallic, 30 feet wide and three and a half feet high, oval-shaped with portholes,” he says. “Inside were two to four, four-foot tall humanoids, deceased according to most sources, with large eyes and wearing metallic suits.”***

&gt;***The object was quickly scooped up and taken to either Area 51 air base in Nevada or Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, Dennett says.***

&gt;***Among the scientists assisting in the recovery was engineer Arthur Stancil, Dennett writes. After making measurements and studying the crash site, Stancil concluded that the craft struck the ground at 1,200 miles per hour, but was strangely undamaged and definitely not human-made.***

&gt;***“The object was not built by anything, obviously, that we know about on Earth,” Stancil says. “It was more like a tear-drop-shaped cigar ... like a streamlined cigar.”***

There were six between 1947 and 1959 - Syminton, Finletter, Talbott, Quarles, Douglas Jr., and Sharp.

You can find the list here: https://www.afhistory.af.mil/History/Secretaries-of-the-Air-Force

Also according to my Googling abilities, SES-2 lately refers to a satellite, but https://www.afcent.af.mil/News/Article/501050/who-or-what-is-an-ses it is the Senior Executive Service, who it says are government-hired civilians with pay grades equal to those in U.S. Military ranks.</div>

Three weeks in, and it’s wild how much less overwhelming it feels. Tiny progress &gt; perfect progress. Anyone else use this method for big projects? Alternatives that worked for you?  </div>

He said something along the lines “Nobody can do 100% every single day and unless you’re in dire circumstances, if you commit to a small percentage every day it’s easier to stick with it”. 

I like that, while basically the same thing, I like the framing of the 20% as it feels less nebulous than non-zero to me, and the specificity of the number helped me figure out what my own 20% means</div>

Step Two - Redorder them in order of importance.

Step Three - Do them.

There is no hack.
No software will truly help you.
No trick method will instantly fix you.

It's hard work. 
So take a deep breath.
Sit down.
Do it.</div>
