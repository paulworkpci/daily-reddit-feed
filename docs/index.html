Luckily, most of my elderly relatives don't use the internet much, if at all. They're not into Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc, etc.

I put Youtube on their TVs. It has so much free media after all. They can listen to music, watch TV, get news, whatever they want. It was good at first, but over the past months I've noticed *is...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">My parents live with me and are both boomers. Once my dad had a stroke at age 65, he was very much homebound. He started to watch YouTube religiously. Thankfully he didn’t fall into the politics trap but was definitely annoyed (even then) how they pushed it. 

In 2021 my parents got YouTube tv so they could watch “cable” shows again. Which worked great for them until my mom was watching MSNBC 24/7 and I could feel the terror and dread feeling in the house. I begged her to cut back to just highlights of news each day but she was very much addicted. 

Then my dad died. 

With that grief, she suddenly couldn’t also handle the onslaught of cable and internet news doom and gloom that they push to keep views. Since his death, she’s managed to completely cut out news and just gets her daily updates from npr radio in the morning. 

Seeing how she has mobility issues, watching tv is a decent pass time for older people, but it’s so much harder to navigate these days.</div>

Look at the damage ‘impartiality’ does on the news. Science is unequivocal about things like vaccines, but in the name of ‘impartiality’ they bring on a vaccine denier.

That’s not what being impartial means. Being impartial means observing fact and empirical evidence without bias, and if you do that without bias, these guys are _always_ in the wrong.

Even their new stupid Executive Order about ‘returning to two genders.’ There are five million intersex Americans. Not trans, not LGBT, intersex. Biologically equipped with both genitalia. I believe I read that 1 in 600 men is born with some form of female reproductive organs.

They’re just flat out wrong, and you’re not forgoing impartiality by saying it. They deliberately paint it that way to normalise their absurdity.</div>

Trump is ransacking institutions with no oversight; mass firing government employees which has already started chaos to government services; threatened to annex Canada, Greenland, Panama, Gaza; lectured European allies about democracy (the hypocrisy!); threatening to tariff (and implemented some) allies including America's largest trading partner which is sure to jack up inflation; inflation continues to rise negating a promise for him to bring prices down on first day of presidency; belittles Zelensky (who is a god-damn hero) as a dictator; cozy's up to Russia for "economic opportunities;" leaves Ukraine and allies out of peace talks; threatens permanent occupation of Gaza as a "real-estate venture;" threatens to not comply judicial branch of government alluding to imminent constitutional crisis; intimidating government officials/employees who do not fall in line; blames air tragedy on DEI without grounds... and I'm sure there is plenty more I'm missing!

Holy shit MAGA cult, get your head out of your asses. Your country is burning before your eyes. The two billionaires in the white house don't give a fuck about you.</div>

This is a neurotic reactionaries take. 

Everyone’s stugggling. 

Everyone’s been struggling without things getttinf better under any kind of leadership. 

You can’t explore nuance or context with that wall of text. And social media is a horrible place to flesh things out… 

Nothing will change. No one is coming to deliver us. 

But Ill always my roll my eyes at neurotic reactionaries that say our world is burning before our eyes when to me it’s been that way for quite some time already.</div>

Anyone who disagrees is either simply dumb enough to have been convinced against the obvious or willingly supporting their behavior because there is an actual asshole where their soul should be. It's not as though the dudes have been hiding it, they just butt-fuck you and call it anal care to your willing and grateful face.

Stop rolling over like a pig in slop just for the sake of supporting your "team". Government is not a sport, but you can bet your sweet little orange dick tickler that someone is playing. I wish you "conservative" fucks out there would either stop being bitches and demand a respectable party be put before you or just admit that you wanted this shit show and accept accountability for everything it entails.</div>

Even on this sub, the lovely MAGA folk are being more open about how this is all about revenge and punishment. They feel they've been under attack by having to be nice to people that don't look like them and now it's time to punish the rest of society for it. Burning America to the ground is a small price to pay for being told that even people who aren't straight and white are still people.

Or as my friend's dad so eloquently put it, "party's over n*****s, back to the zoo!" It was never about inflation, the economy, or the constitution. It was about that.</div>

We're skeptics and atheists because we follow the facts. If the fact is psionics are real, then I'll gladly accept it. Just prove it. Prove anything, please. I'm open to all possibilities, but you gotta provide more than "trust me, bro". Yeah, that's enough for true believers. However, not all of us choose to believe whatever makes us feel good.</div>

The thing is, there’s no proof. There’s no repeatability. There’s no experiment that can be done which actually demonstrates that any of this is real. And there never has been.  It’s not that such an experiment is impossible to construct, it’s just that the people making money by pushing the woo know it wouldn’t show any results.


It’s no different than the “healing power of crystals” - A bunch of babble that can never demonstrate any actual results.  No different than human sacrifice to bring back the sun, or rain dances, or building a fake landing strip in the hopes that more cargo will show up. It’s superstition.


And where this will end, is with another UFO cult committing mass suicide to try and join a comet.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Toe was elevated too high by people licking his ass to get on his podcast. He lucked out big time with launching his podcast right at the beginning of podcasts becoming a major industry. He fell ass backwards into what is arguably the most coveted platform in the world for people looking for media exposure. Smarter, wealthier people than joe noticed this, and began filling his head with the ideas they wanted to be proliferated. 

So he's basically getting brownnosed from everyone below him on the totem pole and having his buttons pushed by the people above him. It's the perfect recipe for a dangerously moronic mouthpiece</div>

When you get absurdly rich and forgot where you came from it means you were always a piece of shit and we just needed time for you to prove it.

and it he wants to stop paying taxes he can incorporate Joe Rogan into a publicly traded company with  stock and not pay any taxes like billionaires do.   Not that it is gonna work out for him at the present time,</div>

crazy - only one part of the prompt has mirror in it  
  
Prompt example - "A medium close-up shot of a young woman with long, wavy blonde hair, sitting in a softly lit bedroom, speaking directly to the camera while applying makeup. She holds a pastel-colored eyeshadow palette in one hand and dabs highlighter onto her cheek with the other. The camera remains static, focusing on her expressive eyes, which are adorned with shimmering pink eyeshadow, as she smiles and explains her makeup routine with enthusiasm. The background is softly blurred, showing a neatly made bed, **a mirror reflecting warm light, and an open wardrobe with hanging clothes**. Natural sunlight streams in from a window, creating a soft glow on her face. The shallow depth of field keeps attention on her, while gentle bokeh adds an aesthetic touch. Her voice is warm and engaging, guiding the audience through each step of her beauty routine."

The bigger your prompt the better. Natural language vs keywords.

You know what I do? When something I say or think is incorrect beyond a certain point, I just cop to it on some level and adjust. That's painful in the moment but in the long run you end up with a worldview that's easier to reconcile with actual facts.

I'm starting this Monday. It's pretty simple, but it will be hard.

The Triple30 Program: 

* Don't snooze *(even on sundays)*
* 10.000 steps *(at least)*
* 60 min. workout *(4x a week)*
* Stick to diet *(no cheatmeals)*
* Track progress *(daily picture)*

Miss a day? Go back all the way!

90 days, every day, to transform your life completely. Who's with me?

                                <div class="reply-body">My dad and I accidentally watched this movie in the wrong order. We put the second dvd in first and honestly I feel it works better that way!!! You start with romantic tension and the training montage and the middle climax is the death of that one guy. Then you get a flashback to the friendship and romance which is more impactful knowing one of them dies. And the whole time you know this big event happens somewhere in the movie but unsure when so it’s kind of hanging over the plot ominously. Then you end with the big explosions and pageantry of the bombing of Pearl Harbor</div>

He knew nothing about it, was just coming because everyone was going, and it was hyped up.

Movie finished with Frodo and Sam looking at Mt. Doom, he says "That's how it ends?! That's stupid." We inform him that it's a trilogy. And he says "I have to watch 2 more of these fucking things now?!"</div>

Also a good pair of in ear monitors aksi works &amp; you can listen to your media without needing to crank it up to 11.</div>

But every day, I watch Trump and his cronies systematically dismantle the Constitution and democracy in real time, hiding it behind the excuse of “DEI” hires while stacking positions with loyalists. He’s trying to take full control of the military, likely to impose martial law and silence, detain, or even eliminate those who oppose him.

                        <div class="comment-body">No situation is truly hopeless. To someone living through WW1 it might have felt like the world was coming to an end. To someone living through WW2 it would’ve felt even more despairing with the mass destruction and casualties that occurred. During the cold war, many people thought they would simply wake up someday to a mushroom cloud on the horizon and that would be it. Through some of the most horrific and brutal periods of human history, through destruction and bloodshed, we have continued to march. I have no intention to ever stop marching. I will always have a burning sense of hope inside myself, and i will always try to look on the bright side of life even through pain. The world, despite its problems and painful aspects, has continued to steadily get better throughout time. The bigger picture is something we can sometimes lose track of.

Never lose hope. Life always has a way of throwing curveballs. I wish you a calm and pleasant day/noon/night.&lt;3</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I hear you, and I know how easy it is to fall into that loop where every day feels like a copy-paste of the last. The good thing is, you’re aware of it, which means you can start changing things little by little. You don’t need a massive overhaul overnight, just small shifts that create momentum.
Try waking up even an hour earlier than usual, just to break the cycle and give yourself a bit more structure. Getting outside for even ten minutes a day can make a difference too, just to get some fresh air and reset your mind. If you’re feeling stuck, picking one small productive thing to do each day, whether it’s making your bed, showing up for one class, or reading something useful,can help rebuild a sense of progress.
I’d also recommend setting a cutoff time for gaming at night so you have space to do something different before bed, like journaling or planning the next day. And most importantly, talk to someone about how you’re feeling. A lot of people go through this, and just opening up can make a huge difference.
I talk about these kinds of struggles a lot on my channel, and it’s not about forcing yourself into a crazy hustle mindset, it’s about making life feel a little more meaningful and less repetitive. Even the smallest steps forward count. You got this.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Imagine paying 50 cents per second, only to be told at the end that Google has censored it for some inexplicable reason. That is often the experience with Imagen 3, but at least that is free on ImageFx. Also, don't expect to ever get any features you need for making little movies, like Subject Reference. Even if the price of Veo 2 comes down, it will remain highly censored and feature poor.</div>

Been using it for a decade and never had it bounce a text. In the last few days I had them refuse to send a text telling me they violated terms of use.  One text was telling my wife I would get gas on the way home. Another replying to a doctor's office verifying that I would go to an appointment, and another asking if we should get a cortisone cream for a rash my son has.

first off, I'm inordinately grateful for this sub. Even though it's ironic to use a social media to motivate getting off it, I have found  kinship and camaraderie here. I have struggled for years with smartphone addiction. 8+ hours a day of use, the legitimate destruction of my focus, the erosion of activities I used to hold dear - reading, playing music, thinking, staring at the ceiling.

She sought exception from a big tech company she was working for at the time and was asked to complete all the shots or be fired. She quit the job around early 2022.

That was a ridiculous period of government and corporation overreach. Im glad it is over and lets never do that again.</div>

But during this whole tech explosion, I feel like I've heard shockingly little from the nation I would expect to be leading the charge. Is there great progress going on there that I'm just not hearing about in America? Does anyone have information on how things are developing there, and possibly why news from Japanese tech companies is so relative...</div>

One guy said, in Japan, the new generation of leaders at a company often doesn't do anything new because it would be an indirect message to the previous generation that had done something wrong. They don't innovate for fear of insulting their elders. With a mentality like that, how could you ever advance?

Japan has been stuck in the year 2000 since 1980.</div>

Even their video game industry is leaning more on Unreal and other western software. Their fundamental research is still good and they do well in hardware.

I think there's a lot of misinformation and propaganda regarding Japanese culture. If innovation is so frowned upon, why were they the first East Asian culture to truly adopt western science? How did their industries grow so rapidly?</div>

They both love advanced technology - but only in certain sectors. In others, they’re awfully out of date.

Japan is really behind in a lot of technological developments and the idea japan is super advanced is more of a cliché than actual truth nowadays.</div>

China meanwhile has been on the cutting edge when it comes to software, and the current breakthrough with robotics is merging machine learning/AI with current existing robotics, so we are seeing things coming out of China not possible to program manually before like tentacle arms, free dancing doggos with wheels, extremely agile humanlike robots, etc.

China is basically Japan if Japan moved past the year 2000, the only issue is most people who never visited China or Japan have a 20-30 year out of date view of both those countries.</div>
