He does not have legal authority to do a blanket freeze of congressionally approved federal funds or shut down agencies created by Congress, which is why it’s being done so quickly and haphazardly. In the likely event that most of it is rejected by the courts, the damage will already be done.</div>

The faster you find compassion for yourself and your challenges, the better you will do :) trust me, beating yourself up and thinking what you're going through means nothing doesn't serve you as you think; there's no glory in the struggle.

Also, maybe there's something going on physical health wise? What do you eat? When was the last time you went to the doctor? Being really tired could be an indicator of a number of issues.</div>

What kinds of activities or hobbies do you like doing? Try making a schedule or setting aside time to do those things because work can't always make you excited and feel like life is worth living. Maybe try seeing yourself as a character that is part of a bigger story (regardless of how boring it might seem) and set yourself on a mission to do something each day that makes you feel happy (in other words, try seeing your life through a cinematic perspective).</div>

Probably should get into a hobby but it’s hard with all this deep snow 😭🤣 I’m a young guy too so I’m used to hanging out with lots of friends now I just sit at home most the time or the odd time I’ll take the 40 minute drive to the nearest town that has actual shit to do</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">ELI5 here:

You know how models like deepseek r1, o1 and o3 mini "think" before responding to your input? They do so by outputting tokens, it helps them reason through your input, and then they respond. They "think" out loud. By doing so, they are occupying space in the context window, which is limited (the "memory" of the conversation). This new idea lets language models do all their thinking inside their "heads" (in latent space) instead of writing out every step. That means they don’t waste space showing their inner work, so even a small model can be super smart and effective without needing lots of extra room to explain its reasoning. Also, by doing so, they can reason in ways that were not possible by using only words, making them less constrained.</div>

As a side note though... We've been seeing these impressive levels of intelligence in the latest models, and *they're still cognitively handicapped by having to think in plain text language*. So all of their performance has been essentially with one hand tied behind their back in terms of potential reasoning capabilities. How smart would a model like o3 have been if they reasoned in this new way, instead of the old, more constrained one?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">yeah, this is the first step into the scary kind of AI; we are already seeing deceptive behavior policies in the thinking process in visible space of currently 'safe' models.

But right now it doesn't matter because we can see the reasoning (the bits of reasoning we can't see are bounded to latents in 1 time-step), so it's easy to detect and filter in SFT or penalize in RL

Once we move this into latent space, the cost of detecting this goes up dramatically.</div>

My initial negative reaction about the lack of direct subpoena power for the task force may have been off base, this looks to be serious. They are asserting their authority as well as saying things previously unsaid by connecting UAP with ET. This might be a big deal indeed.

They certainly didn't take kindly to the stonewalling. Feds are scared and uncertain with the new regime. Things look like they might go any which way and paradigms will be shifted and upended regardless. They know if they hide shit now but it comes out later on, they'll get put on the gallows. They have to assume Trump and (particularly) Elon will eventually want to go after UFOs and NHI, and they don't know what kind of powers they will have by then when they do. This uncertainty is the perfect weapon for this opponent, short of straight up capturing them and all of their files, and putting hot irons to them.</div>

Only thing I'm not happy about is term "extra terrestrial." That's not what most people are saying anymore, and words matter. The phrase, last I checke, was NHI and for that exact reason, those agencies could tell him the truth, they don't have files on extra terrestrials...

2 big pieces of news revealed in this article:

Friendly Country:

&gt;*So you know there's gonna be disappointment, people complaining, why lead with JFK’s assassination, why not just focus on UAPs?*

&gt;***“We’re doing USOs and UAPs, but we have - so a task force is typically set for six months, and this is the first time that we're actually getting a task force that's gonna be focused in,” Rep. Anna Paulina Luna exclusively tells Ask a Pol.*** ***“And so I'm hoping to set up a congressional delegation (aka, CODEL) to a friendly country that has a program for disclosure that's already been set up - which, to my knowledge, does exist.***

Dave Grusch:

&gt;*Did you guys ever have official follow-up with David Grusch in a classified setting?*

&gt;***“So the last administration and agencies denied his security clearance which is why we couldn’t get back into the SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility), so that's when we followed up and tried to get him an active security clearance for working in the SCIF,” Luna says.*** 

&gt;*And so that's gonna be a top priority for you?* 

&gt;***“Yes, 100%,” Luna says. “But now that we have an actual task force, we can actually do something.”***

I'm not sure why everyone is speculating about some kind of secret program from an unknown country, as France literally has a public UAP disclosure taskforce like this called GEIPAN.

I want something that can perfectly decipher my internal monologue, my intentions, my abstract thoughts, my mental images and sounds, my feelings, and my subconscious.

I want to throw a fireball in a video game not because I thought of a predermined arm movement, but because the AI model felt that I was willing it into existence without even imagining myself moving an inch.

I want to send a text to someone by just saying what I want in my head, not by imagining myself doing the finger movements needed to type the text.

I want lights in my house turning on or off just because the AI model understood what I needed, not by imagining myself doing the movement of flicking a switch.

I’ve also wondered, would AI be able to help you understand someone who’s deaf and never learned to speak properly? And if so, would each deaf person be unique, or is it roughly equivalent across all deaf at birth people?  

Could be an interesting study into how the brain forms without speech and if there are similarities that can be found.</div>

No one with any familiarity with any of these departments he's slashing his way through. They are just picking random things and saying "this sounds like a waste of money, get rid of it."

Which coincidentally is exactly what Musk did when he took over Twitter. Remember him just tweeting out random stuff like "I found a bunch of useless code in our system so I deleted it" and then their entire authentication process stopped working? It's pretty much exactly what he is doing with the entire government right now.</div>

Possibly it views US lives as more protected already or it considers the population densities of India and Pakistan, or potentially more years of saved life per individual in areas where healthcare is substandard and life expectancies are lower. In any case it's interesting, if it is emergent value systems, that it even ranks the value of lives this way.</div>

Now with social media people tend to take the internet more serious because they’re actual people whom you can place a name and face to.</div>

I got the creeps from the platforms like Facebook on day one. It suddenly became this thing where your pressured to share every aspect of your life and all your social connections, ran by a guy who up until recently looked like a reptile.


I also think people started getting off on voyeurism. </div>

If the companies do not comply, they are not allowed to operate in the USA. It's as simple as that.

Notably, o3 reached this level without reliance on competition-specific, hand-crafted strategies.

Key Highlights:

Reinforcement Learning-Driven Performance:

o3 achieved gold exclusively through scaled-up reinforcement learning (RL). This contrasts with its predecessor, o1-ioi, which utilized hand-crafted strategi...</div>

I'd never done any of this before and in total it took me about 4 hours. It blew my mind what AI can help a person do that has a good general grasp of computers.

I'd say at this point don't fixate too much on hard coding. It's way too slow. You'll be moving far too fast in the near future to be bogged down with such granular labor.</div>

Elon prefers the sub-25 crowd because they're easy to manipulate and be forced to work overtime, and it's bonus if they're on a work visa because then they're basically Elon's personal slaves.

This guy seems older and he's American, so he was already on thin ice. This "delete your post" was just them fucking with the guy. He would have been axed anyway.

Can you imagine working for a CEO that does the nazi salute in public?</div>

If you're referring to the "still win" part of the post I think that's a combination of two things: not trying to come off as a petty person considering said hill being died upon and genuinely being emotionally invested in the work you had been doing and the people you were working with.</div>

On my street alone there are 2 houses that have flown Ukrainian flags since the war began. 

We are well aware that Russians are moving into occupied territories, making themselves at home in your land and producing fake referendums to make it seem as though the Ukrainians who couldn’t or wouldn’t leave their homes “want” to become a part of Russia. We are NOT falling for this propaganda!!! Taking away someone’s passport and telling them to vote for Putin at gunpoint is not a fucking referendum.
