                        <div class="comment-body">You live in totalitarian United States of American.


After the annexation of Mexico, Canada and Greenland, the US is locked in wars in the Arctic against Russia and at its southern border against the United federation of Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil. 


President Donald Trump Jr. has assumed the chair of the unitary council of the United States, having officially dissolved Congress and the Judiciary, consolidating power over the government in the office of the White House. After his physical death, President Donald Trump still lives on as a transnational entity of the United States called TrumpOS, reanimated as an oracle platform as a service. 


Countries under the control of the US are mandated to use TrumpOS to administer the infrastructure of the state, primarily as a physically embedded chip in all citizens. TrumpOS dynamically generates personalized media for each citizen and regulates entire populations.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, impulsively I feel like I can always recognize Suno songs, but honestly, with the right promptwork, there could be plenty of AI songs out there that I'm just simply not recognizing, and I just naturally have no idea.

If that's the case though, I still think 90%+ AI music is still recognizable to people who play around with it a lot and can recognize its thumbprint. Just like anyone might recognize a song by a particular artist, because of their signature style. AI music is just still kinda bad at being mediocre, but mediocre in a very very particular kind of way.

But once again, even my guess at the likelihood could be victim to survivorship bias.</div>

Like... what is your point, other than being a shit stirrer? It's not like the two products are easily interchangeable, so what is the point of these constant rants?</div>

Usually I disagree to start nice conversations in which me, someone or maybe everyone might learn something.

Sometimes I do this to expose stupidity or lies. Bashing other people is rarely my goal, if ever, but I definitely love to disagree.</div>

I used a new code editor that ships with Claude for free. It didn't cost me anything to make this which was a good win.

Who else is building with claude? Any body want to form a group together to share prompts and tips?

                        <div class="comment-body">Claude is amazing at coding. I'm a beginner and have basic knowledge of JS. I tried Vibe coding after hearing all the noise about it. Made a Tamagotchi-style virtual pet app with simple Play, Sleep, Clean, and Feed buttons. It was created in React with Redux, and a small bit of Socket.io. Claude gave the full app code in one go. And the most incredible part is that it didn't give any Runtime Error, just some simple game logic tweaks. I think AI is only as good as the user. You will have to give it detailed instructions rather than just simply saying make me this app. However, I strictly avoid copy-pasting AI code when learning, just use it as a Google search alternative.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I knew it would be a low production high priced super car, but holy crap 600K? I was expecting a 200K-300K CAD price tag for it.

I understand that this is one of the best, if not the best track cars right now, but I feel like half the performance can't even be used on the street.

For me personally, I would have an Aston Martin DB12 Coupe with some change to spare. Good balance of performance and luxury.

Then again, people buying the GTD probably aren't cross shopping with an Aston, but then the question comes again, why not a GT3RS? If you want an uber insane track car, the first thing I can think of is the GT3RS. Can anyone tell me exactly how the GTD could justify being more than 2-3x the price of a GT3 in CAD? Availability? Why not a used GT500? I highly doubt most drivers even have the skill to TRULY push this cars to the limits. A GT500 for 95% of competent to skilled drivers will be above their skill ceiling, let alone a 900K CAD GTD. Edit: Also to add literally the C8 Z06 or ZR1.</div>

GTD owners probably already have a GT3RS. 

I know of one redditor with a GTD allocation that also owns multiple road cars including a GT3 touring and several non road legal track cars.</div>

Limited availability. The buyers are hoping flippers and speculators drive the price of this thing upwards like the 911R or 911 S/T.


Many of these things are almost certainly going to end up as garage queens within a larger collection.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I feel like they’re missing the mark with this car. It’s way too expensive for the performance. The 17-22 ford GT originally retailed for under 500k. That car weighs about 3k lbs

The Mustang GTD is reported to weigh 4,300 lbs. yeah it makes like 200hp more than the GT, but that weight difference is insane. Almost 50% heavier 

The GTD at 815hp would be about .19 hp per lb 

The GT is about .215 hp per lb 

That’s not everything, but still

The GT just feels way more special, like a super car. The GTD feels like an admittedly very cool but up-jumped Mustang that is costing far too much for some cool engineering that doesn’t overcome is core issues 

But I guess the millionaires don’t care</div>

Just keep coming back to it, gently, trying to observe what’s happening in your body. It’s difficult to explain really. 

But remember: It doesn’t have to be perfect, and it gets easier with practice.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The title is somewhat misleading. It conjures up visions of little gidgets fixing our bodies. This particular development is still about using the bots as vehicles, not "repairers": 

"Using these biological “tools”, Karolinska researchers managed to tansport a series of molecules, known as “ligands”, inside tumours; these molecules are able to bind to specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells, known as “Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) receptors”. Once activated by the ligands, the TNF receptors (which form part of the so-called “death receptors”) trigger the programmed death (or apoptosis) of the cells."

And what were the nanites themselves like? "Researchers “hid” the instructions for producing the ligands within a nanorobot made up of genetic material “folded” in a specific way and designed to start working only in slightly acidic zones (at pH 6.5), like those of breast cancer cells (whereas the pH of healthy cells is around 7.4). 

In other words, the Karolinska researchers created a type of **biological origami**, i.e. a DNA envelope **containing information for the production of ligands**, but which stays closed until it reaches the cancer cells. These cells create an acidic microenvironment, and it is only under these pH conditions that the origami envelopes open and expose the fragments of genetic material that lead to the creation of ligands (which, in turn, activate the cancer cell receptors, triggering their apoptosis)."</div>

Capabilities require matter: at this scale we're talking about highly specialized tools that are far more specific in purpose than a screwdriver.

They're just simple mechanical machines, like using nonots to cleanse the bloodstream of shed-off TNF receptors. (Possible and safe because that's the ONLY thing they can do.) Certainly there are hypothetical organs that could be created that make and manage such things on their own, but that's really more of a bodyhacking/enhancement kind of thing.

Grey goo would probably require factories. We certainly can paperclip ourselves (it's arguable that we're already doing so with oil), but it won't be terribly exciting from the perspective of an individual human being. (Even if it is extraordinarily rapid when compared to the timescales of civilizations and geology.) Real life is frequently disappointing like that.

Body modification to become a goth booba catgirl might take many different treatments over weeks or months. It still beats the alternative of *not* becoming a goth booba catgirl by orders of infinity, right?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yay 🙌.  First time I’ve seen someone else in this sub mention the astrological transits and how they relate to history and now. 😉

Not to mention the upcoming Uranus in Gemini transit, which also occurred during the American Revolutionary War, the American Civil war and WW2. 

And the current Neptune in Aries transit which also occurred during the American Civil war. 

David Palmer the ‘Leo King’ has some really fascinating videos on YouTube where he and a historian/history professor look at the connections between events in history and astrological transits/aspects and also brings it all to the present as well. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">found out today GPT steals anything you develop in it, upload to it, check for errors with it, ask it advice about, or mention to it, and then spontanously suggests it verbatim to dozens or thousands of other users.

So my guess about its future impact is: it ruins a few thousand lives and careers, creates massive lawsuits, then even WORSE things surface about it, rinse repeat.

and I don't understand why their Gemini 2.5 Pro is still in Beta.

Today I see Cursor has major updates

Should I migrate back to Cursor? Has anyone tried the latest Cursor and see if it's better than Windsurf?</div>
