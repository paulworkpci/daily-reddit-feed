Same thing happened with the 370Z. Then came the redesign. Boom, nearly $10k more expensive.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I can think if a lot of reasons affordable sports cars have disappeared.

1. Greed 

2. Low build quality sports cars are really tolerated anymore as brand new cars.

3. Emissions equipment and testing isn't particularly cheap and is performance cars are categorically going to perform worse on those

4. When even basic cars can be specced at 250-300 horsepower, most people struggle to justify a sports car, especially in the US where it can be exceeding difficult to find places where handling trumps the extra straight line speed.</div>

* have a refresh coming (c8)
* decided to go EV on an enthusiast product, didn't do it well, and are struggling to get ICE out the door (charger)
* price a 5.0 premium + performance pack at near 60k (mustang)
* increase prices across the board (brz, 86, wrx) or are sunsetting the product (supra)
* drop the manual (vw)

its not a good time to be selling pricey, subpar enthusiast cars, seems like the Miata, Z4, Z are enjoying some much deserved success

Mazda is showing here that if you play your cards right, even in this difficult regulatory environment &amp; economy you can have a proper, successful sportscar</div>

BINGO!

Yeah, I'm so sorry I don't want to spend 60K on a daily driver.  Forgive me I don't like the thought of dropping a grand on two new rear tires after some hooning.  

I did a Hellcat redeye driving experience at a local Mecum car auction a couple years ago.  You do (via the passenger seat of course) a quick 0-40, brake hard, 90 degree turn, some more gas, another turn, drift a corner, then drift around a cone, and then come to a stop.  It's over in 30 seconds.  I was giggling like a little kid.  Best fucking marketing campaign ever!  But no, unless I win the lotto or magically triple my income, I can't afford that car, or that driving.</div>

The sound of the shot, is one that has ricocheted and bounched across an open field, BEFORE it hit the microphone of the camera. Or from ANY camera that videoed the final moment.

Not an explosive BOOM, as if it came from right beside all the camera's, hitting the microphone *Before* it had the chance to bounce. You can hear its in the final stages of ringing out and bouncing by the time it hits the first mic.</div>

                <div class="post-content">CrossFit is hard.  I’m sore most of the time but I keep showing up regardless.  Can’t help it.  I’m addicted to the work because of what I’m able to do outside the gym.  I’m 61 and I still work on my own cars.  Up and down the concrete garage floor, laying on the cold driveway is no big deal for me.  No way could I do that if I didn’t do burpees and V-ups every week.

Anyone else addicted to the soreness because of the reward?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There’s a great Andrew Huberman clip talking about a part of the brain called the Anterior midcingulate cortex, where he describes this part of the brain grows when you face challenges and do hard things. Force yourself to do things that are uncomfortable and it grows. And that this part of the brain continues to grow when you do hard things AND it does not bring you joy but you do it anyway.

I had to watch the clip a few times because what he says is so impactful, but he is explaining it to a guest who talks over him a bit and it almost belittles the points he’s making.</div>

Also imagine changing seasonal stations on Google earth. Maybe adding filters like lidar and others energy wave length. I know there's websites for that.

In a hypothetical future where everyone's brain waves are able to be captured locally and transmitted to communicating satellites, then everyone's actions could be mapped to a live model of earth with a 270ms delay. It's also possible that the AI systems could analyze previous brain waves to make predictions with a high enough degree of accuracy to bring that closer to 0ms with seamless error correction.</div>

Just look at Ukraine, the war started and now both sides started using drones. What are those companies doing is much more complicated, because making a hand is much harder than just strapping a gun to a robot.</div>

It's more likely like the teleoperation is recorded, and then it's adapted for the robot. There needs to be a name for it, like teledirecting or teleinstructions.</div>

Can you guess which party had the majority in the United States House of Representatives in those years?  I sure can't.</div>

The author was talking about a different subject but touched on it in a subsection of his post. He says that the singularity will be one of if not the most turbulent events in the history of our species. He said that the fabric of humanity will tear.

Can you shed some insight into what this will actually look like ? Are his predictions of catastrophic change warranted ? I’m v...</div>

Your guess is as good as mine or the authors. Like with every industrial revolution, I think the transition will be ugly, but humanity will come out better eventually.

Just enjoy the ride and stop fixating on materialistic things, because they are worthless/abundant in this new world we're entering.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Personally, I think the Singularity is an extreme scenario, but obviously I wouldn't be here if I haven't thought about what it would look like. Ray Kurzweil says we'll be a million times smarter because the computers would enable it. So what would be a typical smart thing anyone could do? Not solving a quadratic equation or writing a funny poem... Probably a gnarly integral. Ok, doesn't matter, maybe just reading a book on a complex topic. Imagine doing X and doing it a million times faster than normally. Not only you but practically everyone all the time. 

Is it possible? What are the hurdles? Some people say that ASI is a modern substitute for God, and you can't answer any questions about the Singularity with certainty, so we're left with dreams and wishes. My contention is that you can't trust anyone with this kind of power even though I don't believe it's actually achievable. You need some sort of open AI organization of volunteers where the rules of open data, open source, and open weights are set in stone.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It would depend on what you mean by a singularity.  Some people define it as the moment we have AGI, or ASI, or when human minds merge with machines.  Probably we will see AGI, then ASI, then human-machine minds in that order.

So what do we expect for each scenario?

AGI - massive job losses and a need for a new economic system to care for the needs of citizens.  A new wave of privacy concerns as every aspect of your life is now under scrutiny from AI.  Every street camera now reflects on every thing it sees and reports to who knows who.  The government, companies that want to direct ads to you, stalkers?  At the same time systems once unable to keep up with demand will open up and be much more available.  AI Doctors will be common and health care will become much more accessible.  Knowing what is true and what's not true will become harder as AI agents begin to manipulate information online.

ASI - Scientific miracles begin to happen every day for good and for bad.  An ASI can suddenly synthesize viruses that could destroy the world and yet also create cures for cancer, diabetes, dementia, etc. Technology evolves at a pace where things become common place without us even knowing as robots manufacture new tech and lay out infrastructure without the public really knowing what it is they are building.  
  
Human-machine minds - At this point what it means to be human is completely redefined.  There's already a stark difference between a human at 60 IQ vs 100 IQ vs 150 IQ and machine upgrades will be yet another example.  Unaltered humans and machine humans will be alien to each other much like humans think of monkeys.  Altered humans will likely take on completely new agendas with such high IQs and common things like reading, watching movies, dancing, etc. may not hold any interest to them.  Not only this but humans will be biologically immortal which is entirely foreign to the human condition until that point.</div>

                <div class="post-content">So when I was in Grad school they taught us walking meditation. That was many years ago, and it went to the back of my mind.

But yesterday I just thought, why not get my feet on the grass, ground myself, and do some walking meditation?

When I place my right foot down, with slow, careful heel to toe steps, I breathe in, then take a step with my left foot (still breathing in), then place my right foot down again and breathe out.
And you walk in a circle doing this.

It's so simple and so refresh...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">In zen practice, one of the main benefits of walking meditation (kinhin) is to provide a break from sitting meditation, so that meditation can be continued for 10 hours or more a day during silent 7 day Sesshin retreats. The combination of sitting meditation with walking is very powerful, and many satori (sudden enlightenment experiences) occur while doing walking meditation between sittings http://www.frogzen.com/uncategorized/walking-mirror-samadhi

When I first started meditating seriously I was inspired by the Buddha’s legendary vow to not move from his spot under the protective cover of a fig tree until he realized enlightenment. I’d get into the full lotus, grit my teeth, and force myself to remain still, despite increasing discomfort. Eventually I’d remember there was something more important to do — like cleaning the oven.

It was a great relief to finally discover that it was okay to alternate periods of sitting with walking, while still remaining on the same general spot.

Sitting too long without getting up is unhealthy. Alternating sitting and walking allows one to meditate longer. The meditation method being practiced, such as following the breath, can be continued during a period of easy walking.

When practicing walking meditation the hands are usually held against the solar plexus, with the elbows out and forearms parallel to the floor, with eyes lowered.

I like to sit for 25 minutes and walk for 5 minutes, which fits nicely into hourly segments, as well as being easy on the body. Walking in a circle clockwise around the meditation area is traditional, as is back and forth on the same pathway.

Some Theravada Buddhist monks sit for one hour and walk for one hour, for half of each day, year round.

Walking at a normal pace is most popular, although some traditions even walk at a brisk pace. The most meditative method is to walk really slow, with an in-breath upon lifting a foot slightly and an out-breath when placing it half a step forward — which also works well when the space is limited.</div>

I used to have the Claude Max $200/mo plan for Opus 4.1 in Claude Code.  

But lately I’ve been getting excellent performance on GPT5 codex via codex CLI. Better than Opus 4.1 in some ways. 

I have tried Codex via the plus plan, the $20/mo one. So I’ve hit weekly limits. 

But Sonnet 4.5 has just been released albeit I haven’t really given it a spin. 

Any advice? My use case is NextJS dev. </div>

Claude is great. I believe is the best one for coding. But sometimes it just gets dumb. 

Codex is my fallback. When Claude get stuck I jump into codex. 

I prefer Claude for design and coding. But it is good to have a second opinion or fallback for when Claude is down (or you get the 5 hs limit). 

On the other hand hand I have tried several other models and I really liked GLM 4.5 (I haven’t tried 4.6 yet). You can use it inside Claude Code.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">i‘ve been testing sonnet 4.5, gpt5-codex and glm 4.6 plans over the past few days with a nextjs project.  
i think sonnet 4.5 is easily the best of the bunch. glm 4.6 is the worst, it needs a really good plan by a sota model or well broken down tasks, otherwise it codes itself in a corner.  
gpt5 codex is great, sometimes best but i hit the limits much quicker than sonnet 4.5, even after the anthropic rate limit changes a few days ago. that’s on the 20$ plan. i also like claude code much more and the surrounding ecosystem of tools.  
  
if you‘re still unsure, my advice would be to test all of them for a month with your use case.  
but generally sonnet 4.5 with claude code is hard to beat and there you at least have the 100$ option to upgrade to when you hit the 20$ limit.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm on the max $200/month CC plan, been using it a good amount for the last 4 months. Sonnet 4.5 is a big upgrade. I was only using Opus 4.1, but for the last week, I've been using Sonnet 4.5, and I think I prefer it to Opus. It is faster, and generally gets thing right on the first go. I haven't hit any usage limits. I've been thinking of downgrading to the $20/month plan to see if I can get by on that, but the $200 is 20x the usage limit of the $20 plan. I occasionally run multiple CC agents concurrently, and I use it every work day. So I am not sure. I get my $200 worth for sure. Anyway, Sonnet 4.5 is definitely good, and Claude Code is my favorite agent. I tried codex and opencode, but IMO, they weren't really that close.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I find in general that GLM 4.6 is an excellent reasoning model but a poor coding model. The differentiation here being it's just not good at writing code and doing agentic tests. It is when given all the information going to come up with the eventual correct answer, and that's by no means a small feat for an open-source model. 


Claude Sonnet is, as it's always been, the best worker. Its code isn't necessarily the strongest generated code, but it is the strongest worker, extremely task persistent. Codex, and people are conflating here the tool and the model. Codex the tool has addressed the "working" part of the agentic coding frontier, for itself, but isn't  necessarily a stronger model than Sonnet. 

Someone's going to respond here with that whole Codex works for 24 hours or whatever. And yes, I mean that's the tool, not the model.</div>

With anthropic sonnet 4.5 even at the 200 price point you can hit rate limits without automating. That tips the favour towards OpenAI right now.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I have a tip concerning this that may help someone who sees it. What exactly you ask for matters a lot here, don't just say `review the diff`, say something like `use maximum reasoning effort in your role as senior software analyst to audit all changes for actionable defects and API contract violations of any kind and report all that you discover`. `API contract violations` is practically a magical incantation when it comes to using AI to audit code because the concept of what exactly adhering to the contract of an API entails goes much deeper than just the individual function calls that might show up in the diff. It changes your request from validation that you called a few functions correctly to validation that you called the functions correctly AND correctly prepared whatever you passed to them as input AND did what you were supposed to with whatever they returned back to you as a result. I have also yet to see a chain-of-thought model completely fabricate/hallucinate an issue and have it still think it's an issue by the time it determines whether there's an API contract violation there and if it causes an actionable defect or not. It's a great way to find annoying bugs that stem from rare invalid combinations of flags, return values or subsequently triggered events you aren't handling, etc.</div>
