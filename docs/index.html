Do you not see the hypocrisy here?

Look: I get it, a capitalist company needs a healthy balance sheet. But OpenAI’s marketing pretends that it is not. And this is the underlying pattern in Silicon Valley; grandiose visions of a Utopian future but “It was capitalism after all” (Kara Swisher quote)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">100%. I see GPT-5 as a really pragmatic upgrade; significantly less hallucination, more agentic ability at a faster speed, and higher intelligence at a lower cost.

"Cutting costs" is often said with a negative connotation, but as you said, getting more intelligence at a lower cost can never not be a great thing.</div>

1.) Wants access to amazingly powerful and rapidly improving AI models

but also

2.) Hates private corporations and wants them to fail and for the investors involved to lose all their money.

So these people are going to be upset at anything that isn’t “company x provides incredibly expensive service for free and loses tons of money and collapses, but promises to continue free service anyways.”</div>

You can just overlevel your main (usually your starter) by like 10-15 levels and crush anything that stands in your way, even if they have type advantage.</div>

It's cool that us humans like to try to switch things up and add some variety--and hell, maybe there are some more overpowered strategies with certain pokemon if you can find them--but for game-beating purposes this is it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Zuckerberg has shown that he bends way too much with the wind politically and technologically. He jumped on metaverse, jumped on maga,.now is jumping on AI. But his track record is showing that he lacks the follow through, and will jump to the next thing. Unfortunately this political stance is pretty sticky and will be hard to shake, and will alienate a lot of his potential market share. The fact is, trump only has three more years. Whatever political brownie points he thinks he's earning will backfire in the longer term</div>

It happened in my home country in India where since coming to power in 2014 the pro right government followed the same template as USA now. They are still in power and keep encouraging pro right movements while doing nothing to improve conditions of ordinary people. We have terribly giant numbers of unemployed youth now in India who find temporary relief working temporary or gig jobs and many times for the government (social media trolling, bodies for hire during rallies or protests, or creating menace during minority religion’s festivals)</div>

A Dark Horse with a $10k Supercharger kit sold directly from Ford.

*Maybe* $20k worth of performance upgrades (all of which you could buy and install yourself), a tacky body kid and upholstery, and racing stripes for a $70k markup over the donor truck.

                                <div class="reply-body">I had the pleasure of sitting in a regular Super Snake a while back at a local dealer. Whipple, manual transmission, cool carbon fiber aero bits, alcantara seat inserts, etc. Pretty badass ride. But that’s something you could build yourself for $90k. A whipple supercharger kit is about $10k, the aero and suspension bits probably total to around another $10k and the seats are probably about another $2k. 

Get yourself a Dark Horse and all those parts and you’re paying around $85k to $90k. This Super Snake that I sat in was about $160,000. The Multimatic-prepared Dark Horse R starts at $15,000 less than that, and that car has a LOT more work put into it. Shelby American pricing is absolutely mad and Ford should have never stopped making the Shelby Mustangs themselves. Sick cars though</div>

These Shelby products have gotten so lazy lately, everyone has been saying as much on instagram (believe Shelby was banning them for it as well) such a far cry from the ford performance products of last gen (350R, 500). Old man Shelby would've been proud of how much they are milking the name!

I think the wide body on this looks incredibly cheap as well</div>

Haven't extensively tested it,
Don't code with it,

And I already had my model output dry, precise responses so not missing any personality aspects.

There is a lot of outcry atm, so Im not denying that it isn't working out for many.
Just haven't noticed a problem personally.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yep.  It has been better for me as well.  It's super fast for easy questions.  Automatically thinks longer for harder prompts.  I've had less hallucinations so far.  I HATED the sycophantic personality of 4o, so the new Spock talk is great for me.

It's not a huge improvement, that is disappointing, but for how I use it is a big improvement in almost every way.</div>

From what I hear the usa backtracked that Nvidia GPU ban so I'm not sure they really have to go with Huawei, someone must have finally realised giving away the whole chinese market to china is a bad idea.  
But in the long run I think the Deepseek team prefers dealing with Huawei and not deal with the usa's instability.</div>

I had the same issue for a year. I tried diffrent approaches and read several books, but nothing continued working effectively. It works at first, the mind is calmer and insights are arising, but after some days the mind is completely back to chaos. 
I think that a lot of people go thr...</div>

Take it easy on yourself. Enjoy the journey and the discovery. You are not weird because your mind talks a lot and it's hard to control. Everyone is definitely the same. It's just how the brain works, this has an evolutionary explanation. 
The goal is not to shut it off, but to build another kind of relationship with it where it doesn't affect you as the same and where you are connected to your true nature, to consciousness.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The thing about the Google searches could be true.

You generally look up something to learn the background about the situation. You don't need to look up the background multiple times. As the Epstein list situation became a hot topic again, there was probably a spike in people looking up the situation, which would drop off even if people hadn't lost interest in the situation.

But they're likely using the fact that Google searches dropped to signal to their audience, "see, this stuff doesn't matter, everyone's moving on, it all turned out to be nothing. No one cares anymore and you probably shouldn't care either."</div>

They pick a event that occurred in real life and create a lore parallel to this event. For exemple, "a TV show host accused of treating their employees poorly". That's a fact, but then, they create an event, like I said, parallel to it. "A TV show host accused of treating their employees poorly... *because he was under substances while working*"

If you're used to consuming content on the internet, you'd probably tell EASILY that's fake. However, the comments are FLOOOOOODED with older people believing the situation was real.</div>

This also circumvents common heuristics that people use to distinguish fact from fiction or truth from falsehood. If you can independently confirm part of a story as true, you are more likely to believe the rest of it as well. It's building trust with the intention of abusing it later.</div>

Far different experience when it is working in an established codebase. To be fair, the same is true of human devs. I get why comparisons are for greenfield toy apps, but most dev time is spent working with existing code bases.

It would be interesting to use a large opensource codebase as the source for the benchmark (something like gitlab) and test how well these models can implement features or fix bugs.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I took the plunge on Chat GPT Codex CLI a few days ago. The CLI version apparently uses Chat GPT 5, whereas the non CLI version uses o3 still apparently. I haven't used an agent based coding approach before, but I have been really impressed. I develop in Unity 3D and Java. I have a local LAN based git repository (Gitea managed). I installed Codex CLI in an Ubuntu WSL instance and just changed into my Windows source folders which were auto mounted under /mnt/c etc. The source folders were already being version controlled by git. I just ran the codex command and immediately started issuing tasks on my existing code. It just worked. For example, I got it to write the code for a new modal dialog box in Unity following the patterns of existing code and in my eclipse Java project, I got it to update all of the logging for Production. I asked it to create commits with suitable comments and it did. I looked at what it had done using eclipse's git tooling and everything was fine, so pushed to my LAN Gitea repository from there. Very hassle free. This was all with my existing Chat GPT Plus account.</div>

People seem to have their brains broken a little bit when they don't see the typical progress on previously cherished benchmarks.</div>

I have a lot a lot of issues with the 4o parasocial folks, but when the GPT5 model router is routing people to mini models for questions which used to be handled by larger models, or low reasoning effort models when medium used to be the standard, its rightfully frustrating. 

GPT5-thinking-high is great. I would argue GPT o3 was far more capable than the version of GPT5 most people are getting routed to for 80% of requests though</div>

Their "tests" boil down to shit like "come up with new physics", "solve some unsolved mathematics", "write a story", "come up with a new business idea".

It's like those classic "I have an idea for an app" people but the idea has no substance beyond "I want to make money".</div>

\-Very good at long button sequences through menus, the map, battles, or combinations of the three at a single time.

\-Does not suffer major, prolonged hallucinations often. Usually "snaps out of it" upon a few failures.

\-Decent strategy with intelligent insights that even sometimes surprise me. Still goofs up sometimes.

\-Bonus: I find its jokes genuinely funny and clever.

All files that has been "processed" during cut operation, have essentialy been removed from the original location, and undoing the cut implies that you don't want your files to populate target anymore either. So the files are lost. Or rather - invisible to the user, if they were stored on a hard drive you might be able to restore them using special software that looks for deleted but not yet overwritten data.</div>

What I mean is, real confidence comes from grinding. It's the hours you spend learning your craft, the research you put in, the relentless repetition, the hands-on practice, and (crucially) the honest self-assessment afterwards. You build a solid "internal core" until you can confidently say "I'm...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A thought I had is confidence comes in two flavors I almost call it "hot confidence" and "cold confidence."

Hot confidence is the feeling that you're going to definitely succeed and there's no way to fail.  
Cold confidence is you won't necessarily win, but losing is not devastating and you can just walk in and do your thing. 

Usually the latter is more sustainable and likely what you're describing, but everyone loves the hot confidence.</div>

Based on your definitions, I think the opposite - everyone loves cold confidence. Hot confidence will come off arrogant and naive to a lot of people. But someone who just comes in and quietly exudes an air that they have things under control is what most people find appealing</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">People like optimism, but they don't like arrogance.

People like confidence, but they don't like the bravado of windbags.

People like when risks are dealt with, rather than ego brashly attempting to dodge failure as it arrives.

People like reliable expectations, not to have unrealistic hopes dashed upon the rocks.


Set realistic expectations, manage risk, be optimistic and confident that you can meet the challenge, and learn from your mistakes and failures (this means looping them back into expectations and managing risk).</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Agree that you have to put work in. But confidence is built through succeses. You become more confident in something when things go well, but failures also dent your confidence.

How you work around this you set small but realistic goals to build your successes and minimize damage from failures. Let's say you want to play an instrument. A difficult piece would be daunting, but the basic etudes are doable enough for beginners so you're better off working your way up simple pieces.</div>
