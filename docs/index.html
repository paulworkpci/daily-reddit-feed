                                <div class="reply-body">They want us to work in mines, in factories, in fields, and enlist in the military. 

The plan is to increase the birth rate for more workers/consumers, remove competition for "bad jobs" (deportation) to remove anyone who cannot work (disabled people) and force women to churn out babies. 

They want us to be so poor and with so few options we have to live in a company town, shop in a company store, and accept a tiny wage. This would enable them to have more growth than is currently possible.

This could, in theory, work for a decade or two tops (in practice there will be uprisings, but let's pretend) The thing is it wouldn't be sustainable even with a docile population because the income/wealth disparity is already SO bad, and will continue to grow, so no one will have money to buy shiny new products.</div>

Is this just a calm before the storm? Are all the teams just working flat out behind the scenes, waiting to make the next big move? Or are we in a bit of a plateau moment?

Curious what others think.</div>

About half of this sub was convinced that AGI was already here, and there were constant Tweets by Altman being posted about the massive surprise that was just around the corner. Yann LeCun was mocked relentlessly for saying he thought AGI would probably take another 5-10 years.

So it's true that people have unrealistic expectations, but those unrealistic expectation were being pushed hard by this sub.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">We need the same kind of power revolution to coincide with the AI one to keep up. In the long run, if we're talking about scaling AI with the technology we have today in generation (e.g. battery tech, solar, gas turbines, etc.) we'd essentially be blanketing the entire planet with power plants.

Fortunately, the technology around power generation is continuing to develop. Maybe not at the same rate, but solar panel price to efficiency continues to improve, and so has battery tech (think solid state and energy storage) over the past 10-15 years.

Either way, I think it'll still take a lot. My hope is that as AI systems continue to innovate and improve, they are also maintaining a drawdown on power requirements. That seems to be happening as well, where at some point, those things catch up to one another and can also be done using only clean power sources</div>

First, the pricing model change which makes them milk the user as Cursor had the monoply and a good product. The funny part is that the price of $200 only and only gives you access to the base model.

Second, the rate limiting issue. No matter which plan you go for they rate limit your request, which means that Ultra plan that I was paying $200 also has rate limiting for using Opus 4 MAX.

                        <div class="comment-body">Very interesting watching how they have handled this. If I was marketing at Cursor, I would change the pricing model like they did, then find out the most influential people discussing Cursor, remove their limits secretly so they can go on YouTube and say "I have no idea how other people are hitting limits, I've been using it for hours and days without hitting a single limit". 

Looks like they have a PR disaster on their hands from all the bad press and now they have been forced to be more transparent and start refunding people. I don't know if admitting they were wrong and refunding will gain the trust of the community back, but time will tell. I think people will still be quite concerned by the number of genuine posts that were taken down by the Cursor mods on the subreddit and the unclear information from the company to begin with. Cursor and Claude Code still seem to be the top products in the space so its possible they recover.</div>

The really sad thing is `Claude Code` is just `Claude Sonnet 4` or `Claude Opus 4` with a slightly better system prompt. `Cursor` had the full package. The best auto-complete, the best UX, all the best frontier models, they supported the major OSes, and a good price. An example of their good UX is the `Restore checkpoint ` feature that is a game changer.

Yet since January they have  been slowly turning up the heat on everyone like we were frogs in the pot that wouldn't notice. They didn't fix  bugs as much as they should have. They kept changing the UI and UX in silly ways. They introduced `MAX` modes which started out useful, and then they turned the pricing into API prices plus markup. Finally they pulled this "unlimited" BS.

On the other hand I think half the problem is OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are all stabbing them via pricing, and competition. The big mistake they made was not selling the company like `Windsurf`.</div>

If Grok 4 actually got 45% on Humanity’s Last Exam, which is a whopping 24% more than the previous best model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, then that is extremely impressive.

I hope this turns out to be true because it will seriously light a fire under the asses of all the other AI companies which means more releases for us. Wonder if GPT-5 will blow this out of the water, though…</div>

I've seen a lot of boot panicks, black screens or other catastrophic issues along that journey. Any improvement would be very welcome.

Recently I have seen posts and comments about how doctors missed a disease for years, and ChatGPT provided a correct, overlooked diagnosis. Imagine a chat bot on steroids, ending the years-long suffering of a real human. If real, this is philosophically hard to digest. One has to truly think about that. I was.

*Then I realized, all this commotion must be disorientating for everyone.* Can a ChatGPT convo actually be better than a 15 minute doc visit? Is it a good idea to run a Ch...</div>

Chat meanwhile recently diagnosed an injury based on a photo and careful reporting of symptoms the day it happened. It took over a month of me pushing back on guidance that would have led to further damage for doctors to take me seriously enough to diagnose me formally.

So yes: if you can get adequate medical care from an actual human, do so. But multiple studies show that is harder for some of us than others, and Chat can be better than nothing.</div>

I built this because of my frustrations with Context7. Very often, Context7 doesn't have the library that I want or it injects too much unnecessary stuff into my context window.

This extension lets you collect specific content from web pages, ready to save as a Markdown file for feeding into an LLM as context.

It’s crazy to even suggest such extreme excess for most people. Everyone flying a private jet to work will destroy the environment; and there will be insane private jet traffic. 

There are systemic issues with the way things are set up. Sam here can use his money to educate people in this system and introduce changes into the system, but he will not. None of them will. None of them are idealistic altruists; they are greedy and selfish, and that’s all they can ever be. </div>

                <div class="post-content">I have severe OCD and trauma that lead to three years of chronic stress. I'm only 25 now and realized I need to make a change so my heart doesn't suffer in the future

So I started exercising and meditating 

Holy shit

My trauma went silent, as did my OCD. I only meditated for three minutes and I don't hate myself as much as I did. It's just so amazing what it's already done to my mind so early.</div>

I've been vomiting for 15+ years.
I've done every single gastric exam and allergy test there is, and lately got diagnosed with anxiety and the meds actually helped, but it never stopped. 

After prompting it my exams it suggested me to check an otorhinolaryngologist for dizziness.

After a brain scan, It turns out I've been living with a massive labyrinthitis caused by a nerve pinch in my brain. Fully treatable.

I'm starting my treatment this week, hoping for the best.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Wow, I had a really similar experience. After a seizure-like episode sent me to the ER, the first neurologist I saw told me that I was making it all up for attention. Thankfully, the second neurologist actually took me seriously. He did a spinal tap- which no one had thought to do before- and ruled out meningitis.  Turns out I had occipital neuralgia, caused by a pinched nerve in my brain. 

The symptoms were brutal: sudden electric shock-like pain from the back of my head to my forehead and behind my eyes, light sensitivity, numbness and tingling. Baclofen helped for a few years, and it mostly went away, though I still get flare ups if I spend too long hunched over. Mine was likely triggered by a combo of whiplash and terrible posture from marathon study sessions in college.

So glad you got your answer and a treatable diagnosis - rooting for your recovery!</div>

ChatGPT has been a godsend in understanding my options, advocating for myself, understanding symptoms and all the intricacies of this disease.

It is an unfortunate fact of the human species that very few people are willing to part with large amounts of their wealth, no matter how staggeringly large that wealth is. Yeah there are exceptions, e.g., Bill Gates has already given away tens of billions, I expect at least him and a few others follow through on The Giving Pledge... but it's very rare.

We don't need to eliminate billionaires, but if our goal is to raise the quality of life of everyone, which I think should be the ultimate goal of any human endeavor and especially a government, then billionaires need to be _required_ to fund a large portion of what should be robust, universal social services and welfare programs. The very worst-off person must have a decent, comfortable quality of life and financial security... then they can make all the money and go play on their superyachts all they want.</div>

You mean it succeeded 30 percent of the time? Even with worst case scenario of slow gradual improvements that can go up to 50 percent success rate by the end of this year. 50 fucking percent of real-world office tasks automated away. That is thousands of of hours of work that were done by people before AI. 

I just love the framing of these articles, highlighting the 70 percent failure instead of the 30 percent success as if that 30 percent success is not a huge achievement.

These journalists are really pathetic. I can't really think of a more useless entity than being the guy who writes these stuff.</div>

If you have some regulatory responsibility over the data you transmit and you send 100 million messages a year 10% of that being wrong could fuck you.

As a hypothetical think about an ecommerce system that processes orders to go out from a warehouse and it gets 10% or orders wrong. It would be unusable.

Say you try to automate a system that ships medication and it ships the wrong medication 5% of the time. You'd be done for.

You can't iterate over time to get to a 99.9% success rate because you can't just conduct an experiment with your revenue stream failing 70% of the time while you tune it.</div>

Imagine a utopia where AI improved your productivity by just 20% so you could keep your same pay but work a 4-day work week. A person can dream…</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">No, 30% increased efficiency does not mean 30% less needed labor. That could be true if we were living in some planned economoy, but we do not. Companies are competing with each other, so they can't just cut people just because they have become more efficient. For research and development you also wouldn't cut funding just because everything got more efficient, because people would want new scientific breakthroughs as fast as possible, for example getting new cancer treatment or finding new ways to solve climate change.</div>
