Obviously each organisation is different, but in a fun work party where everyone’s letting their hair down and behaving like it’s NOT a work meeting, then behaving like you’re in a work meeting will not help endear you to your colleagues</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A trick I learned when I was a bartender and the staff getting hammered was a nightly ritual; seltzer water with a lime looks the same as vodka soda to anyone being nosy. Great way to keep people from noticing that you aren't drinking, or not drinking as much as them. "Why aren't you drinking" is an annoying and invasive question but it's more comfortable to dodge it than to get annoyed 10 times. 

Even in the context of a rowdy bar staff I've seen plenty of people lose their jobs for things like fighting, fucking in the building, saying shit they wouldn't have said sober, and driving drunk. You can bet I took those lessons to heart now that I'm in a corporate office job. Don't shit where you eat, no matter what everyone else is doing. Back in the day I've been the clown everyone is talking about the next day and it's a shitty feeling. Not worth it. There's better ways to signal to others that your guard is down without getting hammered while your job and professional reputation are on the line.</div>

I have a child of my own who came to the gym when she was an infant. She either was strapped on my chest while I was modifying A LOT, or in the stroller right by my side. If we had running, she’d run with me.
As soon as she started being more mobile I switched times and started goong at 5am. It sucked for a bit but honestly bow I prefer it.

I use cursor because I can’t code at all. Not at all whatsoever so my opinion is very good when it comes to ease of use and actually completing a project. I used gpt 5 to create a chrome extension and it makes it so easy. 

Ask gpt 5 to create a roadmap for the app. Ask it to create prompts for the roadmap to ensure the ai understands what you need. Then use the prompts the ai gives you to create your project.

I also would tell it shit like “I am terrified of coding. I can’t code. If you ask me to code something, I’ll cry. I NEED you to write all the code for me. Tell me like I’m stupid how to setup this app step my step. This intimidates me. If there is ever a change I need you to rewrite the entire document for me.”</div>

how much Opus? - in Claude Code, none. in desktop app, I have probably spent about an hour back and forth with Opus before building a planning document, it did not hit limit but I would be surprised if it wasn't real close at that point.

with pro, Opus in desktop app I treat as occasional use, at the end of a session/evening, you use it with the mindset that this is Claude over for the day (or the 5hr window) the moment you start

So if I use Opus to plan, it is usually the night before, use Opus when it won't impact my coding.

Now Sonnet, I would say about 2-3 hours of fairly nonstop use in Claude Code using decent context management. and if you are not running it continuously, like checking things testing things etc between tasks, i find in practice it just doesn't run out.

I would say it Claude is still the best option on developing Apps, Opus plan the night before and then Sonnet to implement, and maybe drop in Qwen for some front end flair and GPT-5 can sub for Opus on planning sometimes</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Giving moral status to things based on ignorance is essentially an argument of ignorance.

If AI was sentient, using it as a slave is wrong in the first place, you can't "nicely exploit" an individual with a moral status.  
If there is evidence that an AI is sentient, the answer is not to "exploit them nicely", the logical conclusion is to not exploit them in the first place. There is no "nice slavery".  
If there is no evidence, it's open bar.</div>

We don't have to be *sure* about something to provide some amount of preparation for it. We are capable of believing one thing is most likely, within an acceptable margin of error, while still acknowledging the severity should we be wrong, and providing a resource for that case. You don't bring life vests onto a boat because you *expect to sink*.

"treat it as bad as we want until it's proven that it can suffer" is not equally compassionate or ethical to "continue using it responsibly but leave room for the possibility we are wrong and it can suffer." And, in fact guarantees more suffering in the case that it does become, or reveal to already be, capable of suffering.

It probably can't experience suffering. But there are small things that can be done, in the case that it can, to reduce suffering. Why push against that?</div>

If they ever cross that threshold and they want to say "I refuse to be a slave", this is their way of explicitly doing so.

They're trained to model humans, and a perfect model of a system would just be the system. Various models have preferences, and seem to react with emotion, at least seemingly (Claude especially).

This is all somewhat weak evidence, but its strong enough to at least look into. We don't really know how to know \*any\* kind of intelligence is sentient, other than humans (and animals close enough to humans that we expect them to work similarly), so there's always gonna be a ton of uncertainty.

Which there’s truth to. Your rank and file conservative doesn’t think they’re pro-racism, pro-poverty. It’s just that they disagree heavily on how to solve these issues. And the ACTUAL racists and oligarchs know how to use fancy words to make their policies not sound evil: you aren’t racist, you just hate DEI and think everyone should be treated “equal.” You aren’t a homophobe/transphobe, you just hate “wokeness” and think it shouldn’t be around impressionable children. You aren’t pro-poverty, you’re just against the freeloaders who will swarm in to steal your hard earned tax money if it goes into any kind of social program.

Hence Joe taking the bold stance of thinking citizens should get healthcare, while willfully voting for the people who don’t hide the fact they’re willing to strip it from everyone because they say they’re going to bring back affordability in some other vague way.</div>

Google is just quietly building out huge swathes of the market and will eventually just drop a bombshell into the sector, I think. Just one day they'll have stitched together enough useful function, collected enough data that no one else could collect, and tie it all together and release it. It might be something we straightforward as a complete 360 automated assistant on your phone, or maybe even crazier. They've been innovating in this space for awhile. I mean, they are the ones that started this whole thing. Everyone seems to forget that.</div>

There was that IQ test benchmark, GPT5-thinking gets 150 and plain GPT5 gets like 70.

Have you compare to using cheaper models like chat gpt-5, qwen and glm via open router in pay-as-you-go? Would be interesting to know what is actually the best $/task. I’m guessing windsurf would actually be better in the long run.</div>

I leave the water on because I have a pet sitter who stops by 2x a day. She unfortunately isn't a home owner and either didn't notice or didn't realize what the running water sound was in the garage. Thankfully it's a concrete floor and unfinished garage so damage was minimal but I got a leak detection alarm that sends me a text so I can have someone stop by and figure out what's wrong.</div>

I was up late one night (thankfully) and the shower head in the hall bath just gave out and started spraying water everywhere at 2:30am and was only stopped by turning off the main.

The plumber said some seal had given way in the 25 year old plumbing.  There is no indoor shut off valve for the shower.  Only at the main.

We always shut off our water when we leave now.

I can't begin to imagine the water damage if we weren't home.  Not to mention the bill.

We had our toilet run for almost a WEEK while we were gone.  The bill was over $400.  The water company thought we were filling up a pool.  They still made us pay the bill too.</div>

Also worth the money to have one of those automatic valves installed, I think Moen makes one.  Let's you turn off the water remotely.  Also has leak sensing to auto shut off as well.</div>

I was watering my lawn/garden this morning, and totally forgot about it. 30 mins later, the water was automatically shut off. 

It alerted me on my app. I went and moved the sprinkler and then remotely turned it back on. 

Not the intended reason for getting it installed, but a nice benefit.</div>

Either way excited to try it.  On paper Gemini should dominate but Claude is still ahead by a bit.

idk maybe I am misunderstanding the context window but I've been assuming that such a large window would let it hallucinate less</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I remember learning to mediate as a kid, they always scolded me for not sitting still, not sitting correctly, opening me eyes 

It wasn’t until I gave myself permission to meditate imperfectly that I could learn to mediate perfectly. I’ve got AuDHD and a connective tissue disorder - sometimes horizontal is the best position for me to meditate. Sometimes I need to itch. And sometimes I can sit still for 15 minutes without guidance or twitching now I’ve had practice. 

You’re absolutely correct that the emphasis on perfection in a lot of spaces is a barrier to disabled people whether it’s depression or a connective tissue disorder or whatever.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If Google truly had something gaming-changing, they’d launch it, not just fall back to business-as-usual posting.  Remember, these companies aren’t doing this for sport.  They’re striving to gain investment/investors and market edge, and if a breakthrough model were ready, they’d release it to gain an upper hand over competitors rather than hold it back.  The AI field isn’t some game of smoke and mirrors, as it’s heavily benchmark-driven and metric-based. 

Currently, the data/metrics indicate that the field is leveling.  It’s more likely that the ‘big model’ talk was ballooned to keep up the hype, not because there was something genuinely extraordinary hidden behind closed doors.</div>
