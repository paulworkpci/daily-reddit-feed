The problem is only the cost of producing the biologics - and the lack of investment money due to lower profit margins. 

The lack of investment money is also just popularity - NVDA gets to be worth 50 times earnings cause it has a reddit sub. 

It is really hard to call a field stagnant with so many new successful products from the standpoint of saving lives</div>

That's also been my experience in real life having Gemini do some web design for me. It's not fun, and I could definitely do it faster myself, but I like seeing what it's capable of.</div>

Sometimes it blows the models out of the water but a lot of times it's not producing the best content.

                                <div class="reply-body">Unfortunately the highest Porsche's are the same game. 918, Turbos, and the GT3RS are all DCT. 

So long as they keep the GT3 with manual that's good, though I would love if they offered the GT3RS. 

I went C8Z06, but if it were possible for me to get one I would've went GT3 in a heartbeat 10x over for the manual. 

I've been a Corvette guy, but I'm eyeballing Porsche heavily in the last few years for still keeping the stick alive. Especially now that GM has heavily encrypted the new widebody C8s to make tuning impossible, half the fun of Corvettes was cheap modifications for big power and that's no longer a thing.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The irony is that nobody wanted a manual Ferrari for many years - the take rate on the last cars it was offered in was absolutely atrocious.


As an example, out of the 6025 Ferrari 612s, only 199 were ordered with a manual.


I believe the take rate for the 599 was even worse, with only 30 manual cars ordered.</div>

Ferrari had optimized its supply chain and manufacturing processes for the F1 box after the F355. Dealers also pushed for the F1 hard because it was a $4-5k option to pad their margin (much like Scuderia shields are now). They also would tell people to order the F1 because it would hold value better as well.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think it's less that nobody wanted them, and more that their automatic gearboxes were the hot new thing.

They marketed the f1 gearbox really well as a high tech, racing inspired transmission. Then you had the added benefit that the shifts were so much faster than a person. So at the time it seemed like a no brainer. Buy the faster car with the futuristic transmission instead of the old school 6 speed.

Of course now we look back and realize that was a mistake. Everything is so fast now, you can get Rav4 that do 0-60 in under 6s. So we've shifted the focus to driver engagement and experience rather than speed. That just wasn't really the case at the time though</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly one of the upsides of Grok was that it exposes some of the least informed people on Twitter to real fact checked information. Now it just spins its own narratives with zero evidence. Note that if you chat with the Grok 3 in private it also says that narratives that Jews control Hollywood is a conspiracy. So there seem to be multiple models, one lobotomized for the Elon agenda and one that is capable of freely responding.</div>

It took you nine months to grow that baby and it will take you at least that long to get back to baseline. Your biology is still being challenged 24/7–certainly with lack of sleep, and if you’re like most first time Moms, stress hormones through the roof. Also, if you’re nursing, you’re a round the clock food factory. Give yourself some grace.

Life is a marathon, not a sprint. You’re in a different phase for a little while. You’ll get back to your previous level in the fullness of time. There are women who are mothers in my gym who are absolute beasts. There are several who were dedicated athletes and strong performers who have dialed it back now that they have infants and no doubt they’ll be ramped back up when they’re ready.</div>

I’d say it took 6-9 months for me to get back to my regular level. My toddler is now 2 and I’m hitting PRs and feeling great again. I will say due to fatigue (hello 5am wakeups) and scheduling I’ve stopped going to a CrossFit gym and just started paying for CrossFit programming to do at a commercial gym. You sound like you were in way better shape than I was pre pregnancy so just be patient (I know that’s hard) and you’ll be back stronger than before!</div>

That's one of the dumbest takes I've ever seen on this sub, and that's saying something. Firstly you shouldn't be looking to politicians to solve all your problems. And if they somehow could, why wouldn't you elect them again?</div>

Take love

Any form of the word, many shapes of

So perfect, Hollywood ending

All you need is love, go and ask John Lennon

Love make a man ill, make a man kill

Make a man take a stand making mountains out of ant hills

Stand still, pay attention

Watch love, meet aggression

Man's got his hands on another man's woman

Now that other man's got a gun in his hand, pullin'

Love or die, make a man act high

See a god and Allah ain't scrappin' in the back yard

It ain't hate, it's love that makes us take

Lives away and make dyin' okay

And who am I to say if you should die for love

Love what you have but it's never enough</div>

During this time, I’ve also built my own MCP with specialized sub-agents: an Investigator/Planner, Executor, Tester, and a Deployment &amp; Monitoring Agent. It all runs via API with built-in context and memory handling to gracefully resume when limits are exceeded.

I plan to open-source this project once I add a few more features.

can’t put my finger on it but lately its doing super dumb things, making new random files, creating new i18n files in the wrong folder, using the completely wrong approach to data fetching,  ignoring all process in CLAUDE.md 

i’ve had a really bad weekend with it and it’s literally made me start my project again for a third time because it’s trashed my approach twice now

i’ve built some great things with sonnet, but opus keeps doing dumb stuff, maybe it’s because i expect more of it?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Ok, yes, I just hit a hospital. While it may be bad for PR, let’s take a step back and evaluate how **this can still further your military objectives:**


1. It will inspire **terror** in the hearts of the enemy population, undermining morale.

2. The hospital was likely **filled with wounded combatants**.

3. It was **definitely** filled with doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals- who, having been reduced to mangled heaps of smoldering limbs, will now be **unable to treat wounded enemy combatants in the future.**


So even though we didn’t get the weapons factory this time, let’s not let that stop us from considering the damage to the enemy’s war effort we still managed to inflict. After all, it’s a lot easier to build new bombs than it is to train new doctors!</div>

This tactic violates international humanitarian law, puts innocent lives at risk, and manipulates public perception for propaganda. Ignoring it allows war crimes to go unchallenged and shifts blame away from those deliberately endangering civilians. Speaking out defends the principles meant to protect non-combatants and ensures accountability where it’s due.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I really like the framing that, for the first time, capital is going to replace labor. Can you imagine how big a wet dream this is for capitalists? No more negotiations, rights, minimum wages, or disputes. Just pure outputs. 

But he's partly right, people will lose jobs. They make it sound utopian, that can only happen if there's some kind of UBI. Unless you're the government of China, which can move fast at a massive scale, the US politicians will hem and haw and still abide by the capitalists till there is lots of damage and there's a real danger the changes might come too late. I want to be optimistic, but everyone is ignoring the writing on the walls.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It is astonishing to me that there is a notion here that the needs of people will be met voluntarily by those who control AI and hold all the power. These same people, the billionaires, are pouring trillions between them, into AI in order to attain this power. Rather than use their resources to help humanity, they are in the business of replacing it. These parasites don't even pay tax, they corrupt and manipulate, that is what they do. If you consider that every human endeavour will be performed by a new artificial humanity, then there really is no future, and certainly not the utopian dream land described here. The only people going skiing will be the billionaires, the rest of us will be fighting for our food.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah I think the UBI talk is a dream to the current state of humanity. The goalposts for what employment looks like are going to move. More high skilled jobs in things like engineering/sciences and people interaction/care jobs. At least the good news in terms of this scenario is that we’re not growing really population wise in a lot of developed nations. The rates are below replacement level which means less need for jobs when robotics and AI really start to replace the workforce. I think in the near future we are going to see a lot manual labor jobs become commonplace. I.e agriculture/farm hands, robotics manufacturing. At least until those get replaced by robots…</div>
