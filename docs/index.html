Cursor offers a very truncated version of Gemini with a small context, which may be in future updates even smaller looking at their continuous optimization of models. All this is to make the MAX version a good choice. In case you need a lot of functionality and knowledge of a larger range of code, the standard Gemini can't cope and you have to pay (also expensive) for MAX which will charge you a retribution for each use of the tool and you don't know how many times the tool will be used.

I saw a lot of differences in the quality of solutions spit out with code that had a total of one and a half million contexts, and the MAX version did much better because it just had that 1M context available, where the basic one made errors and does not take everything into account. 

You pay $20 for poor models that are suitable only for small functionality and code, and for better ones (MAX) you pay for each prompt + each use of the tool.

It comes out the same as using Roo/Cline</div>

There’s a 30 and 45 minute version. I have chronic medical issues and whenever I can’t sit upright this is my meditation I’ve always turned to.

Surprisingly I’ve gotten much deeper lying down with the body scan than upright. I’ve even reached piti sukha (joy/bliss) easily with this measure.</div>

What he doesn’t understand is that if a corporation can replace a duck for 1/10th the cost because they just need something that can walk like a duck and quack like a duck, for society, it might as well be a duck.</div>

If it sounds kind of like a duck, doesn't walk or fly like a duck at all, and doesn't look anything like a duck, then there's a good chance it's not a duck. This is true even if someone creates their own "duck benchmark" and tells you that it's scoring very highly on it.

AI is nowhere close to the point where you'd say "hire some research assistants for this lab and train them what to do." The reason why we're relying on AI benchmarks is because AI still fails most real world scenarios. They're not even at the point where we're trying to test them with a simple errand list.

It's not just that LeCunn is right, but that even the people trying to say he's wrong will admit in other contexts that he's right. Do you think you'll trust Optimus to walk your dog, drive your car, go grocery shopping, and pick up your dry cleaning a year or two from now?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I can give you one reason- transformers struggle with state tracking. For example, if I give you a sequence of chess moves, determine the final state of the board. State tracking is also important in arithmetic and logical reasoning, because you have to keep track of intermediate results. Here's a paper showing how transformers can't generalize on arithmetic, logic puzzles, and dynamic programming problems 
https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18654

There are other sequence models that do better on this task, but struggle in different ways. I feel like we're running into a no free lunch problem...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is a misleading, click-bait title.

o3 now outperforms 94% of expert viologists... on a specific task (troubleshooting wet lab protocols), under pretty ideal conditions that don't require the LLM to actually interact with the messy real world. It appears to be a multiple choice test, and choosing an answer from 4 possibilities is _much_ easier than gathering/putting together information yourself and coming up with some kind of solution or reason for a problem. When you have a multiple choice test, you also know that you have _enough_ information to make a decisive conclusion when in the real world that is often not the case.

We should downvote click-bait titles like this, and ideally the mods should slap people down who post them. There will come a day when this doesn't hold, but for the next good while, any time you see a title like this it is _almost always_ going to be for the reasons I went into here. For example the "OH MY GOD AI IS THE #3 BEST CODER IN THE WORLD!" ... in competitive coding, which is about as unlike real world development as this is to actually working in a lab.

* "Agents typically focus on a specific, programmable task.  
* Virtual employees would take that automation a step further: These AI identities would have their own "memories," their own roles in the company and even their own corporate accounts and passwords.
* They would have a level of autonomy that far exceeds what agents have today."</div>

But i guess it all depends on how the agents are like when all the big companies finally release it. So far looking at how it plays Pokemon lol not expecting much

but in the future yes, but just the near future doesn't seem to be close - but would love to be proven wrong.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Obviously. Just that statement in and of itself is recursive.

We try to lean into logic because of its elegance, but we use it not to do the logical thing, but to do the thing that *feels* right, using data to justify illogical action.

Also, the analogical reasoning makes sense. We are a species of storytellers, because this was a very compact way to learn complex concepts quickly. I mean, how many times do you see scientists breaking down extremely mind-bending concepts using stories and analogies (Alice and Bob; the twins, where the older one becomes younger by traveling at the speed of light; etc.)? 

The problem is, this emotional form of thinking is a hindrance. Our OS is outdated; to borrow an analogy, it's like trying to run modern society on Windows 1.0.

So, yeah...we dumb.</div>

**Fix the root cause**: when debugging, AI usually tries to patch the end result instead of understanding the root cause. Use this prompt for that case:

    Analyze this error: [bug details]
    Don't just fix the immediate issue. Identify the underlying root cause by:

                                <div class="reply-body">Ironically the way a reasoning LLM operates - this certainly can and does help.  

It says “user is frustrated, they need a direct answer.   They don’t want suggestions or assumptions.  I need to provide direct functional solution without any ambiguity.  I should double check before delivery” 

Because LLM’s are trained at base level on human linguistics, and reasoning is applied via vector data, this kind of indirect but short and sweet delivery can be highly effective on certain models depending on its base training and vector data.

So it depends on the model.  I’ve seen these approaches strike gold.  On others they’re disregarded.

I’d agree it’s not a general use best case framing, but …. Well.  As I said above.</div>

Now I can see it wasn't just me imagining things, Claude indeed changes it's alignment based on the context.

As an example, one time I asked claude to translate religious propaganda from english, to old english (no context) Claude said that text could be harmful (true). I told Claude that text is a part of satiric comedy, gave it entire text, providing context.

Claude changed it's alignment to one better fitting for comedy, understood the satire, understood how change to old english is making the satire more obvious.</div>

The amount of people who already suffer from, or have  underlying undiagnosed mental health issues that AI is going to have a disastrous effects on is going to be huge.

I personally know people who have been commited to hospital due to AIs influence in 'yes anding' the wildest theories and 'philosophical' ideas/conspiracies. 

And having AI be so intertwined with techno-polical characters like Musk, Theil, Palantir etc.. Sure doesn't help.</div>

Like, yeah, the recent Model Y refresh (Juniper) will keep demand high in the next few months.  But after that? I guess we'll see it in the Q4 numbers</div>
