                                <div class="reply-body">There is a certain level of wealth one reaches where they functionally stop being human. Like, as in, the term "human being" no longer accurately describes their situation or behavior.

I mean that quite seriously. They are no longer tethered to material needs or motivations. They never have to think about how they are going to feed themselves. They never have to be concerned with personal risks. They can set a giant pile of money on fire, on purpose, and the next morning not only will the pile will have put its own fire out, it will have then doubled in size spontaneously. There is no amount of "fucking around" that will bring them to the "find out" phase as long as the gravity-well of their wealth persists.

The reason these people don't empathize with anyone is because they are fundamentally disconnected from the most basic human experiences, motives and needs. They are amoral meat machines that command attention purely because the line go up, and our society has decided that they *should be* bulletproof, even if on occasion someone happens to test that theory and the test comes back negative.

It seems the most effective and likely the only way to reintroduce human empathy into these creatures is to reintroduce the concept of fear into their lives, in the slim hopes that they will realize that the fear they feel is something *other people* also feel.

                                <div class="reply-body">American voters put tech CEOs in an impossible position.

America voted in a president who was well known to exact revenge against those who criticize him and to reward to those who glorify him.

If **you** were a tech CEO, what would **you** do?

If you criticize Trump publicly, you know some Trump-appointed toady will take revenge and screw your business.  Maybe you'll have to lay off 100 people or even shut down and lay off everyone.

**Would you speak your mind, knowing that others will suffer the consequences?**

Some government employees face a similar dilemma:  Say you voted for Trump or get fired:  [link](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/incoming-trump-team-is-asking-white-house-national-security-council-civil-servants-about-their-loyalty).

The American people elected a vicious narcissist.  That decision is going to force a lot of people to choose between principle and pragmatism in coming years.

The good answer was, "Don't elect Trump."  Now there's no good answer.  Just icky options.</div>

The true accomplished NoSurfers who entirely quit Reddit and other online bullshit aren't posting here to tell us all their secrets.

On the other hand I feel like reading/typing here helps me form and solidify thoughts on this topic of internet addiction that nobody in the real world cares to talk about. But I'm not entirely sure that I couldn't get the same outcome from just writing in a journal for 10-15 minutes per day.</div>

I remember reading about a research paper / survey thing. They asked a group of people "Which is better, Mac or Windows and why?" The people that had the strongest opinions and insisted the other system had no value were the people who had only ever used one or the other. The people with the least info had the strongest opinions. People deeply familiar with both generally answered "well, it depends"</div>

I read a comment about how there's a few power mods that mod 100s of subs.   All those subreddits tend to end up being somewhat homogeneous and similar on some level.   Similar culture, similar injokes etc reddit pop culture I guess.   So yeah that motivated me to essentially block as many of them as I could to give me a different experience when I use this website.</div>

I agree with his main criticism is that he doesn’t push back enough against guests but that’s what he does for every guest(unless you criticize weed lol). 

And of course he has huge guests like all above, he’s the biggest media in the world… who also has the likes of Joey Diaz etc. on.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I can't believe this has so many upvotes. The entire purpose of life is to enjoy yourself by gaming, social media, eating good food, etc. And the cheaper the pleasure, the better: I don't want to have to work hard to make a lot of money for pleasure. I'm not sure how you "get pleasure from every second", but you sound a little like those people who want employees to work 70 hours per week and worship their jobs. Evil!

The entire point of productivity is to get your work done as efficiently as possible so you have MORE time for pleasure. I think you've gotten it 100% backwards.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The problem is that the more you indulge to dopaminergic activities, the more you become tolerant to them: in the short term you are "happy" but in the long term it will result in you not being satisfied with some aspects of life or straight out frustrated with them.

One could go to that hedonistic path of life, but sooner or later it will cost you dearly. If what you want is long term happiness, then searching for it ALWAYS in short term pleasure is the wrong way: your brain will get more tolerant to the dopamine. 

On the other side, reading a book may not be the most entertaining thing in the world, but it makes me happy and gives me knowledge and memories that I can use for the rest of my life. I think one should search and adquirir taste for happinnes in the peace of fruitful activities: learning an instrument, talking with your friends, reading a book, etc.

I attach these images so that we all remember what certain people have promised or affirmed. What happened to all that? let's not forget... In the screenshots are the dates (although in Spanish, which is my language, but it is still understood)

                                <div class="reply-body">I was in something for gifted kids in the 70s in Arizona.  I was tested as high IQ and skipped forward a grade and was in something called REACH with about 10 other kids.  My memories of what we actually did are hazy but we were definitely bussed to Davis Monthan AFB several times.  Was in the program after skipping 1st grade, so from 2nd-6th grade but the earlier years are the ones I don't recall much about.

I'll have to think on this.

edit to add: found it - Elementary REACH Pull Out Program

[Amphitheater Public Schoolshttps://www.amphi.com › Page](https://www.amphi.com/Page/18794)The Pull Out model is designed for *REACH students* in 1st through 6th grades. *Gifted* Learners have unique social *emotional needs*.</div>

This is what we’ve all been taught since grade school. We used to say, “freedom of speech,” and I’ve been bored to death for countless hours listening to my high school teachers and my college professors rant and rant and rant about the topic. 

Now we’ve taken the concept and turned it on its head. It’s like I don’t even know where to begin with my anger.</div>

Idk if that’s true but it’s what I believe. I don’t think any social media company should be beholden to the content moderation whims of the government. If you don’t like it you can start your own social media platform in a crowd-sourced way with other like-minded individuals and wealthy backers. If you’re less comfortable with unlimited free speech on social media then choose or create one that reflects that. I disagree with a “government gets to tell social media firms what to do because they’re so big they are ‘the public forum’” argument.</div>

Many people in the US do not realize how extreme our copyright rules have become; they're boiled frogs.  Oldsters remember that there was not always a DMCA, for example, and that it's introduction was a draconian change:

*...criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM). It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an access control, whether or not there is actual infringement of copyright itself.  In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet.*</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">David does make a really good point about automation - a model that can do 70% of tasks needed for a job will be able to fully automate 0% of those jobs.

When a model approaches being able to do 100% of those tasks, all of a sudden it can automate all of those jobs. 

A factory doesn't produce anything at all until the last conveyor belt is added 

(Obviously a lot of nuance and exceptions being missed here but generally I think it's a useful concept to be aware of)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A very common mistake being made here is assuming that the tasks required to do certain jobs are going to remain static. There’s nothing stopping a company from decomposing job responsibilities in a manner that would allow a vast majority of the tasks currently attributed to a single human to now be automated. 

You don’t need a model to handle 100% of the tasks to start putting them in place. If you can replace 70% of the time a human is working, the cost savings are already so compelling, you don’t need to wait until you can completely replace that person as a whole, when you can reduce the human capital you already have by such a significant percentage.</div>

helped curb excessive/toxic reddit usage.

Now everyone has continued like nothing has changed. We're way too reliant on these platforms that waste our time and harm our sanity

IMO: willpower is just not enough to make you quit these platforms</div>

And maybe it's just confirmation bias, but it feels like the quality of discussions and the sense of community here took a hit after that episode, and haven't fully recovered. Just my two cents though.</div>

It was mostly a bunch of power hungry moderators trying to act like they actually had power and a bunch of edge lords trying to virtue signal. The majority of posters in the sub reddit did not care, but you had to deal with them shutting down subreddits just so they could act like they had some power.

“There is a current effort happening right now, today—a push. Unprecedented push for transparency on this issue has gotten the attention of lawmakers, household names, Intel folks.

There’s whistleblowers coming forward. I’m told somewhere between 8 and 12 firsthand witnesses. *Everyone’s saying they want firsthand.* Grush was not a firsthand. Firsthand witnesses that have met in SCIFs behind the scenes.

Kirk McConnell, former Senate Armed Service Committee staff member, talks about it in The Program. Uh, it’s happening. Be patient, continue support. This story is going to be huge.”</div>

There are hundreds of nation states, tens of thousands of corporations, and billions of people on this planet. To successfully suppress AI development, you'd have to somehow police every single one of them, and you'd need to succeed every time, every day, for the rest of time, whereas AI developers only have to succeed once. The genie is out of the bottle at this point, there's no going back to the pre-AI world.</div>
