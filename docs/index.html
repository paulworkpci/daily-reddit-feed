                                <div class="reply-body">it is not that impossible as you might think at the first glance. I could easily imagine two cases:

1. You provided access to database as a separate project (e.g. for monitoring or data analysis or something) and you didn't care much about read/write permissions
2. You didn't provide direct access to database, however, you have access to database from localhost (to test something or maybe you run your app on production database)

Yes, both cases are somewhat "bad practices", but they much offen to see in real life (unless you are working in highly regulated area like banking or big corp)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">At this point I don’t think Ilya’s genius is any sort of moat for SSI; that kind of single-person talent mattered way more a few years ago than it does now. The real moat now is simply compute capacity and talent density. With so few employees (albeit very talented ones) and a compute capacity that pales in comparison to the much bigger players, there just wasn’t enough to keep the CEO from getting poached.

I’m sure SSI can still produce some very high quality AI and eventually AGI, but I don’t think the CEO would leave if he was convinced they had some sort of special sauce.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don't think there is any MOAT at all on the side of model providers. Too many companies have the financial resources to compete at the highest level. 

The only real MOAT will be having an ecosystem that can actually make use of all the models, generative and predictive alike. Right now, it looks like out of the large tech company, it's mostly Microsoft and Google that are in a position to capitalize on it. 

Other than that, large industrial providers like Siemens and obviously all the defense related companies are in a good position. Though those will probably focus more on predictive and analytical AI, with generative AI as user interfaces.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I wouldn't be so sure about that. There are plenty of huge projects that have failed because of a lack of wisdom. The more engineers and scientists you have working on the same topic, the more important it is to have them working in the right topic. In this kind of situation, where you don't have any data to be sure which approach will work and which will hit a wall, an organisation can succeed due to luck or due to wisdom.

With the last round of models, Meta ran out of luck. I don't know if Deepseek, Google, and OpenAI succeeded out of wisdom or out of luck. But I'd argue, Ilya is one of the guys who doesn't need much luck to succeed at building a much smarter AI.</div>

this is basically benchmaxing, a model needs to get to the solution on its own. If at the end of the day it needs skilled humans that already understand the question to verify the material.. the model is not needed. </div>

Memorization is not knowledge, its a skill that humans struggle with and the only way humans effectively learn starts with memorizing.

If we want to demonstrate that AI has great memory, then mission accomplished. But we kind of already know that memory is the one thing that computers have excelled at for decades.</div>

DeepSeek R1 (671B) delivers the best results: 73.2% pass@1 on HumanEval, 69.8% on MBPP, and around 49.2% on SWE Verified tasks in DevOps tests. Magistral, though not built specifically for coding, holds its own thanks to strong reasoning abilities, scoring 59.4% on LiveCodeBench v5. It's slightly behind DeepSeek and Codestral in pure code tasks.

Except I've been feeling this calling to give more of myself. I have been meditating since I was in my late teens (in my mid 30's now) and it has helped me achieved all the goals I've set for myself. Now that I have them all I feel like my life is a bit over complicated. I honestly wish I could live a low pressure life somewhere and just teach people how to meditate.

If it keeps tugging at you, maybe try teaching a few people on the side and see how it feels. You’re not weird for wanting that actually kinda wise.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Wow, thank you for sharing this. It’s beautiful that meditation has played such a deep role in shaping your journey—and even more so that you're feeling called to *give back* through it. That desire to simplify, slow down, and teach others what’s helped you... that’s very real. And honestly, more needed than ever.

You’re not alone in feeling this. I’ve felt that same pull myself, which is actually why I started my YouTube channel, *The Peaceful Pause*. It’s a small space where I share meditations and mindfulness practices—not as some big production, but just as a way to help people pause, breathe, and reconnect. It’s been my way of gently offering what I’ve learned, without needing to overhaul my whole life (at least not all at once).

You absolutely *can* shape a life around teaching meditation. Whether it's through online content, local workshops, or retreats, people are genuinely seeking that kind of calm guidance. I hope you follow the call—it sounds like you’d be an amazing teacher.</div>

None of us want to own or run a gym. This is about keeping something great alive for ourselves &amp; the other members &amp; the community.  

It's a small town with no alternatives in 20+ miles— with an active, consistent &amp; engaged members base. The box is generally coach- &amp; staff-run (less so than the current owner lately).

                        <div class="comment-body">Ownership groups rarely work, especially with multiple owners looking to do it as a 'hobby' business. There isn't enough money to go around and the division of labour gets murky. 

Eventually everyone feels some kinda way. 

Find one person who is willing to take ownership of the gym and have the group loan the individual the money with favorable terms. Use lawyer(s) for this (both groups should have their own). It is important that terms are clear: You are all still paying members. 

If nobody wants to take on full ownership, it is probably better to let it close. You can always purchase the equipment and set-up a private unit with 24/7 access.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If you all proceed, I’d get someone (preferably an attorney) to help you get an actual business organizing, duties, responsibilities, finances, etc figured out. Write it down and have people sign it.

In my experience, these types of groups struggle with “who does what” with the business. 

I had a group of friends open a gym together, 4 total, and they didn’t last a year. Once things got difficult, everyone started arguing about who was supposed to be doing what and what that was worth. In other words, some owners thought them putting up money was their only responsibility, but they were happy to complain when the gym wasn’t making any money. 

Also worth noting there’s a difference between having the finances and wanting to make you money back. Even if the gym is profitable, repayments will take longer if profits are split. Again, get an attorney to help you write out specifics on where the money goes, who gets paid when, etc. 

Last, y’all better have a lot of heart to hearts about this. Things all seem like puppies and rainbows until real money gets involved. Your highest likelihood for success is probably having one person “in charge” with several others giving input, similar to a board.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Don’t go into ownership expecting to make a lot of money, especially if you’re buying as a group. The positive side of what you’re talking about is that it sounds like you’re all wanting to buy it because you’re passionate about your gym. This is key. It takes passion to run a box because often times it’s not entirely financially rewarding like other businesses. 
Also, the more owners, the more opinions. Be very clear on what everyone’s role will be ahead of time. Eliminate conflict before it comes up. Group ownership can and often will get messy if a few people end up wanting to be the boss. Save yourselves a lot of headache by defining expectations and tasks before work even begins.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Being this friend will also probably be one of the hardest things you have to do. They won’t want to see the truth, they won’t want to hear what you have to say, and it might take them a very long time to realize that they are being abused or that they need to leave. 

Be kind, be patient, listen, and above all, be a safe space. Your friend needs your empathy and warmth a million times more than they need your input, no matter how much it feels to you like they should hear it.</div>

I agree fuck Trump, and it’s embarrassing for Joe that he endorsed Trump. That being said, orange man bad and Joe being dumb are separate issues, and I doubt Joe endorsed Trump for the sole purpose of giving the middle finger to CNN. 

CNN also did something they absolutely had no right to do. I think it’s important that people don’t just blindly follow “their” side and tow the party line just for the sake of it. It’s important to recognize when your own side crosses a line. People not doing that because they think the other side is that much worse is exactly how we got saddled with Trump in the first place. So don’t do that. 

All that being said, I understand you’re probably just venting and that I shouldn’t take your post too literally. Granted I clearly still felt the need to type out this reply lol.</div>

Especially in a non violent and increasingly easy to control situation”

Too many people in this thread have done the classic “well he should’ve complied” when all this dude did was ask for their supervisor to explain why he needed to exit his vehicle for a busted light - which is in every Americans inherit rights to question unjustified authority.  Sad to see Americans cheering and making excuses when other Americans get their rights literally punched away like this because “he was kinda annoying”</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">People say its the V8, which it is in part, but the biggest issue is pricing, a lack of a lineup, and quality.

Jeep, which basically is their bread and butter, is insanely overpriced. They tried moving it upmarket, realized they couldn't compete with the likes of Lincoln and Cadillac, decided to back track, but then forgot to lower the prices.

Not to forget that North American Stellantis is known for attrocious QC issues and electrical gremlins. Why would I spend 80K CAD on a Grand Cherokee L, only for it to have worse quality than all of its class competitors? 

Then you have the lineup. Stale and nothing. Dodge still does not have a competent competitor to the Rav 4, CRV, Escape segment. The Hornet was a flop due to pricing, the Chrysler marque is withering away and being forgotten, and there is zero synergy between the FCA and PSA branches. Bring some PSA CUV's and slap a dodge badge on them. You could literally rebadge a Peugeot 3008 to take advantage of the Corolla Cross, HRV, Taos compact CUV growth. 

And to top it off, their sales are further slumping in Europe, the one market where their lineup seems to be half competent. Those reasons, I am not too familiar with.

Stellantis has to be up there with Nissan as the most poorly run auto companies in the last 10 years.</div>

I've rented a 208 GT for like three summers in a row in Europe. Thinking of getting a 308 SW GT this summer.

I have to say...I'm overall very impressed by what Peugeot has delivered. Very sharp design, comfortable interiors, put together well, easy to drive, stupid cheap to run. 

The only thing I can't comment on is reliability, which...is probably not great.</div>

When's the last time anyone even thought about a Chrysler? It was the Chrysler 300. What happened once 300s became gimped, boring, and discontinued? People stopped going to Chrysler dealerships altogether, and they couldn't push boring Pacificas.

Buyers may not walk away with a V8, but they definitely want to go to a dealership to *see* a V8, and in a competitive car market getting people's feet on the lot is half the battle.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; there is zero synergy between the FCA and PSA branches. Bring some PSA CUV's and slap a dodge badge on them. You could literally rebadge a Peugeot 3008

Yeah this is also what I don't really understand. FCAs lineup was already stale back in 2021 when the merger happened and it hasn't really gotten better since. The way I see it, FCA was slowly withering away (both in Europe and the US) while PSA was doing pretty good but had the issue of not having any market presence in many parts of the world outside of Europe.

You'd think the obvious way to solve both of these problems would be what you just described, but it doesn't seem like they are doing that, at least not yet.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Growing up in a Dodge household, this pisses me off.

In the US market, they experienced a 25% YoY sales decline, and any car guy can tell you why; phasing out the Hemi V8. I love me a good inline-six, but in American muscle there's no replacement for displacement, and Dodge has a golden goose with the Hellcat; people want them so bad that dealerships are offering 20% over book value to buy them back and every criminals dream is to steal one. Trying to copy BMW on the I6 turbo route might've been a good move to bring back a pony car like the Dart, but not at the expense of getting rid of the engine that made Dodge Dodge.

You can point at a lot of reasons for Stellantis' decline, but my ire is pointed in the direction of one person: Carlos Tavares. Tavares was an absolute shitheel CEO, and whatever morons on the board that put him in should be booted too. "He's Ghosn 's protege" was supposed to be a red flag, not a plus. Stellantis followed Nissan into the toilet by adopting the same policies of sacrificing quality to slash production costs and perverting the marquee platforms that draw people into the brand, all while jacking up prices. The Jeep Wagoneer should be considered a sin committed against the auto world.

Hopefully this financial kick in the teeth is a wake up call for Stellantis. With recently loosened US emissions standards, it's not too late to spin those V8 plants back up and give customers what they want. If they want to survive, they're gonna *have* to.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, I think ragging on doctors too much isn't great.  Most of them are truly doing what they think is the best course for their patients.  But we have a huge doctor shortage in the US and there are always a ton of factors at play.  It is very frustrating that so many are dismissive of their patient's thoughts though.  I have managed to self-diagnose myself through doubting doctors way too many times, and ended up helping myself with another doctor or on my own.

Real, dependable AI can only help the situation.  But it needs to be much more dependable and much less hallucinatory.  I don't want to see a single doctor replaced though.  I want to see this unburden doctors.  Give them a new tool and assistant to do more with their time.  I want this to help patient self-advocacy and give them a tool to better communicate what their body is telling them to doctors.

I hate this all or nothing language.  We need to think about how this will improve and enhance humanity, not replace humanity.</div>

After telling them that 3 different AI made the same diagnostic (Chatgpt, Grok, Gemini), they ran extra test and found out they were right (detecting subtle sign of intra-abdominal adhesions).


Most doctors are really bad. They spend 5 minutes on your case and can't outperform the amount of data and knowledge AI can compute in real time. </div>

Once the doctor pointed out what it looked like on the scan, it was easy to see even for me, but ChatGPT completely failed to recognize it until I nudged it to look for that particular issue.  I was actually pretty disappointed at how poor it was.

I'm sure it will improve and I look forward to the day that it does because this involved multiple doctor visits to get the referral, then discuss the results of the MRI, and finally getting a second opinion because the first doctor seemed like he was bored.  The doctor visits alone cost me $500, so I'd love to be able to just feed the scans to AI and get the results and discuss treatment options.</div>
