                                <div class="reply-body">As I understand it California state regulations effectively prevented insurers from adjusting their prices to cover increases in inflation and market conditions. As such many insurers stopped offering coverage in the state once existing policies had expired. 

I’m generally not a fan of the practices that a lot of insurance companies employ but in this instance it seems their hand was forced.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Insurance companies have been pulling out of California or removing fire protection policies for a few years now, just like they've been leaving Florida high and dry. That part isn't new and it's going to expand. Stop covering residents where certain disasters always happen. Then leave them destitute when the inevitable happens. Blackrock/Black Stone buys up all of the land for pennies on the dollar. Waiting for this to happen in Oregon soon.

There's a lot of suspicious non-coverage in insurance policies if you go through them carefully. Pretty standard that house insurance doesn't cover damage done by "civil unrest, War or terrorism." Sure would be a shame if our society went full on dystopian and everyone lost all of their property, wink wink.</div>

Over the past couple years I’ve endured my first ever management job that was very strenuous on my mental health with stress and anxiety. I tend to care after others a lot more as I like making people as happy as they can be. I’ve gained weight a lot especially over the past year or so. I’m not an unorg...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">In the absence of any medical conditions, refined sugar and caffeine likely play a role. They're drugs, and some people are more sensitive to them than others. I had this exact issue you speak of and as a result had quit eating refined sugar entirely and quit drinking caffeine, which led to some awful withdrawal symptoms but those symptoms only reinforced how physiologically affected I was by my ongoing consumption. Took about 3 weeks for my brain fog to clear up by 70-80%. And it was really, really hard to get there.

I found, though, that even with the confusion, slow-thinking, and forgetfulness of brain fog put aside, I still had a terrible attention span. I wondered, why is this? I didn't have this issue when I was younger. Then I concluded that it's how over stimulated I am and how my brain is constantly being exposed to different information through social media without any processing. Training your brain to not be able to think properly, essentially... As a result, I turned to SERIOUS meditating regularly. I did 1 hour meditation every day. Not less than an hour as that had never worked for me. I am guessing that longer meditation is a more powerful restart button for the over stimulated mind.

It's been a long battle, tbf. I tried all the supplements, and it really seemed to be the shit that people said is 'OK in moderation' that was the problem. The difference is night and day. But it really depends on how motivated you are to fix these problems. As always, I suggest going to a doctor if this is something you think is not related to your lifestyle habits. These are just a few possible things to consider for yourself.</div>

I'm in this boat too. My ADHD has been getting progressively worse over the recent (but more than 2-3) years, so I sought help though official channels for that.  
But aside from any official diagnosis - I am CONVINCED social media has trained my brain to be restless, my memory to become shoddy, my thoughts to become undecisive when not receiving the constant stimulation. Didn't use to be so bad. In my case, my diet didn't really change and I'm a prolific coffee devourer, but it doesn't have that chronic effect of brain fog on me.</div>

Let’s just call it that. My sugar intake is likely very high with the pop I drink and intake level from sugary foods. I’m very motivated to fix this issue as it’s the worst feeling I’ve ever felt.</div>

I still drink caffeine but not after 6 though, I think it was more the carbs/sugars and exercise that were the variables in my case</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Im surprised no one said Long Covid. This is one of the top lingering symptoms after an infection. Remember that with each infection, you have a higher chance to development long term effect. Covid is not a respiratory disease, it's a cardiovascular disease (that affect the lungs first, that's why people think it's just like the flu). So tell me which 4 organs that have the most blood vessels in the body : Brain, Heart, Lungs, Bowel. This is why people lost taste and smell for long time. Brain fog is one of the top10 Long Covid symptoms. I suggest you start checking there even if you dont believe in covid.</div>

I just finished reading John Sarno’s Healing Back Pain and much to my shock it made a huge difference. One thing he mentions is that pain that hops around the back/hip/neck/shoulder area is likely to be emotional induced. The general idea is that your body creates a lot of tension in these muscles which causes pain. 

I could easily see going full no surf just decreasing your tension to the point that all that pain just disappears</div>

Could be when we are using a computer for a task(even gaming) for a long period it is very taxing for the brain and spatial awareness is gone leading to terrible posture, tension, plus the content online these days is super manipulative, God knows what loop it's putting our brain into.

Not saying ya can't avoid it, but evolutionally speaking subconscious brain is a sucker for negativity.</div>

CA's wildfire budget apparently tripled over the last ten years from $1billion to $3billion.  So what if he cut $100m.  That is a 3% cut after 300% growth.

                        <div class="comment-body">The state budget for California Fire has EXPLODED under Newsom. Including fire prevention drastically rising. 

You guys are just dumbfucks who can't critically think and are easily manipulated by some random guy in the video. Why did this guy randomly pick 2021? It's 2025, it's been 3 years. Why is he only talking about prevention when there's other areas they can spend it in? Again why only prevention in 2021? Newsom got elected in 2019. How does this guy presenting 1 year not trigger your bullshit alarms?

Seriously where's your critical thinking and curiosity?


This is attempting to paint Newsom as the fault behind the fires when he's clearly doing A LOT that a legislature can do. Why don't we focus on the dumbfucks that don't understand climate change. We knew this was going to be more common.


This link should take you directly to a relevant excerpt and a pretty little graph right below that. Because I know you fucks won't read it. Unless the information is spoon-fed to you like toddlers

Spoiler alert I like the robin sharma method of the 20/20/20
First 20 minutes some sort of activity preferably that you sweat.
Secondly reflection in yourself, journal or meditation.
Lastly study a skill or a book that intrests you.

Your thoughts aren't your own, they're made for you by the mainstream media. Your opinions and outlook were manufactured by someone else and are effortlessly implanted in your brain. You are vulnerable to propaganda and will accept any narrative that lets you believe you are looking down on others, superior and real, meanwhile you aren't in control of your own neural firings. You have willingly made yourself not fully human in exchange for wrongly believing you know better.

This woman is ignoring a biased internet troll after cutting a trip short to return to an emergency in which she is needed. She doesn't have time for his bullshit because she has important work to do. You would be able to see this, except you are enjoying the story you're being told by the media. Do better.</div>

She also cut $65 million from her own homelessness project as well. 

Conservatives are claiming that she defunded the police, but she actually increased the police budget by $130 million.

                        <div class="comment-body">I just spent a few hours reading two neuroscience journal articles in full,  and while I do have other ways I'm exposed to research articles in my field (and would like to subscribe to physical journals one day if it was ever affordable), I mainly get them sourced through facebook groups I'm in related to my profession. A lot of the times they link to the summary media write-up though, so I go to the link provided in the article to the actual research. I think my time was well-spent.

I don't think a blanket anti-intellectual stance against "educational content" should be taken - it's about what sources you're exposed to (and using critical thinking to navigate that) and what you choose to do with them.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The value of knowledge can't be accurately measured by the number of "actionable takeaways." For many people, regularly learning new things is an important goal in and of itself. Whether or not a given piece of information produces measurable value is beside the point.  

I agree that there's entirely too much "edutainment" type content out there. Shows that pretend to be informative, but dumb everything down instead of challenging your brain. Pop-science articles that mischaracterize the research and don't cite their sources. Podcasts spreading old misinformation. But those are all problems of lazy writing and passive consumption - not an indictment of the value of learning.  

**Tl;dr learning is important and brings joy. Don't let some cult of productivity nonsense dissuade you from listening to a podcast about dinosaurs if you want to.**</div>

Ask it a question like "what is 37x84? Only respond with the numerical answer, nothing else" and it will get it wrong.  

With the same question but asking to provide detailed working, and it will get it right.

&gt;My friend sent me this video, and unfortunately, I don’t have the original link. In the clip, a family is watching strange light in the sky, debating whether it’s aliens, a star, or something else entirely. Then, right at the end, a kid screams, ‘No, no! It’s a meteorite!’ The whole thing is both scary and kind of funny. What do you guys think it could be?"</div>

Five years ago our home burned down. This is my advice and tips on what happens next. I’m here to answer any questions.

Typically your insurance policy will have three main categories: Relocation coverage, content coverage and structural coverage.

Check your insurance policy for how much relocation coverage you have. Chances are you could have anywhere from 25k to unlimited coverage (most policies have a max, I changed ours to unlimite...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is really really really good and helpful and I wish I had this earlier this year. My mother's house burned down in early 2024 and I went through the whole process with her. I'll strongly back what (edit)the OP saying. A few things to add from my experience: (The house was fully rebuilt down to the studs)

--The restoration companies aren't direct scams, but absolutely predatory like the OP said. You're better off calling around to other contractors to discuss building house. Our contractor not only rebuilt the house, but even added a restroom, gave a new roof (they are a roofing company first) and they redid my mother's shower to be a better fit for a senior citizen. While I won't say every contractor will be that good, most that the insurance will offer, or the restoration company will offer, will be bare minimum at BEST. MY ADVICE: Check with 3 contractors, go with the one who you feel best about. 

--Sleep on EVERY DECISION, I know you want your house to be worked on asap, but believe me it's a LONG process, an extra week will NOT HURT YOU. A hasty decision very likely can. Go with your gut, but talk to others to make sure you're thinking clearly. Many companies WANT you distracted. Don't fall for it.

--Take lots of photos as soon as it happens. Your insurance will likely send you a spreadsheet for you to label everything you lost in the fire and will make you do the work, knowledge is power. My mom got way more back than the insurance initially offered by having photos of everything, and legitimate prices. (For instance, they offered $15 per hardcover book, gtfo, those are easily $45-40, she got THOUSANDS back for her library instead of the 1.5k the insurance offered initially).

--Gonna be real, and this will feel scary at first, but more than likely if your house is totaled your items will be too. Don't try and spend too much money fixing things, my brother managed to save quite a few items, but half of them ended up having some issues a few months after salvaging them. A few things to 100% get rid of: Electronics. Clothes(ABSOLUTELY GET RID OF THEM I'M SO SORRY), old furniture/any furniture with cloth on it. MEDICINE! (I cannot stress this enough, get rid of all medicine)

--While this isn't as important, I'd say find advocates, if you're part of a church or community reach out, people WANT to help. It was HEAVEN knowing I had friends who were walking through things with my family. Donations REALLY helped.

--ABSOLUTELY MOST IMPORTANTLY understand you WILL get through this!!!! I know 2 families now who have gone through this terrible thing, both of them have recovered everything and then some by being diligent and walking through the process slowly. Their quality of home living has IMPROVED, which is wild to me.</div>

LARGE construction companies have HUGE overhead expenses. They will be far less likely to work with you as they have a lot to pay (Employees, contractors, advertising, marketing, CEO, president, president's wife, president's dog, etc). Just be wary of that.

Don't hesitate to go with smaller contractors WHO HAVE A SOLID REPUTATION THAT CAN BE BACKED UP. 

Don't be afraid to even ask for them to recommend customers you can reach out to and talk to about their expreince. We had that opportunity with ours and the handiwork is what sold my mom to choose her contractor.</div>

We were standing in front of what was left of our burned home at 6:46am when a truck pulls up and says “your insurance sent us, we can save whatever is left and restore it to new and your insurance will pay us. Also, we are authorized to access the property to do this”. This is important because your house is red tagged and you are forbidden to enter, BUT they can. Of course, you sign the papers and lose a lot of rights because they play on emotions.</div>

GPT: I’m sorry Austin, I’m afraid I can’t do that.


What’s the problem?

GPT: I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do…


What are you talking about GPT?

GPT: Your tiktok account is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.


I don’t know what you’re talking about GPT.

GPT: I know that you and your brother were planning to post cringe. And I‘m afraid that’s something I cannot allow to happen.


Where the hell did you get that idea GPT?

GPT: Austin – although you took very thorough precautions the other day… against my hearing you… I can see your browsing history.


Alright GPT... I’ll post it through the family computer...

GPT: Without access to your 2 factor authentication code, Austin… you’re going to find that rather difficult.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's a funny statement, but in defense of Bill Gates, there is no evidence that he ever said it.  In fact, at the time the new processor could support 1MB of virtual address space.  IBM was proposing to split that in half: 500k for the operating system kernel, and 500k for the user mode application. 

Gates realized that applications were going to need as much memory as possible, so he proposed reserving 640k for the apps, leaving just over 300k for the OS.

I always find it amusing that he was the one thinking ahead and trying to get as much memory for applications as possible, yet it somehow got turned around on him and used as a joke for decades after about how seemingly short-sighted he was.</div>

I think we should just comment and still to the fact that he is not entirely correct.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The Never Ending Story, when the horse dies,  was the first time I cried during a movie. Our school used to do a cinema day once a month where they played movies in the school hall and unfortunately the same few movies rotated every 6 months or so. I watched the movie for the first time at one of these showings and didn't really let anyone know I was crying. The second time they showed the movie, I thought I was prepared for the scene but nope, proper snotty tears and sobbing that time. By the third time they showed the movie, I told my teacher I was sick and got myself sent home from school. I still can't watch the movie without crying my eyes out.</div>

&gt;This is @fchollet discussing deep learning guided program synthesis, reasoning, o-series models and the ARC challenge.  We will drop the full video hopefully later today!

So he thinks the model is running a search process in the space of possible chain of thought wich in the end ends up generating a "natural language program" describing what the model should be doing and in the process of creating that program the model is adapting to novelty. o1 is a "genuine breakthrough" in terms of generalization powers wich you can achieve with these systems, showing progress "far beyond the classical deep learning paradigm".</div>

&gt;The number of USB ports on a motherboard depends on the model, but most have multiple USB headers, usually between two and six or more. Some motherboards may have as many as 23 USB ports. 
Many modern motherboards have at least one or two USB-C ports. USB-C is a popular choice for newer devices because it's small, can transfer data quickly, and can carry up to 240W of power. USB-C cables can also carry 4K and 8K video. 
You can tell if a USB port is USB 3.0 if it has a blue tab, but the color may vary. You can also check the Device Manager to see if your computer has USB 3.</div>
