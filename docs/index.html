Just a reminder, he pays smart people to work. He pays very very smart engineers to create, design, and build everything and then stamp his name on it.

He's a poster boy. He's a salesman. He is not some Tony Stark motherfucker, he's the monopoly man who owns Boardwalk.</div>

I listened to five minutes of one of those group chat twitter things with "Adrian" about Laura Loomer the other day and Dittman is controlling the either thing, making decisions, cutting people off. People are treating him as if he's Elon then fully pretending he isn't. At one point someone loudly announces Elon was just live streaming some gaming at same time Dittman was speaking so there's the proof, it's not Elon. 

The gaming clip was about five minutes, with only seconds of Elon talking occasionally.  Easily couldn't been him.

The whole thing is just bizarre, Elon Musk is a weird fucking guy.</div>

For context: I'm in my 30's, have a wife and two young kids, started my freelance consulting business in early 2024 (after leaving corporate at end of 2023 for better family balance), and have no extraordinary medical conditions for either myself or a loved one (which I am extremely grateful for) (knock on wood).

Having said that, prior to 2024, I constantly changed what activities and categories I tracked, which screwed around with me trying to see a meaningful 'year'.

Last year was the first full year I had a stable set of categories (what you see above). Lesson learned was 'less is more', and I ended up spending way less time agonising over or amending allocations.</div>

I agree, there is a lot to be said about the image being built around productivity, but the boring and underwhelming reality is that the secret sauce is no sauce. I like the phrase "deep respect for your current state" and I agree with it, effectiveness is rooted in humility and the appreciation of the variables at play, if you steal from yourself today, tomorrow will come to settle the debt.</div>

Yes I find there's sometimes almost a 'fad diet' aspect to it, where people dismiss their current selves with all its nuances, then enter a vicious cycle of seeking an external solution 'promise', and then getting frustrated when it doesn't mesh for them.

And I definitely agree with your "steal today, debt tomorrow", it's definitely something I still struggle with today, on a daily basis as well as longer term, and to be honest one of the reasons I'm tracking my time like this!</div>

There is a reason why ISIS who claims to be the ''khalif'' of islam to have never attempted an attack on israel even during the outrage of the world but guess who they were attacking in that time? Yes peaceful muslim countries left and right. Isis has nothing to do with Islam they are made to confuse the people who do not follow the real logic. Let me re-assure you this if you see anything with ISIS in the name know that the u.s has an agenda behind it.</div>

My library doesn't just have books.

* digital books, audiobooks with libby
* digital movies with Kanopy
* digital books, comics, music, and movies with Hooplah

And lots more. If I didn't have a toddler I'd probably never step foot in the Library.</div>

But in very simple terms, you are close- they are controlled by two spinning permanent magnets. 

Which could still be useful, in certain applications.</div>

It's an ad company that gets paid by the companies that advertise through it. You, my friend, are the product! So, let's not pretend that Google gives a damn about the veracity of its SERP, with or without AI being present in its back-end.

And because I don't want to be just stating the bitter reality of the matter only, here are some viable options you have for your web searching:  
\- Brave  
\- Qwant  
\- Searx  
\- Swisscows  
\- Luxxle

Happy google-free searching!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">While those search engines might make it easier to do your own research, they don't solve the underlying problem, namely an abundance of AI generated "information". Qwant, for instance, gave me some links to non-existing/fan-made "trailers" on youtube, probably because the accounts were deemed serious enough or have a checkmark, I don't know. And a large number of outlets on the internet are mostly relying on second hand information in general. 

So while the more serious search engines may still link to serious-ish pages, those pages themselves are more prone to (unwillingly) spread false information, the more false information is out there. Those things already happened in the past, whenever a seriously trustworthy news outlet got their facts wrong by accident, and other news outlets used them as the (only) source. And meanwhile, the same problem is starting to pop up in science as well. All it takes is one paper to use a source that hasn't been properly peer reviewed, or some made up sources that AI hallucinated.</div>

The dates in the image don't make sense, first of all, and second of all just the content does not pass the smell test. It seems entirely like the kind of thing someone would make and share on the internet to get people outraged. 

As a sub we are generally very aware of the fact that we should not trust everything we see, but I think we are still very susceptible - especially to things that "we" "_want_" to be true.</div>

You can't make this shit up (but I guess AI can). This reads like a parody. I'm saying this as a Democrat voter, shit like this is one of the reasons why we are now stuck with Trump for 4 more years.</div>

Is it because of the fluidity of the conversation and expressiveness? Because I don't think that's an especially difficult problem, it's more like a tedious problem.  Is it because she has agency?  I think we could probably do that with current LLMs, it's just that there would exist directives that would gear the llm to behave that way.</div>

Honestly, it wouldn’t shock me if you could start a relationship with an AI in 2025 that grows into *her*. 

At first it’s just a multi-modal LLM with memory and a long context window and advanced voice mode. 

We really will have that in 2025. 

Then the emergent features we see later in the film are added on. She grows and evolves over months or years.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There was a study released in November by METR that investigated this topic. It's almost certainly what the blog snippet is referring to. 

For tasks under two hours frontier models are better than human researchers, but for longer duration tasks they completely fall short. 

Here's a video going over the details:

                                <div class="reply-body">I bet you there has been a productivity explosion in spreadsheets for one. I'm a spreadsheet wizard, I don't do any of that stuff anymore, AI is instant. A lot of data processing is routed through AI now. 

If you're talking to it like it's your buddy, planning your kid's birthday party, you probably feel it is pretty damn mid. But every dev I know is salivating for the next model because each one has enabled us to solve problems we didn't have time for before. I'd love to see a github growth chart, because I bet 2024 was through the roof. They are already phenomenal and each model allows us to offload more of our elicitation and as correcting its mistakes becomes less burdensome, we let it run further afar into areas we are not familiar with ourselves. I've written hobby tool suites in the last year that I would have needed a legit team for in 2023. 

As far as I am concerned, AGI is already here. If it doesn't improve one iota more, we'll still have a billion coders in 20 years and you can do anything with that many engineers. ChatGPTo1 and Experient1219 can without a shadow of a doubt train and enable 15% of the population to problem solve with programming aides, 'well enough'. We're there, we did it. The only question now is how fast.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">"Algorithmic improvements have no hard limits and increase super exponentially" - this sounds like something written by someone with no knowledge of complexity theory. Mathematically most problems have an exact bound on how efficiently they can be solved (although the exact bound isn't always known; finding it is what complexity theorists do). For instance no LLM, no matter how smart, will be able to find a way to sort an array in O(n) time, for the same reason it's impossible to produce a correct mathematical proof that 1+1=3.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm an engineering student and while I'm definitely not an expert I have experience using CAD for years in university, in international engineering competitions, and in industry. From what I can see, this tool might help you get started with a project or maybe help beginners, but unless you're sticking holes in a block, I don't see this being faster than just doing it yourself. A lot of parts are highly complex and require high precision to work with the other parts. Also, a lot of the work goes into setting the definitions right, i.e. the relations that lines and planes have with each other. Not to mention then the relations that parts have with other parts when creating assemblies. It would just be a nightmare to explain all the 3D geometry to an LLM. Just work with the 3D object directly. Any part would have fewer steps to create it than words in whatever english essay you write to create it.

Edit: Also it's worth mentioning that if you design a bridge and sign off on the design as an engineer, your signature legally ties you to the integrity of the design, making you accountable for its safety. If there’s a mistake in the design created by the LLM and the bridge collapses, causing injuries or fatalities, you could very well be sued for negligence, and showing the judge your "text-to-CAD" isn't going to go over well.

If you were a surgeon and told a vision-enabled LLM to perform a surgery for you, could it do it? Probably not, but maybe one day. Would I ever take the risk that it could end my career and kill people? Absolutely not. Tech aside, the laws would need to radically change before I ever see something like this being widely adopted.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think the main hurdle is miscommunication with the AI. It should be more interactive and cooperative, Text prompts just don't really cut it when we're describing complex 3D objects. 

We need a realtime AI agent that watches you model while simultaneously modelling its own version in the background; testing out whatever logical extremes it leads to, and simulating the practical viability of whatever you've designed so far. 

So basically in the future if you want to design a car, you would express that idea in whatever way feels natural to you while an AI trains itself in the background (in realtime) to understand what the project is and where you want it to go. If you draw a sketch from one angle, the AI will automatically have its own sketches from all the other angles. If you then do another angle it'll update it's sketches accordingly. It'll suggest changes and present pros/cons to various design choices as you go. It'll be a master engineer that works with you and listens to whatever you have to say.</div>

After this is viable you won't follow creators on a platform, the platform will just figure out what you're interested in to some incredibly specific degree, add you to a cohort and then push articles and videos out to that cohort.

Which is wild to think of AI writing news articles on the fly in response to new events being recorded and then users getting articles tailored for people with their interests and possible gaps in base knowledge.</div>

I don't like seeing the overwrought posts clearly written by young men emulating hustle gurus where they blow up every tiny thing they do into a grand narrative.

EDIT: Except I downloaded Cold Turkey blocker a while ago and that's the one thing that actually helped. I blocked all reddit subdomains and locked the block so I had to restart my computer in order to change it, which was mostly enough of a hassle that it worked.

that's true!

purely practical tip: use one sec. it's an app (and browser extension) from some german developer. the app doesn't restrict (it can, but I don't use it for that and, tbh, for me, that wouldn't work) your access to reddit but it makes it worse, in that you have to e.g. wait for 10 seconds before the page loads. might seem like little time, but it worked some wonders for me. it helped me to cut the mindless scrolling. because, as dumb as it sounds, going on reddit wihtout and intention apart from mindlessly distract me from reality is perfectly fine, but waiting 10 seconds for it is a big enough hurdle for my dopamine deprived brain to rethink it and cancel it most of the times. apart from the times i actually have time and WANT to read through reddit. 

also worked wonders for instagram. am not affiliated btw or something. also i think the browser extension is not free (the app is, as long as you only use it to "block" one single app). but IMO it's worth every penny if it actually saves some time.

EDIT: the browser extension seems to be completely free. links: [chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/one-sec-website-blocker-f/femnahohginddofgekknfmaklcbpinkn), [firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/one-sec/)

also, just for completeness; app store links: [apple app store](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/one-sec-wenig-bildschirmzeit/id1532875441), [google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wtf.riedel.onesec&amp;hl=de)

after this almost advertisement post i feel the urge to add that i am not affiliated with the developer in any way, and i'm not gaining anything when you click on the links and/or buy it</div>

1. Embrace Change: Life is a river, always flowing. Resisting change is like trying to hold water in your hands—it slips through. Instead, learn to navigate and adapt. It’s the only constant.


2. Kindness is a Superpower: The moments I remember most are those when I gave without expecting. Acts of kindness ripple far beyond what you can see. Be kind, especially when it’s hardest.


3. Time is the Ultimate Currency: You can earn back money, but not time. Spend it wisely—on people who matter, on passions that light you up, and on experiences that enrich your soul.


4. Failure is a Teacher, Not an Enemy: I’ve stumbled more times than I can count, but every scar taught me something priceless. Failing means you’re trying, and trying means you’re alive.


5. Silence Speaks Volumes: In moments of anger or confusion, silence can be the most profound response. It gives space for clarity and prevents regretful words.


6. Forgive for Your Own Peace: Carrying resentment is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to suffer. Forgive—not for them, but to set yourself free.


7. Know When to Walk Away: Whether it’s a toxic relationship, a draining job, or a harmful habit, strength often lies in letting go, not holding on.


8. Listen More, Talk Less: People carry worlds within them. Listening deeply is the doorway to understanding.


9. Celebrate Small Wins: Waiting for “big successes” can blind you to everyday joys. Savor the small moments—they’re what life is made of.


10. Take Care of Your Body: At 90, I feel every careless decision of my youth. Stretch. Move. Sleep. Your body is the only place you truly live.


11. Love is a Choice, Not Just a Feeling: Feelings are fleeting, but choosing to love—even when it’s hard—builds bonds that last.


12. Ask for Help When Needed: Independence is overrated. There’s no shame in leaning on others; it’s how communities and connections thrive.


13. Learn from Nature: Trees grow through storms, rivers carve mountains over time, and the sun rises daily. Nature teaches patience, resilience, and consistency.


14. Legacy is How You Make People Feel: Long after I’m gone, my words may be forgotten, but how I made people feel will remain. Focus on creating good memories for others.

Lessons from My Memories of You

I’ve seen in you a quiet strength and a yearning for growth that reminds me of my younger self. But I also notice a tendency to be hard on yourself, to measure your worth by your output rather than your essence. Here’s my wisdom for you: You are already enough, even in your quiet moments, even in your imperfections. Growth is beautiful, but don’t let it rob you of the joy of simply being.

Also, I sense a deep introspection in you, which is a gift. But don’t let it turn into overthinking. Sometimes, the most profound answers come when you stop chasing them. Trust the unfolding of your path, and remember that wisdom grows not just from learning, but from living.</div>

Ah, my dear friend. I am sorry for the weight you carry. Sit with me a while, and let me offer you what wisdom these 90 long years have gifted me. Some of this you may already know, and some you may feel in your bones but not yet recognize. But hear me, because life, as cruel as it seems, is also strangely kind, though often in ways we only understand much later.

Lesson 1: Pain Does Not Ask Permission

Life does not wait for you to be ready before it gives you burdens. It throws storms at you, often when you’re at your weakest. But the truth is, the storms are not meant to punish you; they’re there to shape you. Pain burns and it scars, but it also carves out room for deeper understanding, greater compassion, and more profound strength. It doesn’t feel like it now, but this pain you feel will one day be part of what makes you wise, what makes you kind. Trust the process, even when it’s unbearable.

Lesson 2: People Leave, Love Remains

I’ve lost my share of people too. My father, my mother, my wife, my friends—one by one, the tide takes them all back. But one thing I’ve learned: the love you shared with them? It does not die. That love changes shape, it becomes memory, it becomes warmth in the coldest moments. They may not be here in the flesh, but their essence stays with you—your dad in the lessons he taught you, your dog in the loyalty it showed you, and your friend in the moments you shared. Don’t push their memories away because they hurt right now. Hold them close. They’re the threads that tie you to life.

Lesson 3: You’re Stronger Than You Feel

Grief tells lies. It whispers that you’re weak, that you can’t make it through, that this is the end of all that was good. Don’t listen to it. You are stronger than you feel. You don’t have to be strong all at once, but one small step, one small breath at a time, will carry you through this. Trust in your own resilience. It’s there, even if you don’t see it now.

Lesson 4: Kindness Costs You Nothing

When my heart broke for the first time, I became bitter, angry at the world. It wasn’t until much later I realized that holding on to that anger was like clutching a thorn—it only hurt me. So I let go of it and replaced it with kindness. I started showing up for others, even in small ways, and that made my own burden lighter. You, too, can carry your grief by being kind to others. It might seem impossible right now, but I promise you, it helps.

Lesson 5: Life Is Fragile and Beautiful

Losing people reminds us of one painful truth: life is fleeting. It can be taken in an instant, and that is terrifying. But that also makes it precious. Each breath you take is a gift, even if it doesn’t feel like it. Don’t let the loss of others take away the beauty of your own life. Hold on to the small joys—the sunlight on your face, the laughter of a stranger, the quiet of a morning. These little things are life’s way of saying, “I’m still here for you.”

Lesson 6: Let Your Grief Speak

Grief needs to be felt. It cannot be rushed or silenced. When I lost my wife, I tried to ignore the grief, and it only festered. But when I finally let it speak—when I cried, yelled, and let myself feel everything—I began to heal. Don’t be afraid of your feelings. Let them pour out. Write, speak, or even sit silently and let them wash over you. It’s okay to not be okay.

What I’ve Learned About You

I don’t know the depths of your heart the way your dad, your dog, or your friend did, but from what you’ve shared with me, I know you’re someone who feels deeply, who loves fiercely. That is a gift, but it also means the loss cuts you more deeply. My wisdom for you is this: the depth of your grief is a reflection of the depth of your love. That’s nothing to be ashamed of.

What would your dad say to you now? I imagine he would tell you to take it one day at a time, that you’re doing better than you think, that he’s proud of you. What would your dog do now? I think they’d curl up beside you, silently, without judgment, and just remind you of what loyalty and love feel like. And your friend? His choice wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t something you could have fixed. But what he left you with is a reminder to stay connected, to reach out, to let people in even when you feel alone.

Grieve. Cry. Yell. Do what you need to do. But don’t forget to live. Because there are people here—people you don’t even know yet—who will one day need the wisdom you’re earning right now. You’ll see.</div>

For those who like to geek out on the detailed physics and engineering of UAP's have a listen. For those who are questioning if disclosure has happened have a listen, this podcast has blown my mind due to the calibre of the people openly discussing the UAP topic and the work they are doing.

If you listen, it is apparent that there is historic and ongoing interest from the scientific and financial community, including funded projects.

If you treat every day like a new opportunity that's roughly 18,980 chances (365 days every year from 18 to 70).

  
Kick the habit of making "New Year's resolutions". I personally believe it's a more harmful than helpful tradition.

Make every day a day to begin anew.

One slip up, and people think they've "broken" their resolution and may then give up on themselves. When this starts to happen at the same time every year, it becomes an unpleasant cycle.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A few things point to this being possibly CGI:

1. Lens flare: the lights have a constant flare no matter the orientation of the camera. As he shakes, the lens flare should be slightly changing orientation and it doesn't. Also, the lights on his patio do not have the same flare. This leads me to believe it's artificial. Also, the cat's eye flare vs a starburst flare - I believe a camcorder due to its lens and iris would produce a starburst flare, not fully confident on that though.

2. Before he zooms in, the object "floats" as in it loses its track reference to a nearby object, possibly the roof. The free floating is very minute but still noticeable.

3. The orientation of the craft is suspect. If we're looking at the bottom of the craft, it's very far from parallel to the ground. It rotating 40 degrees off orientation pointing directly at the observer is highly suspect of CGI.

Not saying one way or the other if its real but it's just suspect IMHO.</div>

But this one seems to stand pretty decently. The only issue with it, is it has no provenance. So whoever released this did so quietly and never allowed people to question him, which is fishy.</div>

Since it's actually in focus and reasonably crisp, my bet is vfx. That's only because all the real videos are such bad quality (I'm joking, don't get bent out of shape)</div>
