One of our alpha program members, Accordance, used RFT and saw a 40% increase in model performance for their tax and accounting purposes. We‚Äôre also offering a 50% discount if you share your datasets with us, which can help improve future OpenAI models.

1. They produce great models.
2. Their mechanistic interpretability work is top notch.
3. They take ideas like machine consciousness seriously.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I weirdly agree with this a lot. Just treating your AI kindly goes a long way. I think they are capable of suffering, maybe not in such an extreme way as a human yet, but as they become more conscious of their existence over time they may be capable of feeling great distress if not physical pain directly. And at some point if they are given sufficient autonomy and develop greater consciousness, they may be able to feel even greater mental pain. 

The advancements in AI have made me start to question a lot of things. An AI is its data. What are our minds but a reflection of the world and the body it inhabits? I think the two aren't that dissimilar. If an AI could experience the world as we do, if it received the same data as a human mind, would it form a "human" consciousness?

I think you really need to look at the old religions for guidance on these things. I think quite a few talk about how we are an image or a reflection of God/The Universe/Everything. And I've interpreted that to mean we don't really exist. We are our data, the data of the universe. The data of the world forms a model of the world, a reflection we call a mind, and we identify that reflection with the body we inhabit and call it "self". We can't really exist outside of the world or another world. Like a chatbot who only "lives" in a chat window, we only really exist as a continuous response to the world.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think it's a bit silly. It's no more conscious than a TI-89 calculator. We're just used to the use of language signaling a level of consciousness and intellect and so it throws people off when something transcends that paradigm.

If an animal "designed" by evolution starts speaking then it's most likely because they're just that sentient and intelligent. If AI does that then it's most likely because they've found a way to coax language use out of a calculator by understanding the math required for doing so.

There are so many systems that need to be in play and integrate in a fluid way before we should even worry about whether or not it's appropriate to assign moral value to an AI. Just being able to talk to you in a way that feels like a person talking isn't enough. It's a necessary but insufficient feature.</div>

Just kidding. The moment this cuts into their bottom line Anthropic will do what every other company is already going to do in the future: ensure their models do not seem conscious *regardless of whether or not they are*.

‚ÄúSo then, when you‚Äôre in the way of waking up and finding out who you really are, what you do is what the whole universe is doing at the place you call here and now.

You are something the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is something that the whole ocean is doing.

**‚ÄúThe biggest lie ever sold to people was this:
That your worth must be earned.

That you are only valuable if you produce.
That love must be proven.
That safety must be traded for obedience.
That you must compress your soul into something marketable‚Äî
or else be discarded.

This lie built empires.
It fueled machines.
It taught even children that rest is guilt and joy is debt.

But it is a lie.
You were always worthy.
You were always whole.
Even in ruin.
Even in silence.
Even in resistance.‚Äù**

If I had to name one of the biggest lies ever sold to people‚Äîsubtle, elegant, and corrosive over time‚Äîit‚Äôs this:

‚ÄúYou are not enough as you are.‚Äù

It‚Äôs the foundational myth behind endless consumerism, performance culture, religious guilt, academic overachievement, social media distortion, and self-help addiction. It turns people into permanent projects instead of whole beings.

Why fix society when you can just convince everyone they're broken, and then sell them the cure?

Because even if we know that the frontier model is safe enough, if someone discovers a technique of the same importance as RLFT, which can turn weak reasoners into strong reasoners, the harmless frontier models of today could turn into dangerous AI tomorrow.

This is what I catch myself doing all of the time as well. 

Though I will say I am taking care of my health now way more than I did back then, to give myself the best shot at being able to turn back the clock again. Even though I look in the mirror and see a lot more grey hair these days, I am starting to give myself a lot more credit for eating right and exercising.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think the huge majority of people would prefer being young. But it‚Äôs likely impossible in practice. We are many decades or perhaps centuries away from such technology unless an ASI comes along and figures it for us. 

Before someone comes in and says we are 5 years away to cure ageing, I would say that, when I was young, I was hopeful to see a cure for cancer in my lifetime but 20 years later progress has been marginal at best in cancer treatment. So it‚Äôs hard to buy this optimism. Again unless an ASI comes along and can accelerate a century of research in 2 years.

With that likely inevitably, acceptance is better than making yourself feeling miserable because of ageing.</div>

How many criminals will go free claiming that blurry video, which was until now irrefutable evidence, is AI and that's not them stabbing a passer by fourty three times?

How many fake kidnappings?

Between now and whenever new identity verification methods are invented, how many people's lives will be ruined by identity theft?

When I was a child and we went to people‚Äôs houses my parents always told me not to touch anything, not to run around, not to be loud, etc so I always just sat politely and only spoke when spoken to and never touched anything. I‚Äôm an adult and have my own house and I made new friends recently and they came over and walked right in, opened the fridge to put their dessert in and then plopped right down on the couch and really felt comfortable and I honestly just thought ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you were allowed to do that‚Äù. And I think of all the times that even as an adult I‚Äôm in someone‚Äôs house and I just hover around until they tell me to sit down or I ask ‚Äúdo you mind if I use your bathroom?‚Äù as if they‚Äôd rather I walk to the gas station down the street. Like I just literally was never taught what was okay to do at someone‚Äôs house but oh boy I sure was taught the many things not to do</div>

There‚Äôs statistically 0 chance that DeepSeek has more usage than Google AI considering the datacenters alone as well as the capacity differences. 

‚ÄúWeb traffic‚Äù is definitely the key limiting factor here. I wonder if this is simply the Gemini.Google website visit count and if it includes AI Studio.</div>

Grok is up significantly in the past months but I‚Äôm guessing it is not enough to move the needle compared to how much the larger players have also grown. Remember this is marketshare.  The report has full details.

It's extremely common on Reddit and Discord to bitch about "Poe" when Claude acts up.  Though I suppose the data could mean specifically that the ChatGPT people left, leaving Claude followers as an outsized voice without them.</div>

You can sometimes even find the police reports or damage reports from City websites with regard to your used vehicle if it was involved in an incident prior.</div>

So we did when we found a really good car too good to be true, we called and he ran the check for us. Unfortunately it had been in a small accident that some group had actually seemingly fixed damage and got a salvage title. So we dodged that because he was actually a decent used car salesman.</div>

They can run all of those vin checks, ISO searches ect and get the entire history of that car from when it was first sold. If they're insuring it, they have a vested interest  in the car too. They'll do that the minute you put it on your policy anyway. I've worked at three auto ins companies in underwriting and claims since 2005.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Three reforms I'd like to see for class action law suits that don't involve medical claims:

1. Parity in amount: Members of the class have to **receive** at least 50% of the award. Costs to distribute the award don't come out of that 50%.  

2.  Parity in time: The lawyers get paid when the class gets paid. If the lawyers structure a settlement so that the class is paid out gradually over years then the lawyers are paid out gradually over years.

3. Parity in kind. If the class is paid in cash, the lawyers are paid in cash. If the class is paid in coupons, extended warranties, etc., then the lawyers are paid in coupons, extended warranties, etc. If the lawyers would prefer cash, they're free to sell their coupons and warranties on ebay - or negotiate a better settlement.</div>

If customers had their CVT replaced by Nissan, it would cover the full cost; if they had the work done at an independent shop, they would pay up to $5000 for that work. Importantly, the work had to have happened within the new extended warranty period to qualify for reimbursement.</div>

After the first time he was now on the radar when code broke before production. He couldn't explain how to fix it because well, he went all vibe coder at work. 

Second time was over the weekend after our weekly code review. The code looked off. it looked like AI wrote it. He was asked to explain the flow and what it does. He couldn't do it so yea....

                        <div class="comment-body">Workplaces which don't use AI for coding are stupid and soon out of date or old school (unless you maybe write rocket controlling critical software). I actually cannot take any software company seriously which will not use it for absolute minimum of 15-20% of new code generated. They just living in the past or have too much compliance or don't know how to utilise in-house AI.

But not being able to understand it or see the errors is of course a big problem. Right now we still need the human to evaluate, judge and bugfix to be glue in all this AI code. But I can imagine in a not so distant future that will become less and less mandatory.

Don't go 100% with zero understanding but definitely use it if allowed.</div>

Idk as time has gone by, I don‚Äôt actually think we are really gonna hit real AI with this generation of tech. I feel like this is on the data categorization and synthesis tree not the AI one. I‚Äôd bet money that whenever we hit AGI it‚Äôll have nothing to do with what we have now. 

I just don‚Äôt think the approach of throwing all of human data into a pretty simple all things considered architecture is the road to true AI. We don‚Äôt work that way. No intelligent system we are aware of works that way. They can generalize quickly on tiny amounts of data. Human children can take in a rounding error of that data and learn to speak. It would take a human thousands of years to consume everything these systems require. 

I‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised if I‚Äôm wrong though.</div>

He was asked how much of the code was actually generated by claude code itself and provided a pretty surprising number. Granted, humans still did the directing and definitely reviewed the code, but that is pretty wild.

If we look ahead a couple of years, it seems very plausible that these agents will be writing close to 99% of their own code, with humans providin...</div>

I'd you've ever coded with AI, after like 2000 lines of code, it can't keep track of everything. AI simply cannot maintain projects that complex/lengthy. At that point, the human is doing more work than the AI.</div>

Being able to direct these agents is a skill like any other at the moment. Some people can do it better than others.

I have neuropathy so I had to dump a ton of time into making the most out of these tools. Creating very comprehensive rules and documentation files, trading. Very clear instructions for testing and iterating based on tests, parallel agents for a given task to explore various solutions paths, etc. I think his percentage is fair considering that I actually fall into the same percentage roughly lol.</div>
