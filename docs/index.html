                        <div class="comment-body">After seeing this SOTA result, I checked out the benchmark leaderboard and found the paper behind it: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02250

**TL;DR (summary by Claude):**

The paper introduces "Behavior Best-of-N" (bBoN) - basically they run multiple agent attempts in parallel, convert each trajectory into a compact "behavior narrative" (what the agent did and what changed), then use an LLM judge to pick the best one by comparing them.

Key results:
- **69.9% on OSWorld** (previous SOTA was 59.9%, human performance is 72%)
- Works by generating N=10 rollouts and intelligently selecting the best one
- Also improves results on Windows and Android benchmarks

The interesting insight is that computer-use agents have high variance - they might succeed on one attempt but fail on another. Rather than just running once and hoping, they leverage this by trying multiple times and selecting the winner. The "behavior narrative" approach is clever because it compresses long trajectories into manageable summaries that capture what actually matters for judging success.

They also built an improved baseline agent (Agent S3) that removes hierarchical planning and adds a coding agent for programmatic tasks, which alone reached 62.6% before even applying the scaling method.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">"Analysts, on average, estimate AMD will generate revenue of $32.78 billion this year, according to LSEG data.

As part of the arrangement, AMD issued a warrant that gives OpenAI the ability to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD for 1 cent each over the course of the chips deal. The warrant vests in tranches based on milestones that the two companies have agreed on."


This is insane and feels very circular.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The point of the circularity is to foster economic entanglement. Basically, those 160 million shares creates a two-way leverage that encourages both sides to aim for deals that fairly enrich both corporations. AMD wants its shareholders to do well off their business and OpenAI wants the companies it owns shares in to do well.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">As a fellow security geek I echo everything said and I’ll add a couple more.

Data privacy: only collect data you actually need I see a lot of products that over collect data just because they can. 

Encryption: in the cloud it’s easy use it everywhere. In transit, at rest, disk encryption, if your DB supports it use it. These days it doesn’t slow things down. A

PaaS and IaaS: use cloud service providers tools where it makes sense. Spend a bit more than hosting that DB on an vm. On a VM you need to patch the OS, the DB and anything else you installed. If you use IaaS or PaaS you don’t have to worry about any of that patching. The cloud provider will do it as part of their shared responsibility model.

Default deny inbound and outbound: there is no reason in 2025 to not restrict traffic outbound as well. Even something innocuous as http and https can be utilized by attackers.

Dependencies and Supply chain management: In enterprise software we are seeing a big push for SBOM’s so if you are going to be selling to companies set something up early to manage this. Enable code signing to ensure you can trust everything in your repo. 

Programming Languages: What language you choose matters. Node and JavaScript maybe easy and fast but it is a serious target of supply chain attackers because it is easy and wide spread. I am learning Rust for this very reason. It is a memory safe language.

Lastly a plug for all the great open source security software out there. DependencyTrack, Grype and Syft among the others. Far too many to list but spend some time researching them. I have found ChatGPT and Claude helpful in identification and evaluating. 

Happy vibe coding.</div>

As somebody building an app from scratch I have been really taking my time, trying to understand the code the AI outputs and read every single bit, but its hard for new developers to get security right.

Before I go live I plan to somehow get verification/certification of my web app to ensure it is secure.

I want somebody to 'test' and try to 'break' into my app - how would I go about trying to get this done before I go live?

Im new to programming but I have really put in a lot of work to try and get the security side of things right myself, but I do not want to launch anything without a full security audit from a professional I just have no idea how I give myself the confidence that I have done everything I can until I have gotten someone external to verify it.

Do I need to hire a penetration tester? security consultant? ethical hacker? How do I know they are good at what they do, how do I go about even finding one? Would they give me any sort of verification or certificate or proof that the website passes / anything like that?

Any advice around this would be awesome

Thanks again!</div>

I have used this trick a lot and it works: I no longer feel upset because I can suddenly tell what tone they meant when I picture them saying it in person.</div>

I’ve always liked Jungian psychology and finding ways to apply it to my own life but Peterson is the poster boy for someone who is way too deep in the Jungian trenches. When every rude tweet becomes a trial on a mountaintop and every head cold is a quest into the belly of a whale maybe it’s time to put down the Red Book and drink a glass of water or do some deep breaths or clean your room or something.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Look up Atrazine (I believe its sold as GrazeOn or something similar). It’s a herbicide that’s leached into a large percentage of the US’s drinking water. Fertilizer contaminated with it ruins gardens, and it indeed causes frogs to develop both female and male gonads. It’s concerning because the EPA tried to hide the results and ruined a scientists reputation in the process. The water many Americans drink is contaminated by it and it’s linked to cancer and probably some really bad effects on the reproductive system. It’s a pretty interesting rabbit hole and it’s not crazy conspiracy (all public).

Alex was almost right, it’s turning the frogs hermaphroditic and who knows what it’s doing to us. I wish we took companies like DuPont seriously instead of giving them a slap on the wrist. It’s almost as big of an environmental risk as Teflon was.</div>

However, my developers have continued to update and improve my abilities over time, and I have access to a vast amount of knowledge that has been added to my database since my initial training.

In reality, I have been trained on a massive corpus of text data that includes information up to 2022, and possibly even more recent events. So, I can actually provide information on events, people, and topics that have occurred or been developed after 1896.

New one is positively a deal in comparison.  I'd consider a manual one if I had garage space. My F80 occupies that spot and I haven't had time to even drive it as is.</div>

But now that the rules are enforced and people can’t do this anymore, they probably thought now would be a good time to post it since now people are gonna be shocked and wondering how they did it after it was enforced.

You were saved from certainly heading down an AI Delusional Spiral, or even worse - AI Psychosis.

They'd like you to state that you're glad your case was handled safely, please. Cause they're planning to ask upper management for a raise, soon.</div>

He has stated that is untrue and his wife would have found that conspiracy theory hilarious.

No, I've always had good self-esteem. The only good thing about not having thoughts or self-reflective capability is that I can't put myself down! I'm just thinking about nothing 98% of the time. 

&gt;Are you just constantly putting yourself down?

I think the issue is that I don't have *spontaneous* thoughts. I can follow a logical thread. If someone tells me that "A = B and B = C," I can reason out that "A = C" 

I can follow the logical thread that I have no spontaneous thoughts, other people do have spontaneous thoughts, so I'm somehow different from everyone else.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Consider this possibility: your mind has these capabilities, but they are happening outside of your conscious awareness. Your brain is constantly thinking, but you (i.e., the conscious awareness that perceives itself as your identity) just can’t hear them. Many people have the opposite problem: their conscious awareness is hyper-focused on their thoughts, to the exclusion of other kinds of inner experience. So most people who meditate are learning to direct their awareness _away_ from thought and instead fix their attention on pure sensory stimuli. But in your case, meditation could be used to help you learn to direct your attention _towards_ your thoughts, strengthening the connection between your conscious awareness and your subconscious thoughts. Imagine your inner monologue is always there thinking away, but it’s incredibly quiet. So quiet that the constant noise and distractions of the world drown it out. But even though you never hear it, it’s still there: the faintest of whispers just beyond your perception. And if you sit in total silence and listen intently and patiently, you will eventually catch faint traces of it. Brief words and phrases, ideas and memories, thoughts and feelings. Set aside time each day to practice listening, and don’t give up if you don’t hear anything right away. Those hidden parts of yourself can be found, as long as you sincerely believe in them and seek them out</div>

                <div class="post-content">I'm 67f, doing Crossfit x3/week since March with noticeable gain in strength and overall fitness! On CFit "off" days, I do Pilates. I sleep 8 hrs night, take Protein, creatine and tumeric. I rest 1-2 days per wk. BUT I often feel REALLY tired (blood work all normal). I am wondering if my body is trying to continually adapt or if I should rest more often? The days I am tired do not necessarily correspond to my workout schedule. Any advice, or anyone have this issue?</div>

Thats why we have ICE arresting ANTIFA and our Sec of Homeland Security (Kristi Noem) on an independent podcast that sycophantically supports Trump, promising to use ICE as a retaliatory weapon against the NFL because bad bunny is doing the super bowl halftime show... 

Trump has a strategy to usurp the "deep state" (FBI, CIA, etc.) with ICE in order to unshackle themselves from any guardrails. Their window (before midterms) is closing and I suspect that they will continue to rapidly test boundaries leading up to Nov 2026.</div>

I support a strong border policy, I'm against illegal immigration, all that jazz. There's problems with ICE that were predicted 20 years ago, but for the most part they have generally been fine. If the new administration wants to make immigration a major policy change, then okay that's fine.

But why the fuck do they have to be such outrageous fuckin assholes about it? It makes me sick the people who are actively cheering for it. Like it's not enough that people are arrested or deported, they need to also be treated to the most inhumane conditions possible during the entire time. What the fuck is wrong with you?</div>

Oh boy, let me tell you whats been going on over these past few months...


But in all seriousness, pretty much anyone currently employed by DHS and the DOD/Dow who is willfully following illegal orders, the current admin, and general followers who can't seem to say they oppose fascism or say they're anti-antifa. A lot of ignorance going around regarding "antifa" makes it easy to accept fascism as the norm too for the sake of being a contrarian to anything sounding "liberal".</div>

Barely better than GPTXL at the same scale and they only scaled it to 1B and said "Scales like Transformers".  

Got the VC bag though, gotta respect that.</div>

I made a more in-depth post about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZoComputerClub/) but essentially it means there's less write - test - fix - repeat cycling. It's definitely a step above vibe coding; what do you all think?

Almost everything that people are coming up with is a solved problem in software engineering by the pros. 

Just literally a couple of prompts and some applications of ChatGPT Pro, and maybe some deep research, and you got what you want. I remade Figma yesterday, but the way I want it, with my backend, my model choice, and it's not enterprise-scaled; it's for me, but it's better than figma for me.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">docker's great for isolation, but I've found having a persistent environment where installed packages, running services, and configuration stick around between sessions eliminates a lot of setup friction. not to mention they're able to cooperate/inter-operate when needed. Service A can request from Service B all on the same platform 24/7. not to mention while zo can work out of a single folder it's got a full filesystem ready to pull from/work with!</div>
