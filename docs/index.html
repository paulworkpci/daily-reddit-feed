https://archive.is/F9FSe#selection-991.374-991.583

From The Atlantic article. The fact that he has the gall to say this while also naming active intelligence personal over an insecure app on a personal device should be grounds for immediate firing, but this is what it looks like when a primary philosophy of 'never admit a mistake' turns into a governing principle. Shit is an embarrassment.</div>

Sam seems to have opted for very little censorship, but it looks like this may not be permanent.

Photorealistic fake images of celebrities/politicians are already easy to make, and better than most people think. 

I suppose gpt-4o image gen might be even MORE easy and better, but I mean, Midjourney was churning out images like this over 2 years ago.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I suggest reading up on constructivism, particularly social constructivism. 

We, as society, decide what is and isn’t acceptable. I grew up in the 80s/90s in the Netherlands and topless sunbathing was the norm, not the exception, fast forward 30 years and it seems to be completely taboo there. 

Our shared agreement (social constructivism) has shifted. Which means it can (and will) shift again.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">From NL as well. And thats a good observation. 

My first instinct is the availability of cameras heavily going up. As well as social media consequences for having nude or semi-nude pictures.

I remember especially early days of facebook and hives that people got fired because they had bikini pics on social media.

I have no clue how right or wrong I am but that is my first thought.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Many athletes imagine their competition outworking them. It makes them work harder.

This technique didn't really work for me. Well, not until I made this slight modification \[let me explain\].

If my competition is hustling 16 hours a day....I don't feel motivated/inspired. It's pointless.

BUT, I tweaked the question. I ask myself, "**If my competition had 15 minutes of free-time, how would they spend that time?**" Are they doing a quick work-out set? Reading? Cleaning up their room?

15 minu...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’ve seen a huge increase in (highly upvoted) snarky and annoyed comments along the lines of “bro I’m not gonna read that whole thing but here’s what I think..” on Reddit, usually in response to posts or comments even shorter than yours. It’s concerning.

Especially for a place like Reddit, which is *a discussion board* (on top of a link aggregator). 

People genuinely can’t, or can’t be bothered to read more than a paragraph anymore, no wonder most people haven’t read a book in years..

But as for your main point, same. It sucks because I’m an artist and I rely on social media and Reddit as platforms to share and promote my work (and make money). I can’t just delete them, though I’ve set up app blocks through Opal (many other apps like it, that’s just what I use) to slowly get to the point where I only use them for a few minutes a day when I need to post or respond to comments.

Thankfully I don’t have an issue with staying attentive in conversations for the most part, but i reeeeally struggle with doomscrolling :|</div>

I’m trying to build a solid morning habit that sets the tone for the day, something that keeps energy and focus high even when the schedule is stacked.

What’s *that one* habit or hack that’s been a game-changer for you?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Few things I learned and continually have to remind myself:

- tomorrow starts today. At the end of the workday, write out the things you want to work on tomorrow so your mental plate is cleaned and you can fully check out for the day.

- In the same realm as cleaning your plate,  close out all windows on your computer so you start with a fresh slate in the morning, instead of a bunch of windows open that you might not get back to right away. 

- pay attention to your ultradian rhythm and your most creative/productive hours and use those for deep work and thinking tasks. Mine are 10am-1pm where I can just “flow”.

ALWAYS have something to write on nearby. I would write my to-do list every morning as well as any issues to work on from the staff. I write down who to follow up on, my bigger on-going projects, regular day to day reminders too. Make sure your desk is reeaaally clean your work space. I would take me a good 10 to get all packed up and “reset” my desk.

1) come in a little earlier before any messages bombard you and use that time for your deep focus. 
2) but also 1 b) create a short list the night before of the top 3 things you’ll complete. No more than 3 because you want to keep focus and get things done!
3) burnout is a real thing take care of yourself first
4) get support from your boss, product owners, team
5) delegate delegate delegate! You’re a new manager now your role is no longer an IC</div>

She gives off the worst vibes and it's frustrating that no one else sees this. Reminds me of Ariana Grande too, yet no one is talking about it!!

The weirdest thing about this is the lack of hate for this girl. Every celeb has popular snark pages, and you'll be able to find people criticizing them pretty quickly if you search for it. This girl? Literally not a single piece of (mainstream) criticism. </div>

Example:
We have Samsara cameras now in 
company vehicles which is an AI tattletale device that watches you and reports back to your employer about every little thing...it thought me eating a chocolate pop tart was me holding a cell phone. Silly...

I am just frustrated I suppose. I miss the old days...</div>

It will yell at you if your eyes aren't perfectly forward for more than three seconds. It will yell at you if you don't have enough space in front, even in traffic jams where everyone will dart in front if they can. It is like being micromanaged by a literal retard.


The worst one I heard about was with a trucking company. One of the routes had a traffic light that would go from green to red in half a second. The driver would hit his brakes to avoid an accident. Stupid HR only sees the braking on his score, and tells him that if he doesn't stop then he's going to get fired. So... He runs red lights in order to keep his job.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Maybe this will be downvoted to oblivion because AARO BAD but it almost sounds like Kosloski is actively trying to find aliens.

A lot of the article is about data science stuff. Gathering as much data as possible, developing and deploying sensors, scraping vast databases of military imagery etc. There is some stuff about resolving cases and yes they say they havn't found any definitive proof yet but it kinda feels like that's what they're after.

Almost like a government Gallileo project.

One can speculate on the reasons of course. Legitimate attempt to identify emerging threats (even if not extraterrestrial) or maybe Kosloski is just a data nerd and searching through petabtytes of data to find anomalies itches his scratch.

My conspiracy minded brain tells me the gatekeepers know the jig is up so they want Kosloski to find proof and present it to the world that doesn't involve them opening the warehouses. That way they can be all surprised pikachu when the truth comes out and be all like "Aliens!? Who knew?" while sweeping the last 70 years of shady shit under the carpet.

It certainly doesn't feel like they're trying to keep a lid on it, or at the least that Kosloski himself is read in.

But perhaps that's just my perception being managed lol.</div>

I had back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, migraines, and my legs were always sore when I woke up. Thought I had something else going on, nope! Just a shitty mattress.</div>

A lot of people still don’t know that credible and urgent means that the UAP Crash Retrieval Programs exist and that they are hiding it from congress and the public, so I just wanted to share this clip again from Joe Rogan from around 8 months ago since I think it’s needed.

I'm not sure the ICIG is credible or knows what urgent means.

Hopefully with Grusch being involved with Luna's Task Force, he might be able to get somewhere, but its a long shot because clearly doing nothing is the preferred option.</div>
