TL;DR:

&gt; His research argues that the mechanism driving AI outputs is mathematically equivalent to a multi-spin thermal system — a well-studied structure in physics. 


Explanation: 

&gt;Each token in a prompt (a word or fragment) is modelled as a “spin" in a high-dimensional space. The LLM’s attention mechanism (its way of focusing on certain parts of a prompt) amounts to calculating interactions between these spins. In physics terms, it’s a two-body interaction, like gravity or magnetism.


&gt;This setup allows the authors to derive an equation predicting when a model’s output will shift, or “tip,” from good (that is, factually accurate) to bad (misleading or false). 


&gt;“The tipping point is determined from the very start," Johnson explains. “It’s hard-wired by the structure of the prompt and the model’s training."</div>

Interesting work. 

Love this quote as it shows there is hope for improvement: 

&gt;Its 2-body form suggests why LLMs work so well, but hints that a generalized 3-body Attention would make such AI work even better. Its similarity to a spin-bath means that existing Physics expertise could immediately be harnessed to help Society ensure AI is trustworthy and resilient to manipulation.</div>

We already know the FBI assigned a hundreds of employees to flag Trump’s name in the files. We know they were bffs and Trump is on video numerous times talking about his relationship with him. 

There are tons of women accusing Trump and he was elected after admitting to sexually assaulting women.

None of that scandalous material has affected him. What could possibly be in the files that the standard MAGA/FOX media couldn’t bury and obfuscate just like everything else?</div>

Adults have so much shit going on in their life- the gym doesn’t need to add to that. School pickups, meetings, traffic, the list goes on. Don’t make the gym stressful too. 
I even had an athlete who was chronically late. 

The alternative is they don’t come, and they eventually quit. You’re never late at Planet Fitness</div>

I have a crazy schedule so I like to power through the WOD and once I finish I like to put away my stuff and leave. The coach started belittling me for putting equipment away before everyone was done. I wasn’t cutting through the floor, I was being careful and going around the outside edges. At first I thought he was joking, so I kept cleaning the he walked up and was like “what did I say? When I say don’t clean up I mean don’t clean up.” I literally walked away and emailed them to cancel my membership from the car.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree - but also think it is reasonable to have a cut off time of, say, 5 minutes after class starts. It's for both the late athlete's safety, given their warm up would be shortened and they may miss announcements, but also for the others in class. It's disruptive to have to shift around, stop, have the coach repeat themselves, etc.... just because one person is late.

Same is true for a yoga class but not for safety reasons. It disrupts the class for the others that showed up on time.

But, as for not posting workouts - I totally agree. I can choose to skip workouts I don't want to do (like tomorrow's snatch workout at my gym). I also am within my right to modify as I see fit. If barbell snatches aggravate my shoulder, I'll switch to DB snatches and don't need the coach's permission.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Many people often ignore economics basics. Increasing productivity by 100% doesn't make GDP grow by 100% it also doesn't halve needed labor. The reason is that needed labor is basically infinite (best seen in research, healthcare, software development, etc.) and much of work is done in competition with others which most of the time doesn't fundamentally change the amount of consumption and generation of goods. This is imo best seen in marketing: Fashion brand A gets more productive in marketing because of AI and outcompetes brand B, but this won't necessarily increase production as the demand for clothing is basically fixed (not exactly true, but you get the point). Also after some point brand B also gets more productive so not much has changed from a economical view.

This is only the economic aspect. But it's also quite obvious that we're not there yet from a technical standpoint. I think we only will see significant layoffs when models will learn to learn to continually. Just think of your own work: Do you think that AI is able to replace you? If yes, then I am assuming to let the AI do everything for you while you are enjoying your life? ;)

  
Another perspective is this: As long as Human + AI is better than just AI then there will be incentive to keep hiring. If you don't keep hiring you're in danger to be outcompeted at some point, especially if you're not in a monopoly.</div>

Holy shit, someone who actually gets it right here, folks. 

Everyone telling you 'we need UBI' and '99% layoffs by 2030' is reasoning from a static workforce concept. 

But the human desire for goods from labor is effectively infinite. Right on.</div>

Absolutely not! If it was the case, we wouldn't have issues finding jobs ever. The needed labor IS limited and this oversight of considering it infinite is the biggest problem with capitalism. Because normal people often can only offer labor and when the demand is met, then labor is devalued, salaries drop and people suffer.</div>

First off this is just not true. This is a selling point AI companies want you to believe but it's just not manifesting in reality.  Which is exactly why they are not seeing any big booms to production since AI has been pushed into certain workplaces. They are pretty much putting out the same trajectory of output as before.</div>

That's three barriers in the way of adoption which are very present almost everywhere. Some companies are scrambling to put together education and training packages but AI is an odd tool to train people on: not high enough reliability and functions are too generic. By the time the package is ready, the tech is different. By the time the course starts, it's outdated, by the time it ends it's useless. It's a good time to be a fast learner.

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed. In software development, it's barely proving to boost productivity at all so far - one (decent) study suggested it actually slows down development. Coding speed is rarely the bottleneck in software development in any case, so there's a limit to what it can achieve there without completely taking over.

I'm trying to get better at using it - it's definitely very useful for small-to-medium-sized isolated tasks like writing scripts, creating skeletons, etc.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Pretty good question, I can give you a few glaring differences:

&gt; For example, if you use the setup VSCode + extension, you’re still manually telling the system what to do. The editor interprets commands, you run tasks, and the extension modifies files. It doesn’t “understand” why the changes are happening. While Nelima has semantic indexing and contextual lookup so agents can resolve fuzzy references into concrete files. That means embeddings, metadata tagging, and disambiguation logic on top of the FS.

&gt; There’s also the fact that files live in a folder, but nothing inherently connects them to your past runs, tasks, or prompts. If you want context, you have to manually track it (notes, comments, git history). Nelima kinda has her own memory graph. Which task created it? What prompt generated it? what updates were made? Etc... The agent can recall these connections implicitly.

&gt; Another point is also that you’re kinda playing with fire. Any extension that manipulates files is operating on your real filesystem. Mistakes can delete or overwrite critical data. While Nelima is a completely contained OS. 

But tbh, you have to see Nelima’s agentic storage as just a component of her capabilities and CRUD is just a part of the OS like system. You could theoretically host websites, run ml models (compute stuff)… You can combine + mix and match tasks with her other capabilities like web browsing, scheduling, apps etc…</div>

How are you doing updates? Is it just replacing the whole file or can you edit partially?

I'm curious because I'm playing with my own agent and I want to allow it to intelligently update files without rewriting the whole thing.

I provided a search/replace tool, but the llm often doesn't use it correctly (though I haven't spent a lot of time figuring out why).</div>

Frontier AI progress is happening, whether or not a million ChatGPT wrappers deserve their billion dollar valuations. 

I highly recommend the book Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital - this has happened with every single technological revolution over the last 200 years.</div>

&gt;The cycle of scientific discovery is frequently bottlenecked by the slow, manual creation of software to support computational experiments. To address this, we present an AI system that creates expert-level scientific software whose goal is to maximize a quality metric. The system uses a Large Language Model (LLM) and Tree Search (TS) to systematically improve the quality metric and intelligently navigate the large space of possible solutions. The system achieves expert-level results when it explores and integrates complex research ideas from external sources. The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated across a wide range of benchmarks. In bioinformatics, it discovered 40 novel methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated 14 models that outperformed the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. Our method also produced state-of-the-art software for geospatial analysis, neural activity prediction in zebrafish, time series forecasting and numerical solution of integrals. By devising and implementing novel solutions to diverse tasks, the system represents a significant step towards accelerating scientific progress.

Pretty interesting. I wonder if it can be applied to model training.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It is best for scorable task, aka a computation model to describe the observed behavior. If we think of llm as a software to maximize something like coding/math ELO, this could potentially improve math/coding performance of models significantly using existing proposed ideas in papers written by humans. I dont see why it can’t be compounded by recursion.</div>
