5 mins of this practice starts making me light in that frustrating environment.
Try yourself : Breath 4 sec -&gt; hold 7 sec -&gt; exhale 8 sec .
Sit comfortably with spine straight.

Do let me know how you felt!!!</div>

But in my limited knowledge I think the 4 7 8 method is more a relaxation deep breathing technique than meditation.

It is absolutely not a form of meditation, it is conscious method of stimulating a relaxation response in your neck is system. It can be quite dangerous to overdo it. Look at what Andrew Weil has to say in the matter.</div>

It was so ridiculous it spawned a confused-person meme.

Jump to 1:50 to get to the good part, but it's all really revealing of certain conservative folks think, and why they feel to threatened by "leftists", atheist and LGBT people. As Bill himself says... "If I believe God exists and I've been donating time and money to him and I'm wrong, that makes me a colossal idiot." Imho, one way to look at Trump is a period of doubling down after the massive failures of the war,  torture, and early culture-war (anti-LGBT constitutional amendment) campaigns post-9/11.

For those who don't know on the day the ultra plan was presented there were a lot of strange problems. Fast tokens were being consumed by models a minimum of 10x more (where the record holder after a few prompts with a standard claude consumed 300 tokens), I also noticed excessive consumption. Models in the pro plan started to run much worse, slower and there were often some errors.

                        <div class="comment-body">Honestly, managing fixed pricing plans where users can't see exactly what's happening under the hood sounds like a nightmare.

And to make it more complicated, these fixed pricing plans rest on top of model infrastructure that is constantly evolving as new LLMs are released weekly. No matter what they do, they're structurally in a position where their pricing will come off as unfair or lacking in transparency -- even if they're 100% trying to do best by their users.

My hunch is that the industry will move towards 100% usage based pricing (I.e. what Cline, Claude code, Aider do). Not only is it most fair, it's in line with the trend of inference getting cheaper and cheaper.

I know a lot of folks use the Claude max plan, which offers nearly unlimited inference for $200/month, but I doubt that will last forever if folks are getting far more than their money's worth.</div>

I ended up winning the case and just got paid $3,707.

No lawyer. Just me, a printer, and ChatGPT.

It even helped me figure out how to collect afterward. Definitely saved me thousands. AI is wild.</div>

The big caveat, and it’s a pretty big one, is that you need to double and triple check every cite. ChatGPT still hallucinates on cases and on statutes. Sometimes, It might say law correctly but the statute section number is wrong. 

It also still just completely makes up cases. I used it this morning to guide some research and it gave me 3 complete made up cases that did not exist.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My employer took me off the clock completely after I filed an HR report on her for theft and allowing drinking and driving for a delivery driver that she's friends with. 

I had chatgpt create a full timeline of events, help me create emails to send to HR, etc. 

Chatgpt said my case should be valued in the 50-100k region for constructive discharge. The manager made my life a living hell. Took my hours, stole money from me, required me to work off the clock after work on a daily basis, give free rides to employees that didn't have a ride. This bitch had me to the point of calling the national crisis hotline. 

I got testimonies from multiple other managers saying that she is quietly firing me by taking my hours and that this is just how they handle this type of stuff if they don't like you.

Anyways I ended up hiring an attorney. The attorney is currently working on contingency and will take 1/3 after settlement. 

He's advising me to take their offer of 10k and not counter. I said I wasn't settling for anything under $50k and my hours back. 

This is where things took a nose dive. He basically sent me an email saying "if you won't take what I suggested then we should part ways". I asked him about the things chatgpt told me without saying it came from that source. Specifically the constructive discharge. He told me it would be hard to prove since they sent me a letter offering my job back with the same manager and like 1/5 of the pay I would have gotten had my hours not been reduced. 

I don't really have the money to give every attorney their $400 consultation fee so I feel like I'm just kinda stuck with him. I'm wondering if I shouldn't fire him and attempt to use chatgpt to help me resolve it instead.

This case is actually separate from my injury case I filed. It took them nearly 8 months to file my injury report with management all just saying over and over that they didn't know how to fill one out. Now I'm being denied coverage for my injury.</div>

Now however, I've seen several ambitious Veo 3 shortfilms created by creative minds that people are absolutely loving, wanting more and saying things like: "I love how you're using AI" and "Bro literally made a $100,000 shortfilm in his bedroom".

On the other hand, open youtube, slops. Instagram, more slops. Tiktok, also slopsz 

Not denying there aren’t any good AI films, but for every 1 there are thousands that are 0 effort slops and simply people optimizing for social media engagement/revenue (you can literally put it into a slop pipeline).</div>

At that point, people can complain all about AI, but if they can't tell the difference, all the complaint is just moot.

The day of paying $5 for a new episode of our favorite tv show, created on demand, is probably not too far off. Anyone with a good idea, and a few hundred dollars, can create a movie with Avenger Endgame levels of production. It is going to democratize content creation, and make hollywood irrelevant.</div>

Google most likely won't release Veo 4 if it only brings better graphics, physics, consistency and same length. To top something like Veo 3 you definitely need way bigger length. So far this is the biggest bottleneck.</div>

There are far too many creators wannabe that just pump slops because the cost to create one is very low  (and you can put it into a pipeline) and as long as the cost barrier is low they’ll pump more into the market and basically just push people away from AI.</div>

Is this where they _want_ us to be looking?

Certainly it helps to solidify the idea that the 'war' on our telescreens in real.

A navy vet has been [trying to explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Usk5w3R6lW8) for years that it is all a smokescreen.

I asked O3 the same question and it's answer was that right wing is overwhelmingly more responsible for violence. [https://chatgpt.com/share/6852dc34-958c-800d-96f2-059e1c32ced6](https://chatgpt.com/share/6852dc34-958c-800d-96f2-059e1c32ced6)

So i'm not certain how they plan to make the LLM lie only on certain topics where they dislike the truth. Usually the best they can do is blanket censorship like deepseek did with 1989</div>

He is indeed bowing out because he won't have a chance to hold the best tool title but he will have the best tool for people that like confirmation bias for those particular topics. Honestly Musk didn't have a real chance fighting against Microsoft, Google and all the rest so he is trying to take on a niche and it will probably work for him.

Nobody will take Grok seriously for important tasks but it doesn't matter. You can become President even if most people don't take you seriously so probably Grok can survive.</div>

Higher circulation can lead to increased support from local governments and grant providers. Even if you're not reading the books, your checkout helps boost these metrics.

So, next time you're at the library, consider checking out a few extra books. It’s a simple way to support a valuable community resource.</div>

E-books make books more accessible to more people who, for whatever reason, have barriers going in to get physical copies. So it's like yeah, e-books cost money, but it's one of those things you pay for serve your audience more effectively.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not in clinical use yet (of course), they're still monitoring it so we have more to learn. However, what the article did state (I'm copying &amp; pasting it direct from the article):

&gt;In follow-up tests, researchers examined how gene activity changed after removing the extra chromosome.

&gt;They noticed that genes tied to nervous system development became more active, while those linked to metabolism were dialed down.

&gt;This shift in gene expression could help explain how correcting the chromosomal imbalance affects the cell’s overall behavior. It also supports earlier [findings](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3273608/) that extra copies of chromosome 21 disrupt brain development during early fetal growth.

So, assuming that last bit means that if it's done during early fetal growth it could prevent people with down syndrome from being impaired(or as impaired)? I'm not stating that as fact, I am not a scientist or scientifically educated, so that's not to be taken as fact at all. Make your own interpretations. Just genuinely pretty interested in the stuff in the article.

&gt;The researchers didn’t just test their approach on lab-grown stem cells. They also applied it to [skin fibroblasts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/skin-fibroblast), which are more mature, non-stem cells taken from people with Down syndrome.

&gt;Even in these fully developed cells, the method successfully removed the extra chromosome in a significant number of cases.

&gt;That result hints at broader possibilities for correcting the genetic issue in different cell types throughout the body.

Does mature, non-stem cells mean that it would work on people post-birth, when they're no longer a fetus? That sounds cool. Though from the sounds of things if the theory they put forth on down syndrome's brain development becoming stunted during the fetal age, then it wouldn't fix the core problems.

Idk, it's pretty cool to see crispr being used recently - wasn't there another case?</div>

In today’s world, privacy in texting isn’t guaranteed. People vent, share screenshots, or ask others for advice especially when messages are emotionally charged, confusing, or interesting. So before you hit “send,” ask yourself: Would I be okay if this message were read out loud to a room of people they trust?

Be clear, respectful, and don’t say anything you wouldn’t want repeated. This mindset...</div>

It's intercity road. One big almost straight line of well maintained road with clearly visible markings, more predictable behavior of drivers than on regular roads and much more. Many driverless solutions can work great in that conditions, it's more of a regulatory issue, so we hear little about such experiments

&gt;I'm also skeptical of the usefulness of putting a lot of effort into self-driving trucks over just building a train,

But I think he'll simultaneously absolve Trump of most responsibility by blaming it on the "Deep State," Israel Lobby, or military industrial complex. 

He'll do that to placate his MAGA buddies like Dana but also to reconcile his own support for Trump.</div>

Ferrari is all about sound and driving dynamics. I don’t think the average Ferrari buyer is interested in EV’s with a Ferrari badge.</div>

Prestige brands like this shouldn't be held to the same electrification standards, they just don't sell enough volume for it to matter; and the cars they do sell simply are not driven very much.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Matt Farah was recently talking about how much he liked testing the Lambo Revuelto (which has a PHEV powertrain) because in EV mode, he could creep away from the house without bothering the neighbours.

I'd say PHEVs are the likely long-term future for supercars and hypercars. There are absolutely reasons you want silent running, even if you want a V12 kicking in after you've left the compound.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I wouldn't mind an EV as a daily.  But as a weekend car that will see low mileage, give me a roaring engine.  That might even be better for the planet considering that ICE cars pollute as they are driven while manufacturing batteries pollutes the same regardless of the car actual use.

I know some people are wealthy enough to daily their Ferrari, but for many buyers their Ferrari is their special car.</div>
