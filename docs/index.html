- Labor is the one bit of power the working class has over the ownership class &amp; economy.

- As more jobs get automated away with AI, jobs become more competitive driving down the cost of labor. Resulting in more people competing for less jobs, providing more power to the ownership class.

- Soon (1-5yrs, which is optimistic given current rates of improvement) we'll reach a critical threshold where human labor holds little power over the economy. Where choosing ...</div>

And I am not saying they are correct for believing UBI makes people lazy, as small scale experiments imply it is likely the opposite, but at the very least we should be intellectually honest that they were not talking about a scenario where nobody could earn money anyways. 

There would be no concern about people being "unproductive" in a post-AGI world if the AGI can do everyone's job anyways.</div>

People need to mobilize while we still have meaningful leverage. Check out Yanis Varoufakis and Gary Stevenson (Gary's Economics) if you want to dive deeper into this analysis - they've been explaining exactly this dynamic between AI, automation, surveillance capitalism and worker power for years, with solid economic backing.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</div>

What exactly is the 'general strike' intended to do? Who is its supposed to pressure, and what is the intended goal?

If its to pressure the government, why not just vote? 100x easier to get someone on board to vote, than to strike. 

All a general strike will accomplish, is strongly and massively encourage business adoption of AI.</div>

* Every task management system you can name
* "Optimized" morning routines that just drained me
* Email organization systems I'd abandon within days
* Productivity extensions I'd inevitably disable
* Those aesthetic desk setup videos that just emptied my wallet

None of it worked because I was completely neglecting myself outside of work. My health ...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not OP, but I might chime in on that:

Old, or new, every relationship is some work. You can always text old friends, and check in. Ask them how they're doing. Most people are just busy in their own life, and they forget to catch up. So you just have to be proactive. People hate double texting, I don't mind. I text my friends whenever I think of them. No matter if they answered before. Because I know everyone's got their shit to deal with.

So that's the ones you have: how do you go about new ones. I have lost many good friends to drifting apart over time. A lot of friendships have also stood the test of time. But, since some people will disappear, if you want to keep your social circle in a similar size you have to meet new people. I think the easiest is through hobbies. Run Clubs for example. I haven't done it myself, but I bet things like meetup.com work. I am a digital nomad, so whenever I am in a new place, I have to meet new people. So you just get used to getting to know people. In some places it's easier, in some it's harder. I haven't met any people I stayed in touch with in Japan, but every time I go to Thailand I meet 1 or 2 people I stay in contact with regularly. (I'm on my fourth visit now and there's maybe 6-10 people I text weekly or more. Most I've met just during random moments: Sitting in the plane next to each other, talking because I saw them at another place, Randomly sitting next to each other in a café and DN meetups.

So I think just by putting yourself out there, doing things where there's other people and just talking to people, you'll find others to befriend. And even though I have childhood friends and high school friends I still stay in contact with (I'm 30+), I don't think the new friendships are much more shallow. Of course there's a bond that grows over time. But you can form meaningful friendships at any age (or at least I can confirm that happens until my current age. Let's see what the next years bring :D )</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Also not OP but I can chime in on this too. Joining recreational sports leagues made all the difffence for me. I went from having nobody to hang out with to having a bunch of people who want to do stuff together. A bunch of people on Reddit also recommend dnd groups, board game groups and things of that nature. You have to find something that fits your interests, but rec sports will usually be filled with people who are decently social. A lot of teams also go hang out after games, and that’s where you really get to know everyone.</div>

With the old ones, my close friend just finished her licensure exam, so she's not that busy anymore. I reconnected with them and ask them if they want to have a coffee date once a week. And a workout/active day every weekend.</div>

* **Quantum teleportation of logical gates** has been achieved across a network link, marking a significant advancement.
* The study used quantum teleportation to **create interactions between distant systems**, facilitating logical quantum gates between qubits in separate quantum computers.
* This allows for "**wiring together' distinct quantum processors into a single, fully-connected quantum computer**".
* The process involves the **transfer of quantum information over long distances almost instantly, using entanglement**.
* This could lay the groundwork for a future **'quantum internet'**, where distant processors could form an ultra-secure network for communication, computation and sensing.

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s not only the Rihanna incident. He was abusive towards his ex-girlfriend, Karrueche Tran. He allegedly threw her down the stairs and beat her. He also had a baby with another woman when they were together. The mother of his first child also said that he was physically abusive towards her. He is very talented. He’s a great singer, an amazing dancer, and he can act. But his actions have really shadowed his achievements. He’s a piece of shit and every time I bring up the fact that he’s an abuser, they say, “oh, move on! That’s in the past. You’re just a hater.” Like stfu degenerates</div>

&gt;Supplementing the symbolic engine with a language model was a key to AG1 success, bringing the solve rate from 14 (pure deduction proofs) to 25 out of 30 selected IMO problems Trinh et al. (2024). **This language model was trained on a large amount of algorithmically generated synthetic data**.

&gt;In AG2 we use the same procedure. Similar to AG1, our synthetic data generation method starts by sampling a random diagram, and uses the symbolic engine to deduce all possible facts from it. For each of the deduced facts, a traceback algorithm is used to extract the corresponding premises, auxiliary points, and deduction steps that prove the fact. **Our data generation method deliberately avoids the use of human-crafted problems** as initial diagram seeds, and strictly starts from random diagrams. **This design choice eliminates the risk of data contamination** and allows for the exploration of theorem distributions that may extend beyond established human knowledge. This approach contrasts with methods like TongGeometry Zhang et al. (2024), which rely on human expertise and existing problem diagrams to guide and filter data generation. In AG2, we keep using random diagrams as initial seeds and continue to push for better synthetic training data.</div>

Shocking Encounter Over the Atlantic - (Graham Bethune Navy UFO)

Cmdr. Graham Bethune is a retired Navy commander pilot with a top-secret clearance. He was a VIP Plane Commander who flew most of the high-ranking officers and civilians from Washington, DC. In his testimony he explains how he was flying a group of VIPs and other pilots into Argentina, Newfoundland when they all witnessed a 300 foot UFO that traveled 10,000 feet straight up in a fraction of a second toward their plane. He has documented the event extensively.

                                <div class="reply-body">Spielberg I suspect could be someone chosen to give slow disclosure to the public, Close Encounters of the Third Kind is regarded as a very accurate movie in terms of UFO lore. And his latest upcoming one is going to be really good and I'm assuming a modernized version of it... He's either a MASSIVE UFOlogy nerd that knows and can piece things together or he knows people that give him the schpill. 

Him being a movie director, I doubt he came up with the plot all on his own...

I can't wait.</div>

Cmdr. Graham Bethune is a retired Navy commander pilot with a top-secret clearance. He was a VIP Plane Commander who flew most of the high-ranking officers and civilians from Washington, DC. In his testimony he explains how he was flying a group of VIPs and other pilots into Argentina, Newfoundland when they all witnessed a 300 foot UFO that traveled 10,000 feet straight up in a fraction of a second toward their plane. He has documented the event extensively.

All these years, decades and decades in some cases, you’ve been limiting the flavor of buttered toast. It tastes better eaten upside down, the buttered bread hits your tongue and taste buds first. I’d say the same goes if you put a thin bit of jam on your toast too, but not too thick so it’s dripping everywhere.

So yeah that’s my tip. Buttered toast should be eaten upside down.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/PositiveSong2293:

---

Within the scientific elite of the United States, there exists a group of scholars shrouded in mystery. In their daily lives, they are professors and researchers at some of the country’s most prestigious universities, but in parallel, they carry out secret missions with a direct impact on national security and global protection.

This is the *Jason Group*, composed of more than sixty scientists from various fields who advise the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other government agencies. Informally known as *the Jasons*, they are called upon to conduct scientific studies that support critical decisions related to defense and national security.

More than half of the reports produced by this group are classified as confidential. The topics they cover range from nuclear arsenals and spy satellites to biological warfare, ballistic missiles, intelligence, and defense against terrorist attacks. The *Jason Group* was formed in 1960 to provide independent scientific consulting to the Pentagon and has since served multiple government agencies. However, the group’s future remains uncertain. After all, who are the Jasons, and what makes them so special?

                                <div class="reply-body">It's a problem of "Look, we're great at &lt;this one specific thing!&gt;" hype being applied more generally as a scare factor, amidst a time of high interest rates and lack of innovation apart from AI driving companies to go full panic mode as they face a consumer already nickel-and-dimed to the max (I truly feel sorry for whoever is developing AI right now as execs must be screaming down their necks to deliver). Leading to this white collar recession we are facing right now, as companies promise grand things like AI replacing devs. 

Very much like quantum computers being good at &lt;specific math problems&gt;, but how they're hyped to heaven similarly. 

I see only 3 possibilities: 1) AI pans out and somehow does dev work properly replacing them all (the miracle). OR 2) AI is applied, introduces various latent insidious bugs, which, in large enterprise systems, is an inevitable eventuality given how complex the ever changing business logic is, and eventually real human devs are called in to fix the mess, OR 3) humans and AI just coexist and help write the boilerplate code/assist with the common stuff you'd find in stackoverflow anyway. 

I personally see only 2 and 3 happening. It would be amazing on a pure technical standpoint if 1. happened, really. But that would mean catastrophe for the tech companies themselves because if white collar tech jobs are affected deeply, the economy is kaput, and they'd shoot themselves in the feet, because who's spending the money to afford these bloated services now? The high salaries these tech companies provide their employees are what circulates back into them in the first place, padding their profits. You cannot have your cake and eat it too.</div>

His last term, you could count on any time the press said that someone was the “shadow president”, every single fucking time, the person that was being propped up was ejected from the administration. I understand that the MAGA folks want to pretend like “Trump will see right through it, he is not that naive”, I guess we will see, because history tells us otherwise.</div>

Musk is the wealthiest guy in the world and is the leader of this "tech billionaire" faction in his party. Without that faction they probably don't win the election and it could get very messy if they have a divorce. 

So I think Trump has to bend the knee to Musk</div>

I write down everything on my mind, big or small.  
Then, I expand then with clear actions and details.   
Then I prioritize them as top priority, medium, or high  
I apply them to my monthly to-do's on Notion.

**Every beginning of my new phase:** 

I check this note and calendar, update that phase's to-do lists by scheduling. 

**Every day:**

I use Eat the Frog method.  
I write six most important tasks I need to accomplish the next day (personal or professional tasks)</div>

Government, media, religion all work to enslave us in a very controlled system designed to appear as the "normal world."

My conspiracy is I believe the powers that be moved in really quickly to steer this franchise away from creating any more of this messaging.

How does open source AI makes this situation better?

A single human + a personal AI is worth jack all in terms of intellectual labor vs a data center.</div>

If what he says becomes true, you won't need to work, in fact, you would get in the way of productivity if you worked..
It's like bringing a young nephew to work and he damages more things than helps because he is tiny, weak and uncoordinated...

We are the nephew to an AI like the one described in the video, you, I or nobody can grasp what it will be capable off, it will make things out of thin air to us, it will be exactly like we imagine magic to do...

What the fuck do you think a human + personal AI, is relevant for? 
Like an AI smarter than all the inteligence we have today combined in a single entity, and you think you can somehow help by collaborating with it?</div>

Everyone knows widespread phone usage kills socialisation. Most people though think this about opportunity cost. That is, because people are on their phones or using tech so much they’re not doing other activities where they would interact with people irl.

But it’s much more than that. It basically kills motivation to seek pleasure or entertainment elsewhere. You’re getting so much dopamine on you’re p...</div>

Teachers and professors are reporting much the same: A lot of young people fundamentally can't function because of distraction. 

And people are increasingly falling for scams, fraud and manipulation despite "growing up digitally native". 

None of it is unfixable but all of it is a fucking problem.</div>

To the externally imposed individualism, we must also add the manipulation of reality and, consequently, the distortion of the perception of events caused by the irresponsible and often instrumental use of new media by tech oligarchs. Just like during the darkest periods of humanity, it takes very little to trigger a psychosis or a true mass schizophrenia.  I often feel as if "progress" is not a choice but something imposed on us.</div>

Elon is hacking into our personal shit or something. Are we not paying any sort of attention? Or do we want to sit in our privilege and judge everyone who talks about a real issue?</div>

It's like they're saying "but Jesus LOVES you!" except it's with "but politics matter whether you admit it or not!" That doesn't mean that individuals can't choose to opt out of caring about it without making a difference to the flow on the macro scale. They employ logical fallacies to guilt you into caring about politics, when it's actually just a problem habit for people who aren't conscientious about what media they consume and don't know how to regulate their own emotions.</div>
