When they say "AGI" potentially by 2027 do they mean capable of replacing like 90%+ of current human jobs? Or maybe an acceleration of recursive self improvement? 


I ask because the "agentic" aspect of LLMs currently seems to suck. And agency seems to be a necessary component of replacing intellectual labor. Are people expecting us to overcome this hurdle very quickly? I guess we should see what agents look like at the end of 2025.

                                <div class="reply-body">Kleptocracy is biological.  It consumes everything in its path like a parasite.

In Russia it ate Dostoevsky and  Tchaikovsky and shit out alcoholism and hopelessness.

Justin Kennedy (justice kennedys son) was the inside man at Deutsche bank that was getting all trumps toxic loans approved.

No other bank but Deutsche bank would touch trump and his imaginary valuations.

Why?

Because Deutsche bank was infested with Russian oligarchs.

For 50 years the oligarchs consumed everything in soviet Russia. They stole everything of value including the hope of Russians.

The corruption eventually collapsed the Soviet Union like the carcass of a parasite riddled host and the oligarchs were forced to expand their feeding grounds.

In 89 the Soviet Union fails and for a couple of years they hid all their ill gotten gains under a mattress until they started buying condos at trump towers.

They made stops in Ukraine, Cyprus and London but they landed in New York because that was what everyone wanted in the late 80‚Äôs.

Levi‚Äôs, Pepsi, Madonna tapes that weren‚Äôt smuggled bootlegs, Wall Street cocaine

They all bought new suits and cars and changed their title from ‚Äúmost violent street thug in moscow‚Äù to ‚Äúrespectable Russian oligarch‚Äù but they didn‚Äôt leave their human trafficking, narcotics or extortion behind.  It was their most lucrative business model.

Trump and Giuliani just opened the doors and let the predators in to feed. They all bought condos at trump towers and used trumps casinos to launder their money.

In 89 three of trumps casino execs start asking why their books don‚Äôt make sense and they die in a helicopter crash that Roger Stone pulls trump off of at the last minute.

Guiliani redirected NYPD resources away from his Russian allies intentionally and onto the Italian mob.  It let him claim he cleaned up New York and it lets the russians a perk of doing business with trump.

https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/09/a-new-rudy-scandal-fbi-agent-says-giuliani-was-co-opted-by-russian-intelligence/

The attorney/client privilege is their continual work around they use to accept bribes and make payments up and down the mob pyramid.

The insane valuations coming out in trumps fraud trial are a necessity of the money laundering cycle that duetschebank was doing with the Russians.

The reason trump cosplays as ‚Äúfolksy‚Äù is because he is feeding on the U.S. middle class, not because he is one of us.

The GOP fell in line to MAGA because Trump did what pathological liars do, they told them anything they wanted to hear.

Trump with his money laundering and child raping buddy Epstein, Roger Stone with his sex clubs in DC and Nevada, and Paul Manafort with his election rigging pretty much everywhere, sat down at a table with Mike Johnson and the extreme religious right and convinced them that they were the same.

They self evidently are not, at least at a surface level, but there is enough common ground in the exploitation of children, Russian kompromat,  desire for unilateral control that they became the worlds weirdest and most dysfunctional orgy.

Trump belongs to the authoritarians. The GOP now belongs to trump.

But their overall goal is the same.

Kleptocracy.

Putin became one of the richest people in the world by stealing from Russians first.  The Russian oligarchs used perestroika to privatize all the assets of the USSR by stealing them from the hands of the decent people because that‚Äôs what predators do.

We don‚Äôt have a political problem. We have a predator problem. Like murder hornets that invade a beehive and destroy a bee every 14 seconds until the hive collapses the oligarchs want to move into the United States and do the same because none of them want to live in Russia.

Who would? after all, it was destroyed by oligarchs and nobody steps away from the mob, they get retired through violent means.

But all these oligarchs are old now and know they can‚Äôt keep ahead of the slightly more violent and ambitious lion cub beneath them who is growing tired of paying the old man when he does all the dirty work.

The soviet oligarchs ate Russia to death with their greed. Then Ukraine. Now they are designing a perestroika 2.0 to put 330 million Americans into real estate default so they can come in and buy everything up at 3 cents on the dollar. Trump just enabled them.

It‚Äôs the collapse of the USSR, American edition using the naive and compromised GOP as their assault force, But your slave masters are the same. The 3% that are so devoid of empathy that they put their wealth above everything else

Kolomoisky was the putin puppet in Ukraine that bought most of downtown Cleveland.

Before that he started privatbank which was taking IMF loans which the oligarchs would loan to themselves and never repay.

When the IMF figured it out they tried to force Zelensky to have the Ukrainian people pay it back before they would extend any more aid.

Kolomoisky wasn‚Äôt alone. He was just the crossroads between Rudy Giuliani, trump and Kushner.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/giuliani-associates-leveraged-gop-access-to-seek-ukraine-gas-deal/

When Ukraine arrested him last year for corruption it cracked the whole network open.

Trump can‚Äôt stop lying now or his MAGA base tears him apart when they realize he is literally the man who stole the world.

Trump is a pathological liar. But lying is an expensive habit. If you tell the truth, you can say it once and it‚Äôs finished.  You have expelled all the energy necessary for it to stand on its own for eternity.

Lying requires infinite and exponentially more energy input in the form of more lies, bribes, extortion and murder to keep it covered.

Trump is now testing this theory on a worldwide scale.

Putin is tied to him by the purse strings and so is everyone who pushes Putin‚Äôs narrative because puppet strings work both directions.  Why would any sane human push a psychopaths lies unless they are heavily invested in it?

The difference is, this is the first time in known human history that the Information Age happened. You can hide your neighborhood bullshit in 1980.  It‚Äôs harder in 2000.  By 2024 the internet knows more about a narcissistic oligarchs movements than he knows about himself.

It‚Äôs just a matter of organizing that data.

They couldn‚Äôt self regulate their greed.  It‚Äôs just following the roach trail back to nest after that.

                                <div class="reply-body">I tried DMT a few times in the 90s because I had heard that people would have experiences like this on it.

My experiences I can only summarize as a lot of confusing feelings, sensations, thoughts, and actions. I did not hear voices or see images. I was also experimenting with LSD, mushrooms, PCP, Coke, heroin, weed, and the usual stuff around the same time. I honestly didn‚Äôt ever sense that I was experiencing anything like a ‚Äúlucid dream‚Äù on anything, although was a lot of the reason I tried these things. And DMT, in particular, was not ‚Äúhallucinatory‚Äù or ‚Äúvisioning‚Äù for me in that way nearly as much as LSD or PCP. And those were still not entirely experiential. I came out of that period totally fine, but annoyed that there was no turnkey approach to another dimension or parallel reality.

That said, I do think one could use drugs like DMT to essentially force themselves to believe they had such an experience. If the desire is there, I think it‚Äôs very much possible to change reality within one‚Äôs own mind with drugs. Unfortunately, drugs wear off and the effects do not affect reality outside of the drug-taker, as much as they may want to believe they do.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Regardless of whether or not these claims are true and the alleged experiences were truly real or not,

It's interesting how many people take what contactees are told and shown at face value.

Taking into account the vast amount of truly anomalous sightings, close encounters, abductions, etc. there is something interesting which stands out.

That is that there is inherent trickery involved in UFO phenomena. 

It isn't necessarily deliberate deception, or nefarious, but it is clearly there. From the craft/hard objects, to the beings themselves, they are clearly not truly what they appear to be. They say and show contactees things which are nonsensical, they make predictions which never come to pass, the beings themselves are nonsensical, they are figments ripped directly from the human imagination.

So, I don't think one can or should take these scenes at face value, you need to look deeper to attempt to determine what is trying to be communicated and why.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I find it really strange how anyone takes ANY visions, whether it's abductee or psychedelic, at face value.

In the case of psychedelic experiences, you know that you took a substance that altered the way you thought. So why is the altered thought considered "pure" or "real" afterwards, instead of an elaborate parable akin to a dream? 

In the case of Abductions - if whatever the beings are, have all the required ability to do what it takes to do those things to you, then they ALSO have the ability to show you whatever the heck they want. I demoed VR for a living and people legitimately felt they were on a high rise building and couldn't make themselves take a step IRL to walk off of it, they were that scared. And that's just with 2016 level human VR tech.

The question should be: Why would something that advanced let you remember anything at all, when modern anesthesia doesn't let us remember Jack? Why would those things show as Mantis, and not as Ancestors or indescribable beings? Why would they communicate in a way we can understand whatsoever, instead of just being completely non communicative and enigmatic? Why believe at all, anything you were shown or told? People don't even believe other people - why do these Beings get the benefit of the doubt?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I honestly think that you need to go on a case-by-case basis and form your own opinions about things. I think you make some valid points that in that the beings can convey whatever they want to you. They have often used religious imagery with certain people during abductions as well. 

The thing is, though, I think you might fail to make forward progress if you simply dismiss the vast majority of things as 'trickery' by the NHI. I've listened to, watched, and read the accounts of hundreds upon hundreds of abductees. You can definitely start to put together a relatively decent picture after enough pattern matching. I will caveat it though. This picture still leaves so much unknown. Granted, I am still actively researching myself. There is still so much unknown. Partially exciting and partially frustrating though :).</div>

Weirdly it's via Grok in Twitter only, but you can now ask for arbitrary edits to generated images - e.g. "make the shirt red". And the model will regenerate the image with only that change (modulo very minor details). They deliberately restrict this so you can't edit user provided images.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I go to my library weekly and I'm seriously worried about libraries losing funding for books. Nowadays they almost have to buy subscriptions for ebooks, audiobooks, and movies which are much more costly than physical books, CDs, and DVDs. And shelf space for the latter is cleared for computers, learning centers, etc. Unless there's a large enough counterculture movement in place to preserve physical books, I fear they'll become something like vinyl records- still existing and manufactured but impractical for anyone but collectors and enthusiasts.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Why it works:
Your brain ties habits to specific locations (e.g., you crave snacks in your living room because you always eat there).


Instead of relying on willpower, simply change your setup (move your desk, sit somewhere else, swap lighting).


This forces your brain to ‚Äúreset‚Äù and makes it easier to quit bad habits or start good ones.</div>

My wife had a desk in the other room so I tried going there and forbidding myself from doing those things, what I ended up doing is staying at the dinner table after breakfast and lunch much longer, because my brain knew that in the room I have to work or code.

Still trying to change my procrastination habits, but I haven‚Äôt found any good ways. :(</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That actually makes sense! Your brain already linked certain rooms to relaxation, so just moving didn‚Äôt fully reset the habit loop. You accidentally found a workaround, though staying at the dinner table after meals because your brain didn‚Äôt associate it with distractions. Maybe try intentionally making a new ‚Äòwork-only‚Äô space that‚Äôs separate from your usual setups? Even something as simple as a different chair or facing a different direction might help. Hope you find a system that works!</div>
