                                <div class="reply-body">What is a shame is that most people don't have a handle how long "brief" is likely to be.

No one knows *precisely* how long "brief" will be  but we can put some fairly solid lower and upper bounds on it.

It is very unlikely to be less than 6 months or a year. There is the potential of that but most people &amp; evidence suggests that is not the case.

As for the upper bound, that's trickier. 30 years seems deeply unlikely, 60 years seems impossibly long.

Personally I think the answer is less than 10 years, probably less than 5 years before even the smartest humans are far outclassed by AI.

Whatever the final answer is, humans being born today will live in a world where they know they aren't the smartest thing around.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I wonder if it'll follow the path of coding.  It's gotten to the point where though i'm generating thousands of lines of code, i've only manually written maybe 10.  I'm still giving pretty strict instructions on architecture, flow, design.  I'm in full control, but i'm no longer writing the code.  It turns out, writing code wasn't my job, and without having to write code I can do 10x more.  I'm more useful to my employer now than I was before.

But I think the caveat is I've also personally moved beyond the "code monkey" role.  I learned the business, I understand the problem domain i'm coding for.  I think if I was simply following a spec, the person writing the spec would take my job.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The thread is worth a read, and even ignoring the recent Terence Tao and Scott Aaronson posts, I've seen multiple examples of similar posts by mathematicians. What's telling is that last quote:

“So it looks as though we have entered the brief but enjoyable era where our research is greatly sped up by Al but Al still needs us.” 

I think many Mathematicians think this is just a small window where they have the equivalent of Centaur Chess supremacy, before what seems like the inevitable next step.

To add Gowers is a Fields Medalist and just a very well respected powerhouse in the math community. It's not like, just some guy.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If youre an expert in an area current AI is a wonderful tool that helps you speed up and improve your ideation, refining them, and presenting them.  It gives solutions you would not have easily thought of and because you know your area well you can give better and more specific prompts and then when it generates something untrue or not what you actually need call it out on it and get to the real answer.  In my corner of the world it saves me hours of effort to get to a better end product.  What it cant quite do yet is replace the worker and work independently.  Maybe it never really will in the foreseeable future.  But for right now it makes my life easier.</div>

Of course that's absurd. That's the whole point. That's a vague announcement, at best, and it is basically begging the recipient to chase them down to fill in the blanks.

"Hey, we should do coffee" or "hey, we should get together some time" and others like that are performative and equally vague. **This kind of ambigui...</div>

But your examples don't really fit. If I say to you "Hey, we should do coffee", I'm hoping that you'll respond positively to that, which essentially gives me permission to then make a specific plan. If instead I just jumped to, "Hey meet me at Coffee Shop X at 10am on Tuesday", it would be weird and offputting since I haven't even indicated whether I would like to meet you for coffee or if I even drink coffee.</div>

But consider also that it's a machine that is working with a set of instructions. Out of the box it will act like an agreeable cheerleader.

You can change the instructions to whatever you like and it will work like you said.

You just need to change the settings. As is with many machines we have in life, a little bit of setup and personalization is needed.

When I was in my late teens and early twenties all the folks would go on and on about how this would happen to "us" at the hands of the democrats. Turns out Republicans assume everyone else thinks the way they think. So looking back they were really just telling on themselves about how they want to brutally subjugate their political opponents. This ICE agent is enjoying grinding that "little liberal bitch" face into the pavement. Absolutely despicable.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Sam wants to be the main person responsible for what he presumes is the most valuable, beneficial, and transcendent technology humanity will ever develop: AI (ASI). 

Money is a short term motivation. If you’re pessimistic, Sam seeks power — but not necessarily money (although money is an instrumental goal). If you’re optimistic, Sam has a savior complex and wants to be known within history to be the primary individual who changed the world. An implication of this interpretation is that he *believes in the technology*. It’s an educated faith that he has, and likewise he has faith in the picture of a beautiful future where humanity prospers. 

From this line of thinking my major criticism with Sam is that he is putting the lives of all of humanity at risk just to be this historical figure. He’s putting himself first in the end. I don’t tend to moralize things or people, and I don’t believe in the common, superficial sentiment that Sam is ‘evil’ (a notion resulting from modern-day reflexive paranoia around CEO’s, billionaire, ‘elites’, etc.) But he *is* putting everyone’s lives at risk by rushing in blind — most other criticisms are a guise and a distraction from this fact.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Arguably yes they could’ve kept the profit cap, but it would’ve likely made it much harder to raise more from investors as there is less incentive for them to invest, and thus may lead to OpenAI not being able to compete in the race to AGI and potentially failing to succeed in their mission to develop AGI. And it would’ve very possibly resulted in the non-profit having less funding long-term too, since their funds is also reliant on investors.</div>

The core argument: biological intelligence emerged from survival pressure, not design. Curiosity, cooperation, innovation - all emergent responses to existential stakes. Current AI development tries to scale capabilities (GPT-4 → GPT-5 → GPT-6) but this produces better tools, not autonomous beings.
The proposed alternative: AI agents with r...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I just hope they don't institute some kind of 'AI vs AI' where one model 'defeats' the other and learns from the 'battle' how to survive. That's likely how you'd build a survival pressure and instinct.

And therein lies the problem. Do you REALLY want AI to have a survival instinct that might lead to an 'us vs them' situation?</div>

I don't know, maybe I have a weak back, I don't seem to have any serious posture issues though, but sitting with a straight spine always leads to high tension either in lower back or in the lower part of the ribcage, which usually leads to tensed breathing (for example, I just did a meditation ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There is a certain minimum amount of muscular tension necessary to maintain a straight spine without support, of course, but it shouldn't be seriously uncomfortable. I would guess that you're just straining too hard to keep your back straight. I notice that a lot of people who are starting sitting meditation seem to initially interpret "keep your spine straight" as "extend your spine as much as possible" until they get used to how an relaxed but upright posture feels. 

Since you're a singer, I would say "sit so that your breathing is as open as possible" rather than "sit with your spine straight". That's more likely to bring you to the right place.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">As a side note, the Buddha probably suffered from a herniated disc (or several) and had severe back problems from about the time he was 60, so the last 20 years of his life. 

He didn't complain much about it but it happened. As he got older it was well known that he needed some support for his back if he was going to sit for any length of time as it is clear from suttas that such a seat was prepared for him as he got older. 

He did also meditate lying down. On his right side, it is said. It also happened that while he was supposed to sit up and teach or talk to somebody, his back was hurting too much and he lay down and handed over the talking to Ananda. On those occasions it did happen that the old man fell asleep. This is an image of the Buddha we've forgotten. 

If meditating lying down works for you then I say you're fine. I fall asleep way too easily if I lie down. I generally sit fairly comfortably too. 

There's a lot of struggling going on with the posture. Keeping your spine straight, sitting in full or half lotus pose, or for that matter the idea that it's somehow necessary to sit crosslegged on the floor. I wish I'd taken the advice of wiser people and just bypassed all of that. 

The Buddha's instruction is simple. He does say to sit down crosslegged (but does not go into detail of any particular way of doing this) with the spine erect. Now, he was living in India at a time when chairs were basically unheard of. Translated to modern times he was simply saying to sit up comfortably.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I was not aware of the Buddha suffering so much physically as he got older. Somehow I always had this image of him being young, shiny and sitting in perfect lotus pose. 

Right now I practice meditation daily sitting in the Burmese pose. It's a very good sitting posture but when I started meditation I did so sitting on a chair and I still remember the good sits I had. Sitting in the Burmese pose does require less effort for me atm somehow. A poster above said it well, the body locks into position by itself in a comfortable way. Should I get old and require a chair again then that's good too.

Thank you for your post.</div>

Didn’t really do any regular compound lifting or Olympic lifting. 15 years later I’m walking around 185lbs, still run 6-7 min miles for distance, squat upper 300s, DL lower 400s, snatch mid 200s, clean and jerk high 200s. Still do class regularly. Never a competitor level. I’d be your average better guy at any gym. Wear basically the same clothes, larger shirts. Was it “CrossFit” or just getting around fit people, learning, and being consistent year over year, definitely. But that’s not the environment I was going to find in a “traditionally” gym.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">So basically „what is my goal“ and „what is the compromise I’m willing to make for both sides“. Which is both quite important to understand in a conflict. 

Because just understanding your own goals will result in you trying to back your opponent into a corner, ignoring their point of view in the whole situation.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Any kind of relationship requires at least 2 people. It sounds like you have made up your mind already. So there's not really any conversation needed. Tell them how it is and move on. 

It'd be hard to apply OPs tip to this situation. When your goal is to get out of the friendship. And your draw the line minimum is the same. It's not really a conversation. There's no room for the other side to have an input and offer/request concessions.

Now if you're on the fence or want to try and repair the friendship that's a different story. 

Either way, I hope the best for you. Even if it's the right move it always feels bad leading up to ending a friendship.</div>
