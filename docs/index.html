                <div class="post-content">Subaru revealed the Performance B STI concept with a fully completed interior, and exterior. Looks very promising to eventually become a production vehicle.

The interior view shows a modern WRX interior, but with SI-Drive, and a DCCD selector, along with STI labeling, and a flat bottom steering wheel.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think the main issue is just how ugly it is. Like I expected slightly more flared fenders, maybe some extra ground effects but otherwise it would look like the VB WRX version of the impreza hatch with a big wing.

Instead it somehow looks like a riced out narrowbody GR STI fucked a Civic Type-R, it's actually quite horrendous even for Subaru lol. 

Honestly, though, I don't expect it to really look like that by the time it hits the public. Actually it's really not that bad except for the front end. The hood vents and the scoop look awful as does that weird black bit at the front of the hood. If they just gave it a slightly modified VB WRX front end, it'll be significantly better.</div>

Once we see Figure 03 integrate the palm cameras and force sensors it’s going to get crazy. They plan to solve the software issues too which are keeping them from moving faster. 

Imagine Figure moving at lightning speeds while the imitation tries to teleoperate.</div>

I had always heard the official narrative was calls about dozens of teenagers fighting inside the mall. It's suspicious that no cellphone or bodycam videos exist of the brawl. I do remember however people claiming they saw shadowy figures inside of the mall and that both the air pressure and temperature seemed to change. Definitely one of the weirder incidents in recent memory.</div>

Always see the same few photos from the same angle or the same videos. I live in Florida and frequent Miami. We live in the digital age where everything is documented and cameras are everywhere yet we have the same angles? Take note of the AI “fuzz” over all the images from this event. Dig up all the archived videos and it all looks like Sora footage…

                        <div class="comment-body">tbh, they've come further and more quickly that a lot of people thought they would (including myself)

energy based models have talked about for about 30-60 years now, with LeCun (and many physicists) favoring them, but they've never been in vogue because current compute architectures have never been able to run them efficiently outside of relatively toy problems. 

It'll be interesting to see what researchers do with these pieces of hardware. I doubt they'll have real commercial use for years.

And yes, the current AI hardware bubble allows speculative investments like this. Not necessarily a bad thing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed. I don’t see the benefits of energy based models over diffusion models, but if you are going to use them, such hardware choices where you can directly and efficiently sample Boltzmann-like distributions is a smart idea. 

I know these ideas of thermo computation have existed before Extropic. Not sure what the real bottlenecks to utility are.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is stupid on both sides but people supporting the NCAA actions and take on this are extra dumb. 

Here are Lia’s national ranks in the 200/500/1650 yard freestyle swims from male to female categories. 
554/65/32 to 5/1/8. 

Even worse when Riley tied for Lia in the 200 they gave the trophy to Lia for the photo op and we all know why. 

Oh and Lia hadn’t gone thru the full surgery yet either and was only in year one of hormone suppression. 

Idk what to tell you all if you think that’s fair to women. Lia should have competed with the men and the NCAA is right to bar it going forward. 

It’s simple really. We have a women’s category that is for biological women. If you want to get really technical and talk about the 1/1000 or less women that aren’t XX with the specific gene expressions we can but as a pretty good rule being XX is sufficient. After that we have an open category. Anybody who is good enough can compete in that category including women. 

For reference this is how almost all professional sports already are.  It’s not the WNBA and the MNBA. It’s not the MPGA and the LPGA. If you’re a woman and good enough you can play in the open league. 

I can’t believe how much energy as a society we waste on an issue that barely impacts anyone and has an obvious solution that the minority can take or leave.</div>

Doran's paper titled "There's a S.M.A.R.T. way to write management's goals and objectives" introduces a framework for setting management objectives, emphasizing the importance of clear goals.[^(\[1\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria#cite_note-Doran-1981-1)[^(\[5\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria#cite_note-5) The S.M.A.R.T. criteria he proposes are as follows:

* *Specific:* Targeting a particular area for improvement
* *Measurable:* Quantifying, or at least suggesting, an indicator of progress
* *Assignable:* Defining responsibility clearly
* *Realistic:* Outlining attainable results with available resources
* *Time-related:* Including a timeline for expected results</div>

It was dominated by people who had clearly developed unhealthy relationships with GPT4o.  Sam Altman said a few times during the Q&amp;A that they had no plans to sell heroin to the masses. But it seemed clear to me that quite a few members of their massive customer base got addicted to the less powerful opiates (sycophantic models) already on the market. OpenAI has been talking about "treating adults like adults...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean, this argument is fairly easily countered by looking at what OpenAI is actively doing. It's plainly obvious to everyone else, and thus plainly obvious to them, that they have a large subset of users who are highly addicted to these AI personalities and would pay for them, but OpenAI seems to be intentionally pushing back against this.

If what you were saying were true, I'd have expected OpenAI to respond to the 4o outcry by not just adding it back, but also introducing a whole new host of personalities and leaning in to that part of the  product.</div>

It makes money to the extent that customers pay for their services and don’t use them. Like health insurance companies. So their financial interest is in finding the sweet spot where users are just invested enough in their product to keep paying for it, but not so invested that they use it more than the minimal time needed to justify (in their minds) the monthly payment.</div>

The entire point of marketing/advertising/time on site maxing and all the rest is to find reward channels that we are not consciously aware of and take advantage of them.

&gt; You don't think people can be trusted to make their own decisions

It's like trusting someone not to get tricked by an optical illusions. You can explain exactly how the trick works, they understand perfectly well that the lines are the same size or that the grey squares are the same color, or the circles are not really spinning on the static image, yet they exploit a facet of your mind that you have no conscious control over.

And optical illusions are easy to show the mechanism that you are being tricked by. When the problem is a slow inculcation you don't have any defenses against it. Most people will they will say they are not swayed by advertisements, yet advertisements work.</div>

Altman is a snake-y fuck. He says he doesn't want to "sell heroin," but he's sold ChatGPT from the start with a whiff of science-fantasy.

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly about using medical tape (could be substituted for bandaids) I’d probably never consider using a lubricant/grease type solution for nipple chafing. Then you’re wrecking shirts, it’s possibly wearing off mid run, might show through the shirt during a run (pictures), and I’d just have far less confidence in general. Using tape or a physical barrier is a life changer and there’s never any question that it’s going to work or that it might cause issues. It’s literally changed my running form. My nipples were always slightly chafed (I attribute it to sprints and HIIT more than long distance) but when I really started upping the distance from both sprints and low intensity long distance runs the slight chafing went from annoying to causing me to compensate by leaning and avoiding having my shirts hit my nipples, even subconsciously. By adding tape I can run with full confidence and no nipple pain based form inhibition, as ridiculous as that sounds. I guess it’s the same as any other “injury” though but less obvious and less severe potentially (but it can definitely get severe), but it can easily force your runs to be suboptimal and you to go slower, the same way shin splints or a nagging muscle strain might cause you to compensate.</div>

The amount of absolute, literal garbage was disgusting. Half used packets of unidentifiable sludge, expired goods, damaged goods...


Too many people treat food drives as an opportunity to clean out their pantry, I guess with the idea that the needy should be grateful for anything they get. But seriously, if it's too spoiled or expired for you to eat it, put it in the fucking trash bin where it belongs!


If you can't give cash, volunteer your time. If you can't do that, then it's kinder to do nothing than to make the food bank throw out your garbage for you.</div>

Any time I’ve donated I’ve mainly given beans, corn, tomatoes, and green beans.

We talking like canned pumpkin? Beets?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is also true for almost every type of nonprofit. 

One of my family members works at a domestic violence shelter and people love to donate little hygiene packs or whatever but I've seen people's faces absolutely fall when they find out the nonprofit can use that same amount of money to get 10 times more stuff, or even more than that. 

Not only do they get bulk buying deals, but a lot of companies will give nonprofits stuff on top of that. Basically, they almost never need your stuff. Nonprofits need your money, and every bit counts. $5 might not seem like a lot to you but when everybody gives $5, that becomes a powerful amount of change in your community.</div>
