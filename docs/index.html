\- PCI express card  
\- 30W power consumption  
\- Claimed around 100 MOps  
\- Targeting around 60.000 units in the first year  
\- Can be produced on "obsolete" semiconductor nodes (20nm +)

Generally the tech claims:  
\- 30x increase in energy efficiency  
\- 50x increase in compute speed (with semiconductor tech in the single digit GHz range and optical being able to achieve two to three figure GHz numbers and a single processing core being able to handle multiple wavelenghts of light at once in parallel)

Still a long way to go till we have fully optical computers, though. Optical RAM is still a largely open field waiting to be solved to unlock true speedups.</div>

I played it over a decade ago and enjoyed it. 

Photonic computing is one of the nodes on the tech tree along the way to sub-planck scale hyperdimensional multiverse computronium :).... 

Maybe real world we get 3 or more OoM's out of this tech if it works as advertised - and I bet they will find ways to push it further.</div>

From my layman knowledge, it's impossible to make memory from light, so there's some overhead from converting data from photons to electrons and back.
I'm sure there is some other stuff.

No technology is perfect, everything has some downsides, especially so early in the development.</div>

I imagine their tech worked with nature/the universe as opposed to everything we do today that goes against it. Our food is poison, our medicine is slowly killing us, our energy isn't sustainable, our air and water is not clean and all this wifi/bluetooth/5g wireless tech is not in harmony with our bodies.</div>

Looking at the progress we've made in such a short time makes it hard to believe this is the first time we've made any major advancements in one way or another. 

Modern society/government wants you to believe we're the pinnacle of humanity right now and they are to thank for it, if we knew that completely different ways of life and and systems have come and gone with no trace then we might see our mighty governments as disposable or lose faith in them.</div>

For example, he mentioned offhand that his band room could really use a big dry erase board for creating set lists. I jotted it down and next chance I got, I gave it to him! He was stoked and surprised I remembered.</div>

And they're not just stealing Claude compute use and reselling that, there is a legitimate value layer added on top that ManusAI is trying to capture on.

If anything stuff like this should be encouraged, we've only really just begun exploring even current stage LLMs and there is a lot more value that can be gained from using LLMs in a lot of different areas that haven't been explored.</div>

That's what MOST products we have in the world are. Everything is about taking a bunch of things around us and compiling it in a useful way.

The Babylon Project was a dream, given form. 

Its goal: to prevent another war, by creating a place where humans and aliens can work out their differences peacefully. 

It's a port of call - home away from home - for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs, and wanderers. 

Humans and aliens, wrapped in two million, five hundred thousand tons of spinning metal... all alone in the night. 

It can be a dangerous place, but it's our last best hope for peace. 

This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations. The year is 2258. 

The name of the place is Babylon 5.</div>

In 2021 it developed into agoraphobia. I'm still working through it but deleting FB and IG has given me so much relief. The answer for anxiety is staying in the moment cuz anxiety is fear of the future. Staying off your phone really helps keep you in the moment and you'll also see your confidence go up too.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hi everyone,

I'm a 20-year-old student with a variety of interests outside of university. I love playing sports, playing the guitar, and drawing. However, I’ve been struggling with something that I can’t quite understand.

For long periods, I completely neglect my hobbies—not because I don’t have time, but because I just can’t seem to muster the energy to actually do them. For example, I often tell myself, “I should practice the guitar today,” but then I end up spending the whole afternoon on m...</div>

For example, every night I pack my work bag for the next day, which is now an automatic habit. Next to my work bag is a bookshelf. Now when I finish packing my bag I grab a book and tell myself I’ll read 10 pages. Usually I read for longer. 

You have to take things you already are doing and stack them with the habits you’d like to add. Take it slow and make it EASY for yourself to do it</div>

A lot of hobbies require you to get 'warmed up.'  There's a cognitive barrier to entry. You have to get into the mind space of doing it.  When you're not in that mind space, you can only imagine it, you cannot experience it.  Your imagination of  it is not as compelling as experiencing. 



Also, your phone is is full of apps designed and optimized to suck up your attention and have as little barrier to entry as possible.     So in the time you took to write this post, you could have picked up the guitar and gotten warmed up.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A trick that I find super helpful is going up to one step. Something like "I'm not going to practice the guitar, I'm just going to take out everything I need" or "I'm not going to cook dinner, I'm just taking out all the ingredients." Another good tip is counting down mentally 1, 2, 3 and then IMMEDIATELY starting. Often that initial muster from the count if enough to overcome the inertia. Finally, the last trick I use is the "2-minute rule" where I say I'm. going to do something for just 2-minutes.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I do stuff like this too and I dont get why it works because I KNOW I'm tricking myself.

Two examples of my own:  

Needed to go to the gym for a run, but didn't want to.  Told myself just go and walk on the elliptical for an hour instead.  Then I go there, get all changed and ready to go, and I'm like "Screw it, might as well go for a run on the treadmill" and then I ran an hour.

I make my own ice cream, lately I've been kind a lazy with that. Since I eat low carb/high fat if I dont make my own I dont get a treat the next day. I constantly put it off even though it takes 10 min to make a batch of 4 quarts.  So I do what you suggested, I tell myself just to get out all the stuff for later.  So I get out all the ingredients, the mixer, the plastic containers and then at that point I'm like "Well I might as well just do it since I'm already this far into it"

So often it's just taking that first step and everything falls into place after that.</div>

No middle ground, no actual conversation—just extremes. Too many echo chambers, too much one-dimensional thinking.

I made a comment about how outdated the Nintendo Switch is, which is *objectively* true when you compare it to modern hardware. Instead of an actual discussion, I get downvoted into oblivion.

Contrary to this community's cynicism, *"The Age of Dislcosure"* documentary seems to be doing a good job opening the mainstream media floodgates. Variety is not fucking around with this article - This is more direct and to the point than even my posts on this sub.

&gt;***If you don’t believe in aliens yet, you’re behind.***

&gt;*The United States has been secretly working to capture UAPs — unidentified anomalous phenomena, the more formal term for UFOs —* ***since as early as 1947***, according to many high-ranking figures throughout the government, military and intelligence community. There is evidence and documentation of all kinds of findings that feel like the stuff of sci-fi: vehicles that appear to disobey the laws of physics, difficult-to-explain interference with American military activity and, indeed, ***the bodies of intelligent, nonhuman beings.*** ***Multiple species, at that.***

&gt;***If you’re feeling overwhelmed by all that info, take a breath. Yes, there are 80 years of covered-up research to catch up on.***

&gt;*Farah decided to create a resource to make people aware of what he calls “the base facts”: “The fact that we’re not alone in the universe. The fact that there has been recovery of technology of nonhuman origin. The fact that other nations are also recovering this technology, and that we are in a race to reverse-engineer this technology.”*

&gt;***That race is a large part of why certain information remains classified and is considered by the government to be unsafe to disclose — anything shared with the American people is also shared with the rest of the world***

Will be remembered for many years to come as a low point in American history.

The fact that somehoe a "journalist" from Russian state media "snuck in" in to the press conference is also highly suspect. Meanwhile trumo banned AP and Reuters?

It's easy to see this as hyperbole. But what were witnessing honestly has a lot of parallels to the fall of rhe Soviet union. Everyone knew the entire system was crumbling. They saw it with their own eyes. But they didn't speak of it. Instead they focused on traditionalist tropes and nonsense.

Just a reminder the president began his state of the union talking about trans women in sports. And went on to speak about a girl who got hit really hard by a volleyball. This, at a time when we could really be on the brink of wwiii. 

This is a guy who blamed a plane crash on the faa hiring too many dwarves. Like.... At a certain point is the other half of America going to realize the wheels have come off? We've already jumped the shark. It's only a matter of time I think before we see a similar breaking point, as what occurred in the former Soviet union. The delusion can't last forever. It almost never does.

And also. I'm not talking about some dramatic civil war or revolution. I think that's unlikely. But a collective realization that everything Trump promised (and he promised a lot) isn't happening is going to be hard to ignore.

I've trained this squish effect LoRA on the Wan2.1 14B I2V 480p model and the results blew me away! This effect got really viral after being introduced by Pika, but now everyone can use it for free.

If you'd like to try this now for free, join the Discord! [https://discord.com/invite/7tsKMCbNFC](https://discord.com/invite/7tsKMCbNFC)

You can download the model file on my Civit profile, and also find details on how to run this yourself: [https://civitai.com/models/1340141/squish-effect-wan21-i2v-lora?modelVersionId=1513385](https://civitai.com/models/1340141/squish-effect-wan21-i2v-lora?modelVersionId=1513385)

The workflow I used to run inference is a slight modification to this one by Kijai: [https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper/blob/main/example\_workflows/wanvideo\_480p\_I2V\_example\_02.json](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper/blob/main/example_workflows/wanvideo_480p_I2V_example_02.json)

The main difference was that I added a Wan LoRA node and connected it to the base model. I've attached an image of exactly the workflow I used for this.

Let me know if there are any questions, and feel free to request more Wan I2V LoRAs - I've already got a bunch more training and will update you with results!

The company settled for $1.7B, Scott stepped down as CEO, and plead the 5th (remain silent) 74 times during deposition. He claimed he knew nothing about it for the 7 years HCA had been committing the fraud.

He used his wealth to become Gov of FL from 2010-2018 and then Senator after that.</div>
