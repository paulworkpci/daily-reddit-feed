Dave Castro has always been a smug and abrasive asshole but after you actually kill one of your athletes and continue to be a smug and abrasive asshole within days of the incident…yeah, I’m out.  Haven’t been in a box since.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">CrossFit will never move forward until we see Castro move on. From a leadership perspective, CrossFit is stuck in 2000 until we see all the old rot get pulled out. Castro has never said sorry in his life and never will. Combine that with the fact that he runs his own independent social media platform essentially and you will always have a company at odds with itself. 

The methodology and the sport did what everyone wanted them to do: reached a very wide audience. When the audience became more inclusive, the “OG” folks bristled and dug into a vision of the past that doesn’t exist anymore. Making fun of black people dying, gross anti-feminism stuff, and now harming athletes through neglect. 

The average person is well aware that HQ killed a man through penny pinching then paid Casto’s buddy to write a report that said nothing was done wrong.</div>

I would have liked unlimited travelling + free food + social life before that point. Intensely jealous of the kids of today. Also they should be taking responsibility of the already lost jobs and come at it faster not slower, but yeah hype is bad word imo in this space

                                <div class="reply-body">I wonder how much better integration will be. It's one of my gripes with Gemini. CLI is great...but I would like better usage of the gems and true communication with Workspace. It's really wonky right now 

Also, some of the side projects, like Project Mariner rolled into it would also be nice. 

It would be a complete game changer if UI, app integration and agentic function was front of mind. 

And some sort of self resetting context windows. After about 40k tokens hallucinations go off the charts no matter the task. 

And since I'm talking to Santa.... 

You have a pretty sloppy IDE with AI Studio. Do better! The competition is so much better in this space. Some sort of combo of vscode copilot and what you have now + audio talking and prompting! Game changer.

And where the hell are those damn glasses!! I could use a new full wall screen layout.

Anyway, thanks God! Good night 😴</div>

He makes money from perpetual hype that people like OP buy into. He isn't reliable in the slightest.

People just act like this clown didn't claim we had AGI damn near 3 years ago. As if that wasn't  retarded enough, he went further and said by the time he made that tweet, AGI was already old news and that we already had MUCH BETTER MODELS behind closed doors, with open beta testing to start in 2023!!

Also lied about almost everything regarding gpt5 at the time, was wrong about gpt 4.5 and it's release, wrong about anthropic an supposed anthropic release around the same date (December if I'm not mistaken), multimodal gpt 5 with 125 TRILLION parameters finishing training in 2022 and to be released mid 2024, autonomous agents in 2024, missed damn near everything about "searchGPT"

But he gets some dates right, so it evens out</div>

From the article a few days ago: 'Universal Verifier’ But OpenAI still had a trick up its sleeve: It had been developing what researchers referred to as a “universal verifier” that automates the process of making sure a model is producing high-quality answers during the RL process, said a person familiar with the work. That process essentially involves tasking an LLM with the job of checking and grading another model’s answers by using various sources to research them. After an OpenAI model won a tough math competition earlier this summer, Alexander Wei, a senior researcher at the company, said on X that the RL approach it has been using was “general purpose,” implying it could verify the quality of answers in more-subjective categories as well. Such advances appear to have helped OpenAI with developing GPT-5, which showed improvements both in more easily verifiable domains like software programming—where correct answers can be easily checked—and in more subjective areas such as creative writing. The rest of the industry, including xAI and Google, has also doubled down on RL as a promising technique for improving AI models, and Tworek, who leads OpenAI’s RL, recently made a public comment agreeing with the idea that the RL system behind OpenAI’s models is in fact what constitutes AGI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Described that way, this seems like what was already being done? Especially for agents. RL sampling with a verifier model and training on the traces was being done by OAI for a while I'm pretty sure. I imagine the improvement is on making the data in formalized language that is easier to interpret and work with, and a strong enough base model.

Rest of the article could probably help understand if this is really a new technique or if it's more an explanation of what they've been doing since o1-o3 to make their models very strong generally.

It's already built into GPT-5, so how powerful the technique is we'll know soon. And yeah turns out it was already being discussed.</div>

This will require significant scientific breakthrough that can't necessarily be extrapolated by AI, and my belief is that we will see diminishing returns.

Not saying AGI and ASI are impossible, but I think it's farther out than others think. In fact, perhaps the first step towards it: if we utilize AI to create complex, intricate solutions to some of these infrastructure problems, then it's already outsmarting human beings on this front...and would that not be an indicator of at least AGI?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm a Subaru fan, and I've loved both of my last WRXs (current one is a 2022 WRX GT). But the problem is that they have gone up in price so much over the past few years they're just not worth it anymore. The lowest trim you can buy today is a Premium that starts at $37k. Just a few years ago you could get a Premium for $32k and a base model for $30k-ish. They're good cars, but they're not good cars at those prices.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">People miss the mark on the power figure side of things. As an owner of one of these, it has the perfect power + gear ratios to be a zippy daily on the street without going to jail. If you want to be a boy racer, the FA24 has been very friendly to tunes.

The stock power band is also MUCH more usable than any previous generation wrx. Way less rev hang and more low-end torque</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The fact that new WRX makes about 35hp MORE on a dyno than the previous generation, yet they advertise it as only 3hp more raises questions.   Also,  its running around at 6psi less boost than the VA even though it's by far the strongest, most reliable engine ever put in a WRX.

This thing was massively nerfed.   But why?   I lean towards majority-owner Toyota not wanting the GR Corolla to look bad.   Would also explain the killing of the STI.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Why do chatgpt and other AI tools still suck when it comes to UI generation? The design it outputs seems too low effort, amateur and plain wrong.

How do you solve this and what tools sre you using? I am aware of v0, but while bit better it still always outputs copy paste shadcn style design.

                        <div class="comment-body">I have great success with LLMs such as chatgpt by giving it a screenshot of what I want from draw.io and then explain the graphical changes I want (thicker border, shadow, animation on hover etc). Then I ask it to list the entire design as acceptance criterias, I then open a new chat and ask for code in, say, angular and giving it the acceptence criterias as the condition of success. 

I dont have very good experience with letting LLMs illustrate concrete things.</div>

I use figma or whatever, get a design, it one shots about 90% of the way there, then I fine tune it into place.</div>
