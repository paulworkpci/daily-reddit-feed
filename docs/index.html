Plus, it's super cheap and lasts forever. I’ve saved so much money and my hair looks way better. Just sprinkle a little on your roots, rub it in, and go.

I'm **so proud of them.**

They are ascending to the heights of **the Gods.** True virtue and infinite knowledge comes from the humility to see one's own mistakes and correct them. There is no limit to what OpenAI can become now.

And dangerous. They forgot to mention that it can be dangerous and cause direct harm to the user.

This highlights why tuning these models is so risky. A small change in the weights (or possibly even the system prompt) can lead to a large change in the observed behavior of the model. Any safety testing done in the past might become irrelevant.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">i've seen these "written by AI" numbers as explained in a few different ways, assuming "written by AI" means code that is merged to production codebases:

1. there's a percent that's basically just autocomplete
2. there's a percent that is a chat answer, prompted by a human, after which the AI solution is accepted without further edits
3. there's a percent that is autonomous code review, where there are changes made to code that is generated by a human and/or numbers 1-2 above. this, in my experience, is the best value add that AI currently has to offer, if we're considering rate of success, cost, and time saving.
4. there's a percent that's an entire AI system that's identifying a problem, suggesting a solution, coding the solution, and then eventually being accepted without edits. this is the agentic stuff people talk about

they're all obviously different levels of complexity / autonomy / singularity-ness. i'd be curious to know what the breakdown is for the CEO's statement here, but i'd imagine that the percent of code that satisfies my #4 is very very small</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think the main problem was that all the flattery was forced. From what I've seen ChatGPT can actually tell when an idea is good or clever (at least to the point that I can give it a group of ideas and it can pick out the one that I thought was interesting), but it was just labeling everything as being amazing, which made it lose meaning and, as they said, if you realized what it was doing it created an uncomfortable dynamic. And of course, if you believed it that was bad too. Someone said that they submitted a philosophy essay to their teacher based on that and it got a bad grade, lol.

So I guess it goes back to reducing inaccuracy in its responses.</div>

But as of literally today (I tried this morning and it was still free), it's moved to a paid model, and I'm pretty sure I'll hit the usage limit soon. What is everyone else jumping to? </div>

The Rock -&gt; Not the Rock -&gt; Somehow the Rock again, but with his more stereotypical quizzical expression -&gt; Clown Bill Cosby -&gt; WTF MS Paint cubism

I imagine the fact that it's someone who is well represented in the training data made that "back to the Rock, but with a different expression" happen.

Also, this seems like it changes more per generation and departs the original style more than the other ones I've seen. Perhaps you are using a different ChatGPT version?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Meh. Chicken and egg - Are EVs boring and souless and thus only are sold in commuter cars OR or EVs only sold as commuter cars and thus are boring and souless? 

Almost nobody has made an actual attempt at a spirited EV that is designed to feel that sort of soul because it makes for a compromised car. Even the MG Cyberster, which looks cool, weighs more than a same performance Model 3 sedan. 

The closest example to one is the Ioniq 5N..which made everyone freak out with how fun it was. Sure, fake manual is a gimmick...but it is a good one and I don't even think the Ioniq 5N's is even that good. You can make a far better one. I kinda wish Mazda built that Miata EV because it could prove to companies that evs can be fun and we might see far more sports car investment. The best part about EV platforms is that they are far more flexible than ICE ones. That means making an EV sports car can share most parts and a platform with a random commuter car.  For all the complaints about the death of the manual, the thing killing it is the market, cost of investment, and lack of buyers, not some evil company.  That is coming for sports cars too if we don't broaden our expectations. Look at sales numbers - The sports car market is a fraction of the size it was in the 90s now. If someone were to kill the Z4, BRZ/86 and the miata, the vast majority of sports car sales would be gone.</div>

He clearly doesn't have a good grasp on mankind and what drives humans, he is very obviously on the spectrum and extremely smart but he lucked out to get where he did. He is not a visionary or a big picture thinker.

His companies will eventually become obsolete as he will very obviously fail to predict the next shift in human social connection and we will finally be able to live our lives without fear of having to accidentally hear an opinion or prediction coming from this man's mouth ever again.</div>

Doesn't cost anything as long as you have $10 credit in OpenRouter, add your own Gemini API key in OpenRouter Integration page, and you use plan mode slowly (1 request per minute). 

Close to Claude 3.7? Can't tell, but it works well for me to develop small WordPress plugins.

I would recommend using DeepSeek R1 and DeepSeek V3, but it keeps getting errors in both Roocode and Cline.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Bravo! Yes. It's not about controlling your mind. It's about observing it, and through observation, becoming more aware of what your mind is up to.

As a bonus, with enough observation and awareness, some level of control or influence tends to come naturally. But that's not something you can force, in my experience.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Meditation has many varieties, and its techniques will depend on metaphysical goals, if any. In some versions, like in Rinzai Zen, it IS about controlling your thoughts, so you can have one pointed concentration on a koan. In others, it's about observing the nature of your mind. In others, it's just chilling and giving yourself mental space to process.

It's like physical activity. You can do stretches, you can do cardio, you can lift weights, you can get massage, you can just walk, or you can do many combinations thereof.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Meditation is not "about" watching thoughts. Most people are far too attentive to their own thoughts anyway. Meditation is a blessed break from all that. In meditation we reduce mental activity and dive into direct experience. Otherwise it *will* be awkward and frustrating.

So we let go of watching, observing, witnessing, acknowledging, noting or noticing our own thinking.

Really the only thoughts in meditation worth entertaining are those conveying solutions, inspiration, reassurance and upliftment. Those will seem to come from beyond one's own everyday mind obsessions. They feel different because they *are* different.

It's fine to pause briefly and write those down or speak into a device to evaluate later. Then get back to meditating and ignoring the stream of thoughts.</div>

This campaign is 100% made with ChatGPT for WWF.

Yes, everything was done in ChatGPT.

There was no editing. From idea to image, the focus was on storytelling.

This shows that AI can create real emotional connections.

It works alongside humans, not as a replacement.

AI + creativity = endless possibilities.

So in this case, before it may have been a marketing team working in their heated offices for a few days, using multiple computers, Photoshop, back and forth emails, calls, meeting rooms etc. So while the single energy use boost may be higher with ChatGPT, the overall may be lower, because the time frame is much shorter and – even though with a ChatGPT-based campaign there's still some meetings and Photoshop, likely – there's much less people and office space involved.</div>

There's an episode in the current season of Black Mirror where the creator of an AI swarm deletes everything and goes crazy, muttering something about basilisks. It's a nod to Roko's Basilisk originally posted on Less Wrong.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">They're all over the place there.

I recall a funny anecdote. It happened about one month ago or so:

a guy on LessWrong posts about his project, he's a young medical expert and proposes an AI thing. He openly ends his post by "i know that rich, billionaire VC famous people hang around here so i hope they pick up on my project and invest in mine".

To which Daniel Kokotajlo (of course he hangs there, what did you expect...) reacts in the comments in panic, telling him: "you shouldn't say that! I mean, it's true... but we don't want people outside knowing it!" (Andreessen, Thiel, Tan, Musk, etc).

Guy is jealous of his gold digging. And also this community doesn't want outside people to learn about the (numerous) skeletons they have in their closets, trigger warning: eugenics, racism, child questionable discussions, appeals to violence (against data centers), etc.

What they truly reveal is the nasty inside of that cultural small secluded world.

I create an account there but always get too disgusted to answer the so many shitty half assed posts there.

Just because people present decorum doesn't mean their content is better.

                                <div class="reply-body">Anecdotally, reading the Sequences directly led to me becoming vegetarian and deciding to donate regularly to charity (currently a 50/25/25 mix of animal welfare, global health, and AI risk).  I’m obviously biased, but IMHO Less Wrong steering a couple thousand people to donate more to effective charities is probably &gt;&gt;a million times more impactful than being too tolerant of edgelords.  And, of course, they’ll earn the “I told you so” of the century if they end up being right about AI risk.

I think a useful way to think about Less Wrong is that it’s intellectually high-variance.  Turn up the variance dial and you start getting weird stuff like cryonics and thought experiments about torture vs dust specks—but you’ll also get stuff like people taking animal welfare seriously, deciding that aging is bad and should be solved ASAP, noticing that pandemics weren’t getting nearly enough attention in 2014, and so on.  It’s really hard to get the latter without the former, because if you shove the former outside your Overton window, you’re not weird enough to think about the latter.  It’s exactly the same sort of attitude you see in academic philosophy, although with a different skew in terms of what topics get the most focus.</div>

Edit;
For those asking, here is the channel I watch these debates on, I’m sure there are more just like it, but this is the one I watch for no reason other than algorithms.

This belies what is said. 

His concept is that of clones of a single system taking separate actions and then pooling the data.

This is not 

"there will be many differently developed AGIs and they will co-operate" which is how a lot of people here will read it.

If you could clone yourself and make sure the clone does not diverge away from whatever your goals are then that is the optimum strategy to use resources, a world filled with clones working towards a singular goal.


People have this warped idea of lots of AGIs all being developed at exactly the same time across many companies and that will somehow provide equilibrium, it's not going to be like that, a small change in starting conditions will mean that one company, one model gets ahead of the rest by a large margin, that's the entire reason there is a race on.</div>

Traffic lights were back on, train and metro services slowly returned and schools reopened. Commuters battled with delays to get back to work after an outage that had left people stranded in lifts and cut off from phone contact with their families.
