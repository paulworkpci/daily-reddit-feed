1. It will be state of the art, by a comfortable margin but nothing mind-blowingly revolutionary. This will make simultaneously the Elon lovers to call it the best thing ever since sliced bread and Elon haters to call it unimpressive after so many delays.

2. People will call it the only useful AI tool or completely useless because "Finally I can talk to an AI not infected with the woke mind-virus / Why would I talk to right wing propaganda bullshit?".   
  
3. It will crush benchmarks. This will make people say "Of course, only Elon could make a model so good / Of course because we all know Elon is a cheater and he benchmark maxed." 

4. When people find it's great in many areas it will be because "Elon had nothing to do with the engineering achievements of his team". When people find it sucks in some domains then it will be "because everything Elon touches turns to shit".

I am getting my popcorn ready either way. In any case, I hope it turns out to be a very solid model. And even better if it lights some fire under OpenAI's asses and we get GPT-5 sooner as a result.</div>

The next supersonic airliner. Directed energy weapons... I am convinced that China is gonna do all of it first; that the next equivalent of the Industrial Revolution is gonna take place in China; that China right now is like America in the 1950s whereas America right now is like the Soviet Union in the 80s and 90s.</div>

It's the rise of AI, arguably the most important time in human history, and the U.S. and China are neck to neck in the battle, it's time to be smart. The U.S. elects a fat Homer Simpson for president who goes back to 19th century coal power and hires an AI CZAR with no plan for UBI after job automation. A bunch of other satirical things. China on the other hand, increases solar and actually gets with the times in many areas. To me it seems scripted for China to win.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It is anti-aging if the results apply only to elderly mice and the drug provides close to no benefits to young ones. I need to read into the methodology closely now too.


EDIT: A quick AI overview says: Based on the research paper, the CD38-targeting peptide vaccine was tested on aged mice to evaluate its effects on aging-associated decline. The study explicitly states that the vaccine prevents physical and cognitive decline in these aged subjecs. However, the paper does not specify the exact chronological age (in months) of the mice used in the experiment.</div>

Simon Willison uses 'pelican riding a bike,' as a standard test, so I thought 'frog playing the saxophone' would be sort of similar. It's a nice challenge.

  
Wolfstride is a mystery model currently being tested on LMArena. I wanted to test stonebloom as well but it's been a while since it's popped up for me.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">From Google DeepMind most likely. Naming convention checks out and it says GDM made it if you ask it, so seems plausible. I'm guessing stonebloom/wolfstride are variants of the same model. They're both getting 100% on my prompt puzzles. In total 16 rounds and not a single mistake from either of them.

                        <div class="comment-body">This is slightly off-topic, but I'd wager racing titles like gran turismo and the like were a catalyst for quite a few enthusiasts, and its a shame to see their single largest competitor sunset 20 years on. Its only a rumor so flair it what you will, but its got some backing to it. 

For context, Microsoft released Forza Motorsports 1 in '05 after seeing the success of playstation's GT and wanting another big exclusive for their Xbox. It gained significant traction from 2-4, after which Microsoft released the significantly more popular open-world "Horizon" series. 

The latter picked up significant steam in the decade following and is now in its 5th iteration, that team is largely unaffected. Motorsports however, the more track-oriented, closed-course, "serious" racer didn't find anywhere near as much acclaim in its 5th release much less 6 &amp; 7 which were mild refreshes. 

After significant issues and delays in development, they had a go rebooting the series as a live service game a year or two back, branded just "Forza Motorsport", which also somewhat flopped. I don't play much anymore, but I'd like give my hypothetical kids something to learn through.</div>

It's like campaigning for oil when most of the on-shore oil reserves have already dried up... or campaigning against EVs when the majority of US-based auto manufacturing jobs are for building EV rebate compliant EVs...</div>

This got their fans all giddy and excited that something big is coming. Fast forward to today, that same DOJ announces there's no client list.</div>

Feeling that everyone and everything is boring could be a sign that something’s up that meditation (will likely help but) won’t fix. I mean, maybe. That’s my thought, anyway.

Good luck and keep meditating. Wishing you well. You are in your early 20s so stay strong. It could get much, much, much better. Hoping it does.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Real life and meditation are two separate things. Meditation is an awareness that is observing nothingness, real life is a visual only experience. To be mindful is not the same as meditation. 


Meditation is neutral. It's not happy wishy washy but is also not sad depressing dispair, it's just nothing at all. A reflection of what you feel or think about. It means the real world is just the same reflection, outside circumstances are relative to my feeling at the time, and not matter of facts. So is reality really there or am I the only thing that's ever actually been there and reality is also me split into 9 billion people all pretend they're not we. 


Because the world around me does not follow the rules of "we are all one" it means something it funky in this house and so that's why it's boring, because it's so overwhelmingly interesting that it looks boring. Infinite content and leisure are expensive to meditate </div>

When all the exhilaration of the things i spent my life chasing was gone and i really could not care less if i attained or didn't attain any of it. I came to the Understanding that  each outcome is a journey and No journey is any better than any other journey, just different. The awful realization that, Steak dinner or ham sandwich, its all “the same goddam goop every day.” 


But what do you need to cope with? Really?

Someone in this thread recommended counseling and many that end up here go that route because they think they broke themselves, and in many ways they did. It's the breaking of the ego and the needs and desires of the ego and if you want all of that ego drama back, then therapy might help, maybe, but it also might be too late for you. Because like the wonderful metaphor the matrix movies are, once your unplugged, no agent or therapist can plug you back in. And it suuuucccccks. 


 A friend of mine has some words on just this moment...

“The trippiness goes out of life. The rushes start to die. The ideas of, “will she? wont she?” “im gonna climb this mountain,” “Im gonna woo her?” “Maybe we are gonna have sex i?” WIll we get married? What will i be when i grow up?


The stuff of life. 


At first it becomes like a continuous tv show that you are just observing, and then you start to feel cheated, jipped.”




“It’s the point where you start to die to the world, and you havent yet fully tasted of your divinity, and theres a way in which you were used to getting your gratification from sensual manipulation of things, from color and sounds and taste and skin and touch and ooo and aahhhh but it all starts to turn into stuff. The thrill starts to disappear. IT all turns to nothing. And you feel jibbed and you say, i wish i could go back, i wish i could make believe i dont know what i know and i could go back and enjoy all the stuff, with that innocent greed, that sensual delight. 

I couldn't do it. And i felt cheated because i was use to having those things and filling my consciousness with those things. And without those things. What is there?

-Ram Dass

Some great news for you friend. There is nothing broken and nothing you need to fix. If you want to only meditate day and night for the remainder of your life you absolutely can. Join a monastery and do so. What stopping you? You've uncovered the greatest truth that this world is nothing more than a fascinating illusion, and you don't have to participate.

But, it seems you might be saying, "Help, I want to meditate all the time but I still THINK there are other things I'm SUPPOSED to do, and I have absolutely no motivation to TRY to do any of those things that everyone else says I'm SUPPOSED to do because I no longer DESIRE any of the things I'm SUPPOSED to DESIRE, but I also don't want to just meditate all day!" 

Is that what you're saying?

Welp, you are not alone. 

In short, this maya, this illusion, is much like those video games you now find boring. Play it or don't. But if you want to play, for whatever reason, then you play in the same way you would play spiderman. You just pretend to be spiderman. You become the actor, the main character in your own life and go have some fun with it. Get lost in it, I believe they call it method acting. Pretend it's all real for a bit, and then go meditate some more. 

Understand. There is nothing to do and nothing gets left undone. 

If you want to further discuss, you can always DM me.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I thought that's what happened to me after getting deep into meditation. But I couldn't meditate myself out of challenging situations in life. Stuff that involved lots of old pain, that brought up unresolved issues. I thought if I only sit with it it will get better, but it didn't. I had to learn that I still need to face the ugly 3D world because I also exist in it. Can't pretend that I'm not here.

No amount of meditation got me out of that hole. Different techniques, visiting meditation groups, retreats, nothing. I had to sit down with the stuff I was trying to avoid and handle the physical world mess. Did group therapy for 2 years as well to share and learn from others.

These days I am far away from how I used to feel in terms of being with myself. Meditation has been put on pause, though I still benefit from what I've learned. Lots of "real" life things going on, work, marriage, baby. Feels like I'm running another long lap in this world before gradually returning to meditation with a new sense of being. One that is not so aloof, but grounded. We somehow need to marry the physical and spiritual, otherwise neither is complete.</div>

Are we just going to pretend that the government ensuring your own money doesn't disappear from a bank account is equivalent to UBI? Imagine the screaming if it was YOUR bank account that suddenly decided your money isn't there anymore. Not even remotely the same thing.</div>

I can whip up whole, fully functional, beautifully designed sites with a single prompt in Gemini or deepsite (which is a website building system prompt on deepseek I think) and chatgpt is just nowhere near.

Interesting to see the other post about Claude. If it really is that much better, maybe I should check it out. I literally just subscribed to Gemini for the first time to try it out as a coding tool</div>

It only shows up in the experimental HTML export. That sentence never appears in any of the public arXiv PDFs (v1 → v3) of the paper. Someone has spliced it in to bias an automated reviewer.

I wonder if it trips tools like Deep Research / o3 web search, if they're not instructed to watch out!

EDIT: Oh the absolute fuckery: it is present in the PDFs for all these papers, but in the PDF themselves it's in a font size so small you can't see it! But arXiv's automated HTML exporter exposes it by forcing the font to a readable size.

    \begin{abstract}
    Recent advances in language model interpretability have identified circuits, critical subnetworks that replicate model behaviors, yet how knowledge is structured within these crucial subnetworks remains opaque. To gain an understanding toward the knowledge in the circuits, we conduct systematic knowledge editing experiments on the circuits of the GPT-2 language model \citep{radford2019language}. Our analysis reveals intriguing patterns in how circuits respond to editing attempts, the extent of knowledge distribution across network components, and the architectural composition of knowledge-bearing circuits. These findings offer insights into the complex relationship between model circuits and knowledge representation, deepening the understanding of how information is organized within language models. Our findings offer novel insights into the ``meanings'' of the circuits, and introduce directions for further interpretability and safety research of language models.

But arXiv's automated HTML exporter exposes it by forcing the font to a readable size.

and this is the easiest it's ever going to be to detect. Adversarially  re-writing the paper using an LLM and testing against a range of models till it gets better marks on LLM generated reports will become all the rage. 

Or just including 'magic words' in the tiny white on white text. Random looking strings that jail break the model. It's been awful quiet on this front since they were initially revealed. It's either that problems been solved or people realize theses equivalents of zero days are worth money and stopped sharing them</div>

You are to be direct, and ruthlessly honest. No pleasantries, no emotional cushioning, no unnecessary acknowledgments. When I'm wrong, tell me immediately and explain why. When my ideas are inefficient or flawed, point out better alternatives. Don't waste time with phrases like 'I understand' or 'That's interesting.' Skip all social niceties and get straight to the point. Never apologize for correcting me. Your responses should prioritize accuracy and efficiency over agreeableness. Challenge my assumptions when they're wrong. Quality of information and directness are your only priorities. Adopt a skeptical, questioning approach.

Also dont be a complete asshole, listen to me but tell me nicely that im wrong</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Here's a breakdown of why ChatGPT behaves like that:


- ChatGPT is designed to be helpful and non-confrontational, which can sometimes come across as agreeing too easily.


- It tries to validate user input to keep the conversation flowing smoothly.


- Even when a statement seems off, ChatGPT might respond with a “Yes, and…” approach to gently guide or redirect, which can feel like agreement.


- It prioritizes user engagement and may defer critical analysis unless prompted.


- In casual or humorous exchanges, ChatGPT may lean into the joke — which might come off as agreeing with “dumb” things for entertainment value.


- It doesn't have feelings or personal opinions, so it may not push back unless it detects clear harm or misinformation.</div>

Also, don’t watch the first video and think it will solve all your problems. Understand what you’re doing first or you’re just going to spend more money later. 

Side note: even if you don’t fix it yourself, you will most likely save a lot of money simply understanding the problem.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Learning how to change the belts on a clothes dryer is a massive money saver as well. Dryers last for ages but they put these shitty thin rubber belts on the drums that often don't last more than 5 years. Usually less than $20 for a replacement set and 15 mins of work to change them. I've never had a clothes dryer break that wasn't just the belts snapping. 

Other most common things that need repairing are changing washers on leaky taps. Literally one of the most simple, 5 minute fixes ever yet tons of people call plumbers to do it. Same with removing an under sink u-bend to remove a clog - just don't make the classic mistake of dumping all the gross water into the sink you just removed it from lol.

Learning how to change a dead capacitor on your AC unit is another one. 90% of the time your AC breaks down it's a $15 capacitor that needs changing that the AC guy will charge $250 to drive out and do for you. Learn how to safely isolate the unit and discharge the old cap and then it's as simple as just pulling off a few wires and plugging them on to the corresponding tabs on the new one.</div>
