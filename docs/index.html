                        <div class="comment-body">First you have to download the app "google ai edge gallery" and there are options to choose (Ask image, Prompt Lab, AI Chat). I tried Prompt Lab, there were several gemma models to choose 1.1B to 4B. (557Mb to 4.4Gb)

  
I tried it, most of the shorter model hallucinate(starts typing gibberish or random numbers) after writing a short para. And the larger model was running very slow with a very high latency generating tokens very slowly (I don't have a good phone).  
As of now I don't think there would be any use of this model as they hallucinate a lot.

But as they will make the model small in future and optimize the inference part it will be very useful for people in remote locations, people going for hiking, trekking etc</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Even my 2019 One Plus 7 Pro can run the models at usable speeds, without bad power draw or heating.  
I suspect because it's OS is relatively light and it's got 8GB of memory. It's not even using the GPU or NPU to accelerate on it yet.  
The largest model even generates decent (for an LLM) C# code in my tests, a bit better than ChatGPT 3.5.

I suspect that Apple's miserly attitude to memory on phones is/will be their main problem with Apple Intelligence.

Looking forward to seeing how fast it runs on my Lenovo Y700 2023 that arrives tomorrow.  
Do hope they will release larger Gemma 3N models and a desktop OS runtime that can leverage GPUs.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Tibetan monks in neuroscience studies showed dramatically reduced brain activity in areas linked to suffering while exposed to pain. The subjects practiced a specific meditation technique for only 5 months, which reduced their brain's receptivity to pain by 50 percent. One can only imagine a monk that practices it for 10 years.

Suffering is the mental and emotional reaction to pain. It’s how we interpret pain. By modifying our intepretation of it, we can mostly avoid suffering.

                        <div class="comment-body">I appreciate the line of reasoning here but it should be pointed out that this post is a bit misleading because these studies exclude major factors outside meditative practice alone which monks depend on to achieve emotional and mental well-being. 


Monks don't develop meditation alone they develop the entire range of the Eightfold Path and success in it is contingent on the degree to which ethical and empathetic criteria are developed.


The emotional and mental well-being which monks possess is predicated on ethical and empathetic development first and foremost as the basis from which meditative capacity and effectiveness will grow. 


It is actually the cultivation of sila, virtue which is the source of well-being and meditation capacity is what results from that.



In short, a person with a meditative practice alone will not benefit to the extent as a person who combines a form ethical/empathetic development as a basis on which meditative practice is developed.


Ethics/empathy + meditation = emotional &amp; mental well-being


I hope framing it in this way is helpful in understanding how sustained well-being is developed.</div>

Put the Dalai Lama in long term homelessness, terrorise them and young children in their care, remove their ability to act autonomously and you'll soon see them failing. Suffering isn't all of your basic needs being met, it's a normal response to the consistent pattern of intentional refusal to provide safe access to basic needs.

This post is simply amplifying privilege which is denying reality of the vulnerable. We would all love to sit in a monastery on a mountain and meditate or pray all day.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">As an experienced meditator, i can point out one of the most common ways people experience this transmutation of suffering from pain into joy and peace from pain. Ask anyone who has gotten into fitness. It sucks at first, you have to force yourself to do it, and its excruciating in the process and recovery but as you adjust to it, not only does the pain stop causing suffering, it becomes exhilarating and you start to crave it or atleast accept it as part of the experience. Any sensation physical or emotional can have this transmutation through the right mental work.</div>

Personally I have always thought of him as a bit of an idealist and too preachy (I think he owns this, referencing it in the podcast) but also as someone who genuinely wanted to do what he thought was good. 

In my opinion, I found the episode to be one of joes best in recent times. His stories were interesting, he was charming and funny. The Johnny cash impression was great. Him and Joe appeared to have good chemistry.

                        <div class="comment-body">"I was pulling out onto a thoroughfare street from a strip mall parking lot when warning lights appeared on the Charger's instrument panel for the stability control, frontal collision warning system, regenerative braking and more. There was also a short-lived message — it might have been something about the forward collision warning system — and that the car would be in low power mode. This wasn't good. 

I could tell something was wrong because the car accelerated sluggishly. I got the Charger up to the speed of traffic OK, but then I noticed something was very wrong when I slightly lifted off the accelerator. First, the Charger wasn't using any regenerative braking to slow itself down like it should. (In an EV, you typically lift off the accelerator and the car decelerates without using the regular friction brakes.) It wasn't coasting, either. It was, in fact, accelerating.

I watched the speedometer and could tell the Charger was gaining speed at approximately 1 mph per second, even though I did not have a foot on the pedal. "</div>

Apparently there is zero need for technical understanding to be one 


Of course the car won't use regenerative brakes if it just had an aneurism of errors 


First and foremost they'll make sure you won't kill the battery, so less power output (like you also get in a gas vehicle that has an error, look at that) and no recharging of the battery cells whatsoever by the vehicles own systems. So no Regen braking </div>

They have replaced the 12V battery 4 times and even replaced the cars ev battery.

None of this has helped and the car still bricks after being on a wall charger.

I wanted to like this car so so much. It was exactly what I was looking for and I think it looks much better in person. But based on my experience I would tell everyone to avoid this car even with the amazing lease deals. Naturally my dealer won’t work with me to get me out of the car and stellantis engineers have visited the car at the dealer multiple times with no improvements.</div>

This isn't the 1950s, where it was someone unusual to move out from your hometown/state. Everyone I have known my age has moved many times, criss crossing the country. 
That seems real annoying to get a new phone number each time to...what? Fit in with the new ZIP code?</div>

I've had to do it twice because for the first 11 years out of college I worked sales jobs and had a work phone and just never bought a personal phone. Job hopped twice, had to change numbers twice.

Have a friendly chat with the proprietor about the weather, latest news, whatever. Describe your problem. Watch him nod sympathetically. “Ayuh, we can fix that for you. We’ll give you a good deal, too. What’s your num-bah?”

Say, “Area code . . .” and then anything other than “207” (even “area code” is enough, since Mainers only ever give seven digits in their phone numbers). Watch the light leave his eyes, and with it, your “good deal.” Don’t bother trying to explain that you’ve lived here for 15 years. Don’t bother saying that you grew up here, in fact, and you just happen to be at college in Massachusetts when you got your first phone. Just hang your head and shuffle out and hope he doesn’t screw you too bad on the bill.

And while your car is being fixed, head to the nearest Verizon store and change your damned number.</div>

Folks just reading reports and nodding their heads while providing nothing of real value.

 Those are the jobs being "replaced"... because they shouldn't have existed to begin with. 

This is just an excuse to do cleanup that should have happened regardless.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree with the first part.
But there are def jobs being lost (others being created too), in copywriting, in translation, SEO, and is not necessarily because AI can do it, but because now one person can output a lot more work with the help of AI, does less necessity for as many as before..
Entry level programing jobs have decreased too, not because AI can completely replace a an entry level programmer, but because another with AI can do the job of 2 or 3..

3D product visualisation, less jobs too, as AI is used to generate backgrounds (that would take hours before), so now, 1 3D designer can do the job of multiple..
And the market does adapt, but AI is going evolving really fast, and you have to update at a much faster pace to keep up with new jobs or expectations.

You talk about the current state AI as if  it were the final state of AI. What can replace "useless" jobs, as you put it, today will be able to replace "useful" jobs very soon after—probably sooner than you suppose. 


It is useless to bifurcate the coming obsolescence wave into two camps as you have just so you can feel safe that you've put yourself on the "winning" side.

                                <div class="reply-body">Indeed. The job cuts came with reduced liquidity. The big companies starting cutting and AI simply give them an excuse.


Think about it for a second. The only limitation to growth these companies used to have was getting enough qualified workers. AI should simply increase growth rates... But it doesn't because the plateau of growth has been reached.


Simply put. They need to cut to become more profitable as there is no more growth to gain. </div>

Like, in my lifetime the changes in the world have been incredible… Flying is the worst because people come back from flights and they tell you…a horror story…They’re like: “It was the worst day of my life. First of all, we didn’t board for twenty minutes, and then we get on the plane and they made us sit there on the runway…” Oh really, what happened next?  
  
Did you fly through the air incredibly, like a bird?  
Did you partake in the miracle of human flight you non-contributing zero?!   
  
You’re flying! It’s amazing! Everybody on every plane should just constantly be going: “Oh my God! Wow!” You’re flying! You’re sitting in a chair, in the sky!”

No amount of shiny toys and "cool shit" will satisfy humans because that is not what humans are programmed to really care about.  Humans have evolved to care about social bonds small peer cohorts and having the illusion of agency.  All of these things are missing in modern life, that's why we have so many mentally unstable people. Our environment is not conducive to a healthy human being.  Its possible that future technologies might solve these things via virtual environments where people can live out as they really want, but I wont hold my breath seeing as the people in power tend to gravitate towards power seeking behavior that usually fucks the peasantry below them.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yea this weekend has been rough between this and Torian Pro. Torian always does a great show but I am not going to stay up overnight to watch it and now have no way to view it in the States.

This Sevan crew claims to be all about growing and saving CrossFit. Perhaps they are. But, I think we will look back and realize they were the entirely wrong people for that job. They speak for a loud minority. The negativity and brashness of that crew is not what is needed for CrossFit to prosper. Hopefully, they can realize that before it is too late.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Torian is actually posting the whole livestream on their YT, a day late tho. But still, 8 plus hours of day 1 is on YT and coverage is great. We’ll probably get Day 2 tomorrow. On the other hand, Syndicate is plain awful. Horrible streaming, no proper coverage or camera angles. Just one camera angle and we are forced to watch douche bags commentating in the bottom corner.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think the advanced metric stuff being incorporated is some of the best analytical content that’s ever been provided for a broadcast but the actual personalities speaking behind the camera are a 12 year olds idea of what “edgy” commentary is.  There’s flashes of really solid coverage in there but not nearly enough to make up for the amount of cringe worthy comments they feel are appropriate.  They’ve just had their worst impulses humored by fans for too long and it just turns the broadcast really unprofessional and at times crass.</div>

                <div class="post-content">A few weeks ago (the VEO 3 release week) we featured that crazy popular fake car show VEO 3 video in our podcast on YT and I woke up this AM to see that there was a copyright claim against it from a French media company Group M6. Which is super weird because... this footage has never existed?

I posted on X about it to (the very awesome) creator of the video and they got the claim too. So now, we're stuck in a place where we'll dispute it but I mean huh, it's super weird.</div>

But directly striking is unusual... Since that stops the revenue entirely...

So it might be a bot on their end which thought this video to be one of theirs and did this automatically?

Either way, dispute the strike. They are likely to not follow up on it and Youtube will unstrike this video after a while...

But it still sucks for the whole duration of it staying struck..</div>

The problem is there’s no structure holding anything together. No shared understanding of how features are supposed to work, no trail of decisions and no clear outcomes. What made perfect sense while building becomes hard to explain even a week later.

Have teh AI develop a detailed spec with you and then keep that spec in you custom instructions so you are always building to it.   Manage the spec deliberately when you change it.   You can also ask the AI about the strength and weaknesses of you plan and incorporate better ideas.   Definitely helpful to do this up front if you are experienced.  If you aren’t just figure you’re going to need to rebuild the system several times as you mature it and learn what it ‘really’ needs to do so scale and support users.</div>

If you are simply telling Cline, “refactor this” it’s going to obliterate what other people have worked on. There is a need to be very explicit within each file or directory along with responsibility of the user. This then followed by commit reviews, etc. It’s definitely not optimal, but it’s also not meant to be a 1 click solution. Manual intervention is key here.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">AI is a tool. It doesn't turn you into a programmer any more than Excel turns you into an financial analyst. If you're writing professional software, you need a professional software developer. Is your software written by an amateur secure? How would they even know? They wouldn't even know what vulnerabilities to tell the AI to protect them from. They couldn't identify glaring issues that a professional developer would immediately recognize. 

I work for a high-end tech consulting firm. We use LLMs extensively for everything from designing systems to writing code to reviewing the code they write. We don't "vibe code", though. I could spend anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours putting together a very detailed prompt with extensive context of code examples, payload and response messages from APIs, or whatever. It frequently saves me days of writing code. 

But I still need to review every line of code and understand exactly what it's doing so I can say, "Hey, that's not what I want," or "that's stupid. That definitely needs to go."  If you're not a programmer, you can identify this stuff.

So I don't feel threatened at all, as a professional, by people vibe-coding. It's great if you want to write tools for yourself or little apps, but if you're going to try to compete professionally, you're building a house of cards.</div>

You probably don't need to use AI to check security at a conceptual level, so may not have tried. How effective do you think AI is at tutoring/guiding people through sensible and structured security architectures? I appreciate it's the unknown unknowns that may catch people out, but I suspect that there are also some established best practices that AI will likely have meaningful training data on.</div>

Eventually coding LLMs will have more features built in to test and implement every aspect of software engineering. We are still at surface level with this tech. As the tool improves the less the user has to rely on outside sources to check for things. So no, your job is not “safe” by any means. Only way for you to stay “safe” is to level up to a more science based role and to invent new architecture that can be implemented with the current tech. 

Software development for apps will be in the hands of someone that doesn’t require a degree in computer science, but perhaps a prompt engineering degree or software creation, all of which doesn’t require deep software engineering principles.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes, beginners coding is fun until you have to scale. These were the same problems junior and mid devs were encountering as they grew their skills and expanded their projects even before AI.

It's a skill issue. You tackle it by talking to seniors about your code, or even learning yourself if you're above average in intelligence. The difference is that you now have an infinitely patient senior in your IDE. 

These behaviors should be encouraged by service providers and extensions in their documentation. Like, how to actually use it.

Always be chatting about your codebase, ask questions, keep track of the architecture etc. It's of paramount importance that you always know why a certain thing works. Not the syntax or the actual low level stuff, but the general high level architecture: Do the values in your other page update because the interaction in the first page call a function or, are they simply storing a state and the other page reacts to state change? Stuff like that.

You can then make informed prompts and decisions.

When planning decisions, you should always be asking whether this scales and are there any options that scale better. 

I do this on autopilot because it's how wrote code before AI existed, but I learned this by first creating apps that scaled incredibly poorly and had a lot of tech debt. 

At that point I had fully internalized WHY this is necessary, as I experienced the repercussions on my own skin. The devs these days will just get to experience these same repercussions faster.

It's all gonna be fine. We should all just make a concerted effort to let the young'uns know that these issues are real and how to approach learning to avoid them.</div>
