"Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that something so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance, that some thinkers have chosen to see it as a final and clinching proof of the **non-existence** of God.

The argument goes something like this: 

'I refuse to prove that I exist,' says God, 'for proof denies faith, and without faith, I am nothing.' 

'But,' says Man, 'the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.' 

'Oh dear,' says God, 'I hadn't thought of that,' and vanishes in a puff of logic. 

'Oh, that was easy,' says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing."</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's tempting to reduce a person's character to an archetype based on political leaning. Those oversimplifications is tearing the world apart. 

The absolute majority of people are not killing people regardless of how passionate they are about their ideology of choice. It seems that way because the internet is full of people making a lot of money out outrage and it's convincing the public that the world is on the brink of civil war.

Don't fall for it. Most people would rescue any person from a burning car, even if they are wearing a maga or a lgbt shirt. Let alone sacrificing their freedom for killing someone.

People committing these acts are deranged and end up doing shit like this assassination because their brain can't tell the difference between the real world and assholes spewing hate online.

Don't fall for it. I don't know if its a result of a coordinated effort from the powers that be or it is just a consequence of the state of the world but it's in everyone's best interest to keep in mind there is way more in common between everyone than differences.

Remember, while this shit happened the Epstein files release was blocked.  This is a tragedy by all accounts but don't lose sight of what's truly important.</div>

And if used incorrectly, straight-up hallucinates, lol. Who's to say how good Doc is at using it? That's not his field of study. I know ya'll like to think doctors are all geniuses, but their skills aren't necessarily transferable like that.

Not because I don't like clean air, but because you can't even run a tune for ethanol on a tiny 4 cylinder engine since they checksum the tunes now. But you can absolutely buy a 1975 or older whatever you want, swap it with whatever you want, and run a collector plate and you're home free. Generally speaking commercial trucks have far more lax requirements, too.

They used to do just a sniffer test which was fine because tuning a car wouldn't make you fail as long as you had cats. Now people just get Montana plates for their projects.</div>

If you don't mind software from China then there's Trae.

For VS Code extension the best bet is still Github Copilot, not the same quality, but for the price it's worth it.</div>

There's no reason for using Trae (with shady practices and a closed source IDE) when there's other, better free and open source with great reputation such as Cline, Roo Code, Kilo Code and ofcourse VS code with Github Copilot which lately seems to perform better than even Claude Code.</div>

Default position should be that no data may leave the borders—and don’t always trust government to enforce *regulations*, put it in law with teeth. Entities such as EU could have *some* cross border movement but should have robust protections (EU doesn’t have best track record on this though).

Sure let US companies come in to *run* the data centers, but the operations should be controlled by locals. Some sensitive data should never be controlled by companies with foreign ownership. But also ensure citizens have control over their own data.</div>

we're going to eventually get to a point where we are trying to make better humans with immunity to all disease or virus, no more handicap, with a high IQ, etc. that these imbeciles will still say that they'd prefer have their childrens to be born with less chromosomes than to use this technology because it's "pretending to be god" or someshit, or it's haram or bla blah blah

like it's clearly not thanks to their mentality that we eradicated disease that killed millions of people, those who thought above these cults who crave knowledge gave us science not these mentality limited and primitive view of life, in fact their cults prevented all of this technology and knowledge to be discovered earlier and yet they want from us to let people have miserable life by being mentally challenged, handicapped or by being uglier than quasimodo ? good thing humanity will eradicate these cults in the future that have existed for millenia's, given enough time of course</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Are they talking about in vitro gametogenesis, or an alternate path?

Either way, the point for them is clear. More than 10% of their people are already born from IVF, and the biggest roadblock in IVF is embryo creation. Their birth rate is low too. Boost the success, lower the health burden, and decrease the cost of embryos, and they will see an uptick in births. Not to replacement or anything crazy like that, but maybe a solid 0.1 improvement in TFR. This is one of the best national investments they can make.

Of course, improving embryo creation also enables substantial embryo selection. Probably not their goal, but it'll happen regardless.</div>

I have plus and my experience is 5 auto/fast is absolute garbage but 5 Thinking is excellent.

The fact that this is the standard of intelligence I now expect from my cell phone/laptop is ridiculous. Everything I want to do, it can help. Most of the time, me + gpt &gt; me alone. 

The limit increase + memory + operator integration to search web well is just a phenomenal user experience. 

I slept on GPT 5 because the benchmarks were lacking, but my experience with it has been anything but. Professionally, personally, everything....</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’m surprised you think there aren’t hallucinations. I have been heavily using GPT5 to help prepare and practice for research/ML/SDE job interviews and it hallucinates heavily. Whenever I point it out, it chalks it up to “being sloppy” - it’s just straight up wrong! 

It feels on the level of undergrads I’ve mentored - capable enough and able to google, but unreliable and frequently makes mistakes. And this is for “scoped out” problems that have searchable/textbook answers, for more novel open ended reasearchy problems it’s a lost cause. 

I suspect this is why the annotation companies are all looking for phd+ talent to annotate for them now, the skill ceiling is past the undergrad level but not quite at the phd level.

I can elaborate on the types of problems it can and can’t seem to crack if anyones interested. I have a pretty rich set of examples due to having used it so much lol</div>

* “Over the past year I’ve taken on A, B, and C responsibilities, which are typically part of higher-level roles.”

Also, if a company can pay more, but just... doesn't... is that on you for not asking right, or is something else going on?
It's a lot to think about. Is there a point where chasing "market value" just becomes another kind of trap?</div>

Instead, it's simply a claim you make backed by the scope of your role and value you add. Make it a range from low (your target) to high (just for show) to give your counterpart a feeling of being a great negotiator by bringing you down to the low end (which was your goal from the start).


The key though is walk away point: If you can walk (outside offer, you don't care about the job, fire, etc), you can negotiate hard as you have good alternatives. If you cannot walk (no alternative to this job), you can ask but you have no real leverage.


In the end, compensation is not a mathematical problem where inputs lead to the right outputs. Instead it's an obscure gauging of market dynamics (supply demand for your role in your location) and leverage.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is why asking for a raise nowadays is scary. It automatically labels you as a flight risk exactly like you said which a lot of the time can make you a target to get laid off if you stay. Companies have made it so that it really is no safe way to ask for a raise if you need/deserve one. 

Ask for one: they'll think you're unhappy and planning on leaving if told no. 

Presenting a competing offer letter with a higher salary: They'll again assume you're looking to leave and probably fire you after giving you the raise. 

Even if you only got a competing offer to have some leverage, they won't care and will dispose of you when it's convenient for them. 

Maybe I'm just cynical but it really doesn't seem like you can win anymore. Hence, why people just leave for another job when they want more money. Even if they like their company/boss.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Being seen as a flight risk is another way to say "key employee who needs to be retained." 

If you're easily replaceable than the risk to the company if you "fly away" is very low. 

Replacing any employee takes training and causes downtime, so everyone has a *little bit* of leverage. But if that's all you've got, this advice isn't for you anyway.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">To use those 1700 terrawatt solar power you would need to cover the earth and intercept all sun light.

That would be the end of photosythetic life ... like all plants, all cyano bacteria and all marine phytoplankton.

Those form the basis of the food chain of nearly every ecosystem... that would be the end of life as we know it. Worse than the worst mass extinction in earths history.

Or... we can do something less destructive to get 1700 terrawatts, and utilize the approx. 30 grams of deuterium in every cubic meter of sea water (thats only \~0.003% of sea water).

1 gram deuterium contains 3\*10\^23 deuterium atoms, and 2 deuterium atoms fused together produce one helium atom, one hydrogen atom and 3 MeV of energy. Helium is the most inert noble gas and completely harmless. Hydrogen can be burnt into pure water. All the while 99.997% of the sea water remains unchanged.

Thats 30 \* 3 \* 1.5 \* 10\^23 MeV or 2.25 Terrajoules of energy per cubic meter of sea water (375 times more than a barrel of oil).

Thats 2.25 \* 1000 \* 1000 \* 1000 TJ, or 2250 Exa Joules per cubic kilometer.

Considering the volume of earths oceans is 1.3 billion cubic kilometers, there is a total of 2 925 000 000 000 Exa Joules of energy reserves in earths ocean deuterium. That is thousands of times more than all coal, oil, gas and uranium reserves combined.

That is enough to deliver 1700 terrawatts of power for the next 54 million years, by only using 0.003% of sea water, without destroying life.

It’s easy to think “I’ll do it tomorrow” but tomorrow never comes until something breaks. Now I set my phone to automatically back up everything to the cloud and I also keep a copy on my computer once in a while. It takes a few minutes, but it saves you from the stress and regret of realizing years of memories are just gone.</div>

I had recorded the sound of it on my phone from my mother's phone, which of course her phone broke too before we saved it elsewhere. I even lost my whole teenage life on my old iPod touch when it broke and I lost access to my iCloud. Make multiple copies and multiple back ups, both cloud storage and physical/local storage.

So I decided to generate some random variations and send it over to them to see what they think.

they were amazed with the results.

Word of warning It can't do exact pantone, colours or anything, but it's pretty good to get a general look on what some basic colours would feel like.

Which it did, but it made the headboard like 60% of the size. So I asked it to make it bigger. Fail. Can you make it 30% bigger.  Error.  Can you make it the width of the bed.  Does not compute.

He is comparing o1-preview, which was thinking for a very short amount of time to current models which are thinking way harder and doing wider search than o1-preview. And yes current models can think for minutes or even up to an hour with research:

&lt;short_description&gt;A vibrant yellow and blue round cake featuring a Minion character.&lt;/short_description&gt;
&lt;long_description&gt;This delightful round cake is expertly decorated to resemble a popular Minion character. The top surface is a bright, textured yellow, meticulously piped to create the Minion's skin, complete with two large, expressive eyes featuring brown irises and white pupils. Black goggle straps encircle the eyes, and a cheerful black smile is etched below. A few strands of black "hair" add character to the top. The sides of the cake are adorned with contrasting blue frosting, reminiscent of the Minion's overalls. It's an ideal choice for a child's birthday, a themed party, or for any fan of the Despicable Me franchise.&lt;/long_description&gt;

Furthermore, I have reservations on if I'd even find it fun to begin with. Like I'm not sure I'd truly enjoy getting attacked by monsters, being covered in gore, and fighting for my life. Sounds like the kind of thing we built society to avoid doing in the first place. Not to mention sleeping in shitty taverns and everyone smelling like ass all the time. Of course we could just cheat all that inconvenience out of the simulation but at that point you are just playing a video game which is not living at all.</div>
