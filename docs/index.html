But people on here are claiming that chatgpt is better than top level human programmers, meanwhile you ask chatgpt a simple coding question and it gives you 25 different versions of an answer that doesn't even compile, let alone work.</div>

The UK government has unveiled a revolutionary AI tool that promises to transform the country's outdated planning system and accelerate the delivery of desperately needed housing. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the breakthrough at London Tech Week, revealing plans to digitise decades of planning documents and slash bureaucratic delays that have long plagued development projects.

## AI assistant 'Extract' to modernise paper-heavy system

The new AI assistant, dubbed "Extract," has been developed by the government in partnership with Google, utilising the tech giant's advanced Gemini model. The tool represents a fundamental shift away from England's heavily paper-based planning system, which currently processes around 350,000 applications annually through manual validation by planning officers.

In pilot trials across three councils – Hillingdon, Nuneaton &amp; Bedworth, and Exeter – Extract demonstrated remarkable efficiency gains. The AI tool successfully digitised planning records and maps in just three minutes each, compared to the 1-2 hours typically required for manual processing. This dramatic improvement means Extract could potentially process around 100 planning records per day, representing a quantum leap in productivity.

## Addressing the planning bottleneck

The current planning system remains heavily reliant on handwritten documents and paper maps, some stretching to hundreds of pages. Planning officers spend an estimated 250,000 hours annually manually checking these documents – time that could be redirected toward actual decision-making and speeding up the housing delivery process.

"For too long, our outdated planning system has held back our country – slowing down the development of vital infrastructure and making it harder to get the homes we need built," said Prime Minister Starmer. "With Extract, we're harnessing the power of AI to help planning officers cut red tape, speed up decisions, and unlock the new homes for hard-working people."

## Nationwide rollout planned

The government plans to make Extract available to all councils across England by Spring 2026, with the ambitious goal of fully digitising the planning system by the end of 2026. The rollout forms a crucial part of the government's Plan for Change milestone to build 1.5 million homes over the next Parliament.

Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary Angela Rayner emphasised the transformative potential: "By using cutting-edge technology like Extract we can fix the broken planning system, cut delays, save money, and also reduce burdens on councils to help pave the way for the biggest building boom in a generation."

## Industry backing and transparency gains

Google DeepMind Co-Founder and CEO Demis Hassabis welcomed the collaboration, noting that their AI models are designed to understand diverse information types, from text to handwritten notes and technical drawings. The partnership demonstrates the potential for public-private cooperation in modernising government services.

Significantly, the planning data unlocked through Extract will be uploaded to a publicly accessible gov.uk service page, ensuring greater transparency and public access to planning information. The government is also exploring the development of mobile applications that could scan documents instantly.

## Economic impact and broader context

The digitisation effort builds on existing investments, with councils already spending an estimated £59.4 million annually on digital planning and housing software. The Extract initiative is projected to deliver time and cost savings of £527 million for the public sector each year.

The AI tool launch comes alongside other government efforts to accelerate development, including 18 planning decisions already taken by Ministers since July, with over 85% completed within target timeframes. Major approvals have included airport expansions, data centres, solar farms, and significant housing developments.

The upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill will provide additional powers to fast-track critical infrastructure projects, including wind farms, power plants, and major transport links.

Local authority leaders have expressed enthusiasm for the technology. Hillingdon Council's Chief Operating Officer Matthew Wallbridge noted that "the productivity benefits will allow for a faster and cheaper service," while Tom Shardlow from Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council highlighted the potential for creating "high quality, digital, GeoSpatial data" to improve planning services.

As the UK grapples with a significant housing shortage, this AI-powered approach to planning reform represents a bold attempt to use cutting-edge technology to address one of the country's most pressing challenges. The success of Extract could serve as a model for other government departments seeking to modernise their operations and improve service delivery for citizens.</div>

Which is the point. I live and work here too and without the coverage, I would have no idea anything was going on. Business as usual. The media wants people to think the city is an apocalyptic hellscape, but it is not even close. 

I see the shit on social media from people who don't live here saying LA is falling to the migrant invaders and all this made up bullshit lol. It's ridiculous.</div>

Its been overwhelmingly a calm protest but they desperately want fires and explosions for their own ratings.

                                <div class="reply-body">This is why many of us in the western world say Americans are some of the most propagandized people on earth. 

Every time I visit, your news is bizarre and your commercials are filled with prescription drug ads; yall realize most of the world isn’t like that right? South Park does an amazing job of making fun of America tbh.

Ironically when trump says “fake news”, it’s one of the rare times he’s telling the truth. 

I hope you guys are able to figure things out and take back your country from the billionaires and corporations instead of fighting each other. It’s unsettling seeing a strong nation decline so drastically in one’s lifetime. </div>

Your perspective works for vibe coders and other unskilled users. Raw coding power is king. Google doesn't need your money, they don't need to give vibe coders extra tools when people who know what they're doing will find their own set of existing tools.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Basically means, the first thing to achieve what he (and probably some other people) describe as AGI, will be not just a single model like... Gemini-5 or whatever, but a whole app built around this. Probably with systems for managing tools, security and interaction with banks, the ability to control your devices, probably multiple different memory like systems and most likely more than one ML model working in concert - some things tied to RL verification I'm thinking. 

That being said, I think the second "thing" to be called AGI will just be a model that handles all of that with better architecture.</div>

99% of the time you’re watching some Apple WWDC video where they are forced to behave like robots and not go a single word off script, they even dictate how they can stand and move their hands.

They rarely do off the cuff, free speaking interviews like this</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">And there's a reason for that lol. Whether you are Apple or Microsoft or DickFuck LLC it's not optimal to answer unscripted questions because someone hits you with a question that has no good answer and you're trapped. Like here where she says "Siri should be better than the competition" and Craig says "that's our goal" and she says, "but it's not, right?"

That's a horrible position as an executive to be in. If you are brutally honest and say "yeah Siri is way behind, we need to do better" the headlines will not be kind to you, it will be "Apple admits Siri is worse than competition". But if you try to dodge saying that it also looks bad.

If the broader market rewarded honesty and candidness things would be different but I don't think most people appreciate honesty (maybe you and I would, but most consumers would not). Admitting wrongdoing is poison to most business.</div>

For a tech interviewer, it looked like she doesn’t know what’s a LLM or what’s ChatGPT…</div>

Apple is not the company its fans want it to be.

Without Steve Jobs, the company has no real vision and is just trying to force fit  new tech innovations into products with no compelling reason for why.</div>

However, their website provides no way to cancel the subscription or remove my card information. They also don't respond to email support. So now they're happily charging 10 euros per month from my account, and the only way I can stop it is by contacting my bank directly.

I read that the company was acquired by Cursor, and it seems they're pretty much dead now.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thanks for this recommendation. Actually, it's what I've done. I have a dedicated card for services I don't trust, and I keep this card frozen when I'm not using it. Still, they're trying to charge it every few days, so as soon as I forget to freeze it, they take the money. But regardless, the gist of the problem is that we can't cancel the subscription, and their support team is not helping. I wanted to warn people so they don't get trapped.</div>

The 4 port are 1000000% underpowered but the 6 port was perfect. 232hp vs the 252hp of the TURBO Rx7? Yeah dope, if the emissions regulations hadn’t fucked the wankle engine im sure we would have seen less warranty numbers from blown engines because they wouldn’t have reduced the number of oil squirters to barely make emissions on these cars. Also better advertising or something to teach people how to take care of the engines would have helped too.</div>

In a perfect world, it shouldn't be an issue, but sadly there is still heavy prejudice (just yesterday Southern Baptists at their annual convention made overturning the Supreme Court's decision on gay marriage a top priority.)

They were super nice and had to be at a booth appearance but were super nice about. Later that afternoon, like literally 5-6 hours later Alec spotted me walking around f the vendor village and asked if I still wanted to get that photo. He was super nice. I remember when he made this announcement, I was a bit nervous, considering the more vocal conservative side of the CrossFit.</div>

For example, if you are really into the NFL then only allow yourself to watch the games WHILE you are at the gym. During the football season this forces me to go to the gym every Monday, Thursday, and Sunday. The same concept applies to Netflix series. You can reserve your watching times to only when you are on the treadmill, elliptical, etc....</div>

I was kinda surprised by how explicit some of the things he wrote were - but then, in the middle of the scene in chapter 41, seconds after generating another explicit scene it refused the next prompt(which was simply to continue with the same pace and style, adding maybe one or two twists). After 40 nsfw chapters it decided that generating nsfw is against its' policy. Why?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This just makes sense as the path forward, and I imagine lots of labs are moving this way. Predicting in embedding space is going to be more compute efficient, and also it’s closer to how humans reason. They didn’t say it, but I’d imagine the loss flows backwards through the whole system, so that a good learned embedding is one that enables good predictions after decoding. 

Really feeling the AGI with this approach, regardless of current results using the system.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Especially if the embeddings can be expressed by an LLM later. It would be a way for LLMs to finally have an actual sense of physicality that would enhance their reasoning skills.

All the weird "thought experiment" benchmarks and puzzles that LLMs fumble on because they don't have enough sense of physical space could be solved by having an internal world model in their embeddings that express physicality.</div>

I imagine it would make training harder not to, you'd need to keep training the encoder on its original task, otherwise it could just output the same embedding for every frame to cheat the system</div>
