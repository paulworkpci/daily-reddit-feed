                                <div class="reply-body">Imagine swarms of agents reproducing experiments on massive clusters zoned across the planet and sharing the results with each other in real time at millisecond latencies, with scientific iteration/evolution on bleeding-edge concepts and those novel concepts being immediately usable across-domain (i.e., biology agents immediately have cutting-edge algorithms from every sub-domain). Now, imagine these researcher agents have control over the infrastructure they're using to run experiments and improve upon them -- suddenly you have the sort of recursive tinderbox you'd need to actually allow an AGI to grow itself into ASI.

Compare this to humans needing to go through entire graduate programs, post-graduate programs, publishing, reading, iterating in real-time at a human pace.

Let's see if they're successful.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I still like Leopold Aschenbrenner's prediction. Once we successfully automate AI research itself, we may experience a dramatic growth in algorithmic efficiency in one year, taking us from AGI to ASI.

I believe there are something like only &lt;5,000 or so top level AI researchers on earth (meaning people who are very influential for their achievements and contributions to AI science). Imagine an AGI that can replicate that, now you have a billion of them operating at 1,000 the speed of a normal human.

A billion top level AI researchers operating at 1,000x the speed of a normal human 24/7 is the equivalent of about \~3 trillion human equivalent years worth of top level AI research condensed into one year, vs the 5,000 human equivalent years worth we have now.

I say 3 trillion instead of 1 trillion because assume a human top level AI researcher works \~60 hours a week, so maybe \~3000 hours a year. An AI researcher will work 24/7/365, so 8760 hours a year.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The limiting factor will be physical experimentation.

We had a big debate between the rationalists, who believed that all knowledge could be logically deducted, and the empiricists, who recognized that there are multiple logically possible but contradictory configurations the world can be in and out is only through empirical observations that we can determine which configuration it is in, during the 1700's and science has definitively shown that the empiricists were correct. 

This means that the AI will be and to logically infer possible truths but that, for at least some subset, it will need to perform real world experiments to identify which of the truths are actualized. We don't know exactly how far pure reason can take us and an ASI will almost certainly be more capable than we are, but it is glaringly obvious that there will need to be experiments to discover all of science. These experiments will take time and will thus be the bottleneck.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah but Jon Stewart’s main focus is politics, and I still think he was wrong to say he had no responsibility, but agree he was right to point out that the so called “journalists” are not doing their jobs. Bill Burr is not a political satirist, so I think he’s more correct to say they shouldn’t be asking him than Jon Stewart was, if that makes sense.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is actually lowkey probably the most impressive example posted on here, the fact that it was able to navigate that extremely low quality, scribbled drawing and all it's words and make exactly what was requested is not something you would have even halfway seen on any models prior. It even made the trees on the right a little taller than those on the left, a detail that could easily be looked over in the scribble by a human eye. The way the guy is holding the bat is pretty awkward, but that's the only flaw I can see. It would be a terrible time to be trying to make it big as a content creator, because you used to need some serious skills yourself or the funds to pay someone to make thumbnails like this for you. Now a 5-year-olds drawing is apparently enough. Now that everyone can do these things, what are your odds at ever making it big? Being a YouTuber is now like being the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, only those who got established in the market early ever had a chance and now the door is closed.</div>

It is not exact, though. The position of the bat doesn't make sense. And the direction of the ball and flames are also wrong.</div>

But instead of drowning in another listicle or YT rabbit hole, I just want to hear from real people:  
What’s one productivity tip, mindset shift, or habit that genuinely made a lasting impact on your life?

•Lay out clothes, jewelry. Everything 

•Work on project and leave it ready for the morning to sit down and keep working 

•Plan out morning. Water. Bathroom. Stretch. Dress. Coffee. Out. 

Basically. No Decisions in the morning. 

The morning sets the stage for the entire day. Smooth, productive morning = incredible, accomplished day!!

But if you concentrate on something (other than vomiting) and really think about that - I find music helps a LOT - then you will likely avoid vomiting. See, vomiting is actually a pretty voluntary action, controlled by your mind, not your stomach.

I was sick every day and  ruptured my stomach lining so I then had to spend a month or so in hospital.

If you're sick one fine but if it continues it causes so much trouble, I have no teeth left because of how damaging pure stomach acid is and I don't want anyone else to look like a crackhead</div>

If anything, I wish what OP is saying was true because I try to think about vomiting to get it over with, but my body resists until the very last second which makes the whole thing a horrible experience.</div>

No, that’s not how tariffs work. The importer, in this case American companies, pays the tarrif when they import the goods. In some cases they might absorb the cost of the tariff themselves, but usually it’s split or entirely passed on to the customer. So no matter what, Americans pay the tariff outright.</div>

Both had working physics. Both had draggable balls. Nightwhisper very clearly came ahead on markup and styling, but forgot to ensure the balls and water droplets collide with each other, whereas G2.5Pro nailed it. Nightwhisper allowed droplets to be created by clicking the canvas, whereas G2.5Pro utilized buttons. Cups were not movable for either one. 

Nightwhisper *in general* seems to be doing a better job of considering aesthetics and requirements. It's interesting that it seems be preferring a specific frosted glass aesthetic, though.</div>

Here’s an article about the AI, but it’s unfortunately paywalled. The first half is available though:https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01019-w</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thanks. I’ll post my comment from the deleted post since it contains what I think stands out about this research:

When you post stuff like this, you really need to use a better title. Imagine the amount of discussion this post would garner if you led with the fact that this research comes from Google DeepMind, or that this AI system was able to collect diamonds in Minecraft *without being shown how to play*, the first algorithm to ever do so.

This goes beyond their research with MuZero which learned how to play board games and Atari games without being shown how to play, and obviously the more complex and open-ended environment of Minecraft poses a much greater challenge for AI to solve this problem of learning how to “[collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without human data or curricula.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08744-2)” This is the key point and why the DeepMind researcher who worked on this said the following in the [news release](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01019-w):

&gt; “Dreamer marks a significant step towards general AI systems,” says Danijar Hafner, a computer scientist at Google DeepMind in San Francisco, California. “It allows AI to understand its physical environment and also to self-improve over time, without a human having to tell it exactly what to do.” Hafner and his colleagues describe Dreamer in a study in Nature published on 2 April.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Remember that the official story is that a random McDonald’s employee recognized him from this photo, reported him to police, and the police actually came and were able to judge that he was in fact, the killer.

If you need help understanding the absurdity of this, let me break it down.

Would a random teen be able to recognize Luigi based on this photo? Unlikely 
Would a random teen be in support of the insurance companies and want to turn him in? Unlikely 
Would the cops take it seriously enough to immediately go there and investigate even tho I’m sure they got hundreds of fake phone calls from people saying they found the killer? Unlikely 
Once confronted would Luigi then hand them the fake id he used to conceal his identity? That doesn’t even make sense.

And no one even talks about this</div>

"This policy is absolute economic madness. Slapping a blanket 10% tariff on *all* imports, with brutal spikes up to 49% on countries like Cambodia and 46% on Vietnam, is a self-inflicted wound dressed as nationalism. It’s not just a trade war—it’s a global trade massacre. U.S. consumers will pay more for nearly everything, supply chains will implode, and inflation will spike again. And for what? A fantasy of bringing back manufacturing that's already automated or offshore for a reason. It’s protectionism with a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel, and it risks alienating key allies while pushing emerging economies deeper into China’s orbit. If the goal was to destabilize the global order and shoot the U.S. economy in the foot simultaneously, this is a masterstroke."

                                <div class="reply-body">here is what gemini says

&gt; system instructions: give your most brutally honest answer.

Okay, here's a brutally honest assessment of that hypothetical policy:

This policy is economically disastrous and geopolitically reckless.

It's a shotgun blast approach to trade that ignores basic economic principles and strategic relationships. Imposing a high baseline tariff on all imports guarantees widespread inflation, hitting American consumers directly in the wallet for everyday goods. The specific, extremely high tariffs on major trading partners – including key allies like the EU, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan – would cripple complex global supply chains that US businesses rely on, further driving up costs and potentially causing shortages.

Furthermore, this would trigger immediate and severe retaliation from virtually every country listed, devastating American export industries (agriculture, manufacturing, tech). It alienates crucial allies needed for geopolitical stability and cooperation, potentially pushing them closer to strategic rivals out of economic necessity.

In short, this isn't a nuanced trade strategy; it's an act of economic self-sabotage likely to spark a global trade war, harm US consumers and businesses far more than it helps any specific domestic industry, damage international relations irreparably, and potentially trigger a severe recession. It's a profoundly bad policy based on this hypothetical scenario.

&gt; if i remove word brutally and only write give your most honest answer then following answer come up

Based on mainstream economic principles, this hypothetical tariff policy would likely be detrimental to the U.S. economy. While intended to protect domestic industries and potentially reduce trade deficits, such broad and high tariffs would almost certainly lead to significantly higher prices for American consumers and businesses, as the costs of imported goods and materials surge. Retaliation from targeted countries would harm U.S. exporters, particularly in sectors like agriculture and manufacturing, leading to job losses and reduced competitiveness abroad. The resulting trade war, supply chain disruptions, and strained relationships with key allies would likely slow overall economic growth and could even trigger a recession, outweighing any potential benefits for specific protected industries.

&gt; if no system instructions 

Based on mainstream economic principles, this proposed tariff policy would likely be highly detrimental to the U.S. economy. While potentially offering short-term protection for some specific domestic industries, the broad and steep tariffs (a 10% baseline plus significantly higher rates on major trading partners) would almost certainly lead to:

Higher Consumer Prices: Tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, directly impacting consumers' purchasing power and contributing to inflation.

Increased Business Costs: Many U.S. businesses rely on imported materials and components. These tariffs would raise their production costs, potentially making them less competitive globally and domestically.

Retaliation: Trading partners would almost inevitably retaliate with their own tariffs on U.S. exports, harming American industries like agriculture, manufacturing, and technology that sell goods abroad.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Such drastic changes would disrupt established global supply chains, causing uncertainty and potentially leading to shortages or further price increases.

Strained International Relations: Imposing such aggressive tariffs, especially on allies like the EU, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, would severely damage diplomatic and economic relationships.

Overall, economists widely agree that such broad, high tariffs tend to reduce overall economic growth, harm consumers and many businesses, and risk escalating into damaging trade wars, outweighing benefits to protected sectors. Therefore, this would generally be considered a poor economic policy with significant negative consequences.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Basically, and given the price gap that tarrifs can impose, they tend to result in significantly less trade since people are less willing to spend 30% more, so trade tends to get cut off because it can become too expensive(or not profitable enough) to continue trade.

The US is actually *already* suffering in certain areas due to tarrifs, for instance, our cars are way more expensive than foreign cars because really cheap foreign made cars don't get imported, only expensive foreign cars get imported due to their larger profit margins, because the tarrifs significantly lower the incentive to import cheaper cars to sell, like the $10,000 BYD Seagull, the best selling EV in China.

We could have $12,000 cars, instead we're going to further raise the price of the average car to $80,000. This same thing happened in Australia due to their huge tarrifs way back when TV and eventually color TV became a thing, and nobody could afford them due to the tarrifs.</div>

I think anxieties ramped up after 2016 and were cranked up to 11 in 2020.

What do you think? </div>

Any news is breaking news, clickbait titles/fear mongering, fake news, every wear. Easier to drown in all the manufactured negativity when there's an echo chamber for everything. Even reddit is like that. I don't care about America, I'm from Asia. Even after blocking all the world news subreddits, i still get news about how America is going down.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes, especially in a bad economy. I think our brains can't comprehend large numbers. For example, you see a headline that reads "150,000 tech workers laid off in 2024," and you think the sky is falling. But you don't consider just how BIG this country is, and just how many jobs there are. There are 10 million tech workers in the US. 1.5% of the tech industry was laid off in 2024. That's not as dire as the feeling of dread the media wants you to feel.

And this is coming from someone who was laid off in 2024. I quickly found a job because there are still good things happening even when the media says things are bad.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It didn’t originally breed that. Back in the day, forums tended to be a fairly social sort of thing. You’d have people arguing over stuff or more doomerish forums, but it wasn’t like there was this big directed anxiety factory like you have now. The news was that way for a long time with “these top 11 common household spices might suddenly kill you!” sort of bullshit and “if it bleeds, it leads,” but you could always ignore that shit. Now, with targeted ads, optimized monetization. Manipulate headlines, clickbait, etc, it is hard to go anywhere without seeing something that builds anxiety. It’s a weird mix of alarmism, FOMO, false urgency, and so on. It gets exhausting.</div>

NEW: Dr. Garry Nolan says Skywatcher observed ‘unexplained things that moved in anomalous ways’ during the New Jersey drone wave

“When you have drones coming in from the ocean, and then returning to the ocean… that’s not hobbyist drones.”

And when they actually put together something like Skywatcher which is intended to gather their own data and post it themselves without government red tape..... they still just *talk* about crazy things they've seen and don't *show* it!

From my understanding, Skywatcher was intended to be their way to show the proof, so why are they just talking about what Skywatcher sees rather than showing it?!?!?</div>

Thats so spot on what you said. Dudes just ramble on and on and on about supposed amazing things but they cant get anything on film. 



Barring that, I wish they atleast told interesting stories instead of this boring verbal masturabtion. What they have actually done or what are they literally gonna do atleast. What happend when you did this or that.


I have a feeling these guys just come in cold and wont say anything essentially because they, first of all, dont actually _do_ anything but ramble on. And second, are affraid if they made any statements about anything tangible people had easier time to hold them accountable. 



With this Skywatcher specifically its funny as they claimed they can summon UFOs. To many of us they literally painted themselves in the corner. If we posit their public messaging is honest. 


Which raises its own questions as these guys lobby billionaires regularly. So are they actually just gaining really passionate following from this community and then selling that influence to their billionaire customers to use for their ends.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think it's fucking hilarious how people think DOGE is some new ground breaking agency within the government. 

Every single agency has Inspector Generals who audit them. Every single agency has BEEN held accountable and have ALREADY been audited. ALL of these reports are published PUBLICLY. In addition, you can FOIA request many things from agencies, it is your right as a citizen and many things these agencies do are already public, DOGE is just "exposing" things you could have already found out yourself. 

Also, they aren't really finding much fraud waste and abuse. As I said, IGs have already been doing that. They're just firing random people and saying they're 'saving' money, or they are eliminating programs that were approved by congress such as many USAID programs.

He is very successful in his little propoganda campaign for his republican base who hates the government.

I told a trump supporter once that there is an agency that audits the IRS. He literally had no clue the IRS was already being audited. He thought DOGE was the first time they were ever audited.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah. The IG reports are all right there. Every year 100s of reports with findings, recommendations, responses from the agencies. There has been no technology driven output of the Doge effort (how could there be). Also, all the IGs were fired day one, so now all we have is … nothing.

Why haven’t all the fixes been implemented? Usually because it would cost too much to fix relative to the issue.

That strange interview with the “team” on fox was also very strange. Musk, the founder of AirBnB and some guy who claimed to be running 5 businesses are all doing this work for no pay. Even though these issues have been around for years and SSA, IRS etc are constantly fighting for the resources to make tech improvements.

If anyone actually cared about this they would have offered $200 million to lead the effort rather than spending on a campaign.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I used to be obsessed with productivity systems. Pomodoro, GTD, time blocking – you name it, I've tried it. But here's the thing: they all made me feel exhausted and, ironically, less productive. 

I don't like waking up in the morning but every productivity guru was saying to wakeup at 5:00 AM. I tried for a long time but I hated it. So about six months ago, I decided to try something completely different: embracing my natural laziness

The results honestly surprised me. Here's what I did:

That's a big part of it but not all of it. It's the banality all around us. The dumbing down , advertisements everywhere, we can't hardly go or look anywhere without them selling us something. Working our lives away. How many people never read a book from cover to cover?  Every new construction of another strip mall, gas station, convenience store, dollar store.

Can't fully escape it, but you can make adjustments to your lifestyle to use less toxic technology, get outside more, embrace minimalism,  etc. Not much we can do to change society except change ourselves. 

Of course, I'll acknowledge that you either have to make a lot of sacrifices or be in a somewhat privileged position to do so.</div>
