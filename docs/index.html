                                <div class="reply-body">It looks like this is a pre-recorded routine using mo-cap. When they hit "play" on the routine there is a jarring transition in posture the robot assumes from the beginning of that routine. Still impressive, but it at least does not appear to be a behavior it is dynamically calculating and executing as much as it is a pre-recorded set of exactly positioned "waypoints" for each motor, if that makes sense. In any case we are getting quite close, and with the new physics engine they used to power that Disney/Nvidia robot I am impressed by both of these and hope to see them implemented for various uses around the world (security through neighborhoods, doing dangerous jobs, with my favorite future use-case being helping to build homes/framing/structures as this will be life changing for all of us).</div>

2. **The CIA's Unchecked Influence**: JFK saw the CIA as deceptive, reckless, and dangerous, particularly after the Bay of Pigs disaster. He aimed to restructure or dismantle it entirely.

3. **The Federal Reserve's Power**: In 1963, JFK signed Executive Order 11110, granting the U.S. Treasury the authority to issue silver certificates, a form of currency backed by silver, o...</div>

Just months before the Kennedy election AIPAC operated under the name AZPCA (American Zionist Committee for Public Affairs.) Some people still seem to get tripped up about AIPAC and zionism and how it's merely serving American interests or whatever the current response to criticism is

Honestly though I think JFK's continued push for inspections on the Dimona reactor at such a critical time in their nuclear weapon development was reason number 1 for his assassination. Reason number 2 was his ambitions to dissolve the CIA which was also of use to Israel due to its close ties (or bold faced corruption and collusion depending on how you view it) to israeli intelligence. AIPAC's status quo was just a happy little side effect</div>

That's when things like the Federal Reserve, the Balfour Declaration, WW1, the Treaty of Versailles all happened.

Soon, you'll have enough water for even the largest items.  Also, if you have to replace it because it's too dirty, you are using less water.

If you are washing a pot or large bowl, put the water in that to start with.

Second, try to wash from clean to dirty.  Save the grossest stuff for last, because it will probably make the water gross ...</div>

So the lady had us use water with pasta residue in it for the first round, and a bit of soap for the second. And the tiny trickle of water we used was unbelievable. Truly a trickle. Time &gt; Money when you’re working on a farm, and maybe that won’t work for people nowadays, but I watch some folks turn on their faucets full blast and it still surprises me.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Personally when i look at reasoning tokens i feel less optimistic that its paradigm shifting. They look rephrasals of the prompt. I think scalingg on data may have made some unusual effects. It feels like models are becoming more and more clever databases with very dynamic search and very few of the paramyers are actually logical, thinking, thought producing parameters, as opposed to recalling. This might be why small models are as good perhaps as big models. I am just waffling. I feel current transformer based, with multi head attention mechanism may have hits its limit. Sure it will ace some tests but its kind of a trick now. It seems current architecture has nailed how humans associate information with previous knowledge. I feel its very far off from replicating how humans iterate over and over to understand new concepts through breaking them down into smaller and smaller components. But who knows frontier labs have something cooking maybe, but current architecture does nail recall and associate part. Maximises computing,s systems advantage over humans, infitnite memory and computation. Also the hallucinations seems to be good indication that models are fundamentally recalling.  Hallucinations are just wrongful recollection like a human. Reasoning helps here by guiding this recalling better thtrough reiterations and rephrasing. So qualitatively it feels better</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think the only way for Boston Dynamics to be competitive in future market is it has to know how to mass manufacturing robots cheaply (they don't know how to do this). And Hyundai is perfect for that. Also, BD shifted towards electric robots after Hyundai bought it. Overall, I think the koreans are very technologically advanced and BD to be a korean company is probably the best since traditional manufacturing firms in the US is bad. And high-tech manufacturing firms develop their own robots.</div>

I have worked with some surgeons who have blindingly fast, impeccably accurate verbal and spatial reasoning as well as seemingly endless reserves of working memory, and who basically cannot countenance the existence of perspectives other than their own. Insofar as there are different kinds of intelligence I guess you could say these guys lack emotional intelligence, but honestly I think they are smart people who are just kind of assholes.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Look how he controls his new Aussie wife. Getting her to go naked at that awards show, getting blowjobs in public in Venice on that water taxi. You can tell he gets off on the control. Look at him watching her strip off at the red carpet for that awards show. 

She must be getting super compensated as you can see she is uncomfortable about it all.

Point is, he loves having that sort of sick control of another human, so what has he got going on that we don’t see?</div>

All Bud Light did was put Dylan Mulvaney on a single case that they gave just to her and weren't even selling. She was just advertising for them, and the right lost their minds. 

In this instance, however, Elon Musk bought our fucking government, is illegally cutting agencies that would regulate gim, stealing all our data, and cutting funding to anything that helps the little guy, including gunning for social security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the fucking VA. It's merciful of the people to just go after his business, imo.</div>

I used to think my best years were behind me. That I'd missed my shot at being in great shape or getting serious about my goals. Turns out, that was just an excuse. The only real difference between now and my 20s? Mindset.

                                <div class="reply-body">A few more things that helped me:

* **Journaling** – Dumping everything onto paper or a journal app. It helps me be less reactive in life.
* **Not taking things personally** – A game-changer for me. Thick skin as they say. 
* **Lifting weights** – I don’t know why, but it has made me mentally tougher.
* **Being part of a community** – Meeting other people and understanding their struggles reminds me that I’m not alone.
* **Sleeping well** – So underrated, but good sleep gives you the energy to handle daily battles.
* **Caring less about what others think** – You have one life. Don’t let other people run your show.
* **Accepting people as they are** – Sounds cliché, but when you accept things as they are, you take a huge weight off your shoulders and focus on solutions instead.

Hope this helps!</div>

I'm 23 and still struggle with some of the flaws of the modern world, but I try to make each day better.

1. Nvidia Blue.

Runs on Newton, an open-source physics engine developed by NVIDIA and Deepmind.

It's so good that it looks like 3d render, but it's actually real.

2. GR00T N1, the world’s first open foundation model for humanoid robots! It learns from the most diverse physical action dataset ever compiled.

Runs the end-to-end neural net with 2B parameters.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’m really sorry to hear about everything you’ve been going through. It’s so tough to be caught in that cycle of burnout, especially when jobs in engineering demand so much mentally. It sounds like you’ve been doing all you can to regain balance, and that takes so much strength, even if it may not feel like it right now.

I went through something similar a few years back when my work-life balance went haywire, and what helped me was reassessing what truly fuels me, both in work and in downtime. Even simple moments of joy or calm can make a difference. I started small, like allowing myself time to listen to heartfelt audio inspirations I personalized to my goals and mood. It sounds simple, but having that moment of peace and reflection can sometimes create a shift, helping ease the brain fog just a little.

While you’ve been trying self-help, maybe consider integrating elements that align directly with where you are right now. Rather than forcing productivity, nurturing rest and motivation through those small inspirational nudges might offer a different perspective on rebuilding your energy levels.

Have you found any small rituals or moments that provide even a flicker of calmness or clarity? Sometimes they emerge from unexpected places, and leaning into them can start to spark brighter change. I’d love to hear what your small anchors have been, if any come to mind.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thank you for the thoughtful reply. I can feel relatively calm when I don't think about work and don't force myself to code or look for jobs or be productive. Ironic given how I spent my life focusing on productivity. I find myself at my best when I read self-help books or listen to audiobooks or videos about manifestations, energy and such topics, perhaps because it gives me hope that maybe someday I will be able to make a living without being a software engineer or suffer at work. I also find moments of peace when looking at inspiring art, or have the time to read/write fiction and engage my imagination. So basically non mentally exhausting activities.

Unfortunately, the above only make me feel okay when I don't work or think about work. I only allowed myself this luxury for a week into my unemployment and then went back to trying to look for jobs and code, which I've been doing for more than a month now (excluding days of complete body shutdown due to fibromyalgia in between) and still fail. My brain fog just gets so much worse and I feel overwhelmed beyond words. When I'm overwhelmed, I can't enjoy anything, so any activities that used to bring me joy feel useless. Sometimes I feel relief when I take a warm shower or listen to nice music despite work, but it's still very fleeting and pain and fogginess takes over very quickly.

May I ask whether you were able to pull yourself out of burnout and regain your mental capacity? If so, was there anything else that helped you besides focusing on what brings you joy?</div>
