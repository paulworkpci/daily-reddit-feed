                <div class="post-content">Tibetan monks in neuroscience studies showed dramatically reduced brain activity in areas linked to suffering while exposed to pain. The subjects practiced a specific meditation technique for only 5 months, which reduced their brain's receptivity to pain by 50 percent. One can only imagine a monk that practices it for 10 years.

Suffering is the mental and emotional reaction to pain. It’s how we interpret pain. By modifying our intepretation of it, we can mostly avoid suffering.

                        <div class="comment-body">I appreciate the line of reasoning here but it should be pointed out that this post is a bit misleading because these studies exclude major factors outside meditative practice alone which monks depend on to achieve emotional and mental well-being. 


Monks don't develop meditation alone they develop the entire range of the Eightfold Path and success in it is contingent on the degree to which ethical and empathetic criteria are developed.


The emotional and mental well-being which monks possess is predicated on ethical and empathetic development first and foremost as the basis from which meditative capacity and effectiveness will grow. 


It is actually the cultivation of sila, virtue which is the source of well-being and meditation capacity is what results from that.



In short, a person with a meditative practice alone will not benefit to the extent as a person who combines a form ethical/empathetic development as a basis on which meditative practice is developed.


Ethics/empathy + meditation = emotional &amp; mental well-being


I hope framing it in this way is helpful in understanding how sustained well-being is developed.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">They also have all of their basic needs met before any of the mental strength training begins. Put the Dalai Lama in long term homelessness, terrorise them and young children in their care, remove their ability to act autonomously and you'll soon see them failing. Suffering isn't all of your basic needs being met, it's a normal response to the consistent pattern of intentional refusal to provide safe access to basic needs.

This post is simply amplifying privilege which is denying reality of the vulnerable. We would all love to sit in a monastery on a mountain and meditate or pray all day.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">As an experienced meditator, i can point out one of the most common ways people experience this transmutation of suffering from pain into joy and peace from pain. Ask anyone who has gotten into fitness. It sucks at first, you have to force yourself to do it, and its excruciating in the process and recovery but as you adjust to it, not only does the pain stop causing suffering, it becomes exhilarating and you start to crave it or atleast accept it as part of the experience. Any sensation physical or emotional can have this transmutation through the right mental work.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Same. As a respiratory therapy practitioner in an icu, I feel a lot of the general public have no idea what it actually means when it goes sideways with yr health.  I'm not talking just being on a ventilator to help you breathe, bec you can't,  and with not being able to wean u off, then you're trached and connected to this machine forever. So then, you go to an acute vent unit to try to get u off vent, but its very hard. It's very hard for a healthy 25 year old, let alone someone older. Lots of systems start to fail. Your kidneys go, its called AKI or acute kidney injury, and yr on dialysis bec yr kidneys are shot. Then, of course you can't eat, bec of a variety of reasons, so u get a feeding tube . Which are not great, they get clogged, they get infected. Then the bed sores bec you can't move, and bec there is not enough staff to turn you. And its painful.  Everything hurts.
I'd say half of the patients are aware, and in their right mind, and are terminal, and express they want to die daily.
Now. 
You tell me, how it's ethical,  as humans to watch a person like this linger in pain, and deteriote slowly, painfully. 
Because I see it with my eyes. I watch it every night I'm at work.  And honestly,  I question a lot of what we're doing. We're not helping these ppl get better. We're torturing them. 
These are the patients im advocating this for.</div>

Many people waiting months or even years for a check up. MAID is definitely solving the "problem". And it goes more deeper than that. Is not just for severely, no way to survive, sick people. It's also for mental issues, where people feeling depressed and suicidal, they can book an appointment too. Oh, and they also have
"The MAID Activity Book for Children". This is sick and evil country.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yea this weekend has been rough between this and Torian Pro. Torian always does a great show but I am not going to stay up overnight to watch it and now have no way to view it in the States.

This Sevan crew claims to be all about growing and saving CrossFit. Perhaps they are. But, I think we will look back and realize they were the entirely wrong people for that job. They speak for a loud minority. The negativity and brashness of that crew is not what is needed for CrossFit to prosper. Hopefully, they can realize that before it is too late.</div>

We’ll probably get Day 2 tomorrow. On the other hand, Syndicate is plain awful. Horrible streaming, no proper coverage or camera angles. Just one camera angle and we are forced to watch douche bags commentating in the bottom corner.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed. I think one of the biggest things the SC guys did poorly was doing their homework/preparing for the role. I get it if you don’t have the education or experience of a professional and don’t want to fit the bill of, say, Sean Woodland, but at least having some basic organization and skills to work on can go a long way.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think the advanced metric stuff being incorporated is some of the best analytical content that’s ever been provided for a broadcast but the actual personalities speaking behind the camera are a 12 year olds idea of what “edgy” commentary is.  There’s flashes of really solid coverage in there but not nearly enough to make up for the amount of cringe worthy comments they feel are appropriate.  They’ve just had their worst impulses humored by fans for too long and it just turns the broadcast really unprofessional and at times crass.</div>

I was a hardcore raver in the 90s and seen what it does.  Daily MDMA with Ketamine and shrooms is a grind.  Basically candy flipping with MDMA and shrooms and Ketamine to come down.  I've seen it destroy people the addiction.  I'm not a fan of his personally but he better check himself in rehab</div>

When you abuse drugs every day you do t even realize how intoxicated you are, it feels normal.

This isn't the 1950s, where it was someone unusual to move out from your hometown/state. Everyone I have known my age has moved many times, criss crossing the country. 
That seems real annoying to get a new phone number each time to...what? Fit in with the new ZIP code?</div>

I've had to do it twice because for the first 11 years out of college I worked sales jobs and had a work phone and just never bought a personal phone. Job hopped twice, had to change numbers twice.

Have a friendly chat with the proprietor about the weather, latest news, whatever. Describe your problem. Watch him nod sympathetically. “Ayuh, we can fix that for you. We’ll give you a good deal, too. What’s your num-bah?”

Say, “Area code . . .” and then anything other than “207” (even “area code” is enough, since Mainers only ever give seven digits in their phone numbers). Watch the light leave his eyes, and with it, your “good deal.” Don’t bother trying to explain that you’ve lived here for 15 years. Don’t bother saying that you grew up here, in fact, and you just happen to be at college in Massachusetts when you got your first phone. Just hang your head and shuffle out and hope he doesn’t screw you too bad on the bill.

And while your car is being fixed, head to the nearest Verizon store and change your damned number.</div>

It is making me feel worried that sooner or later she's not going to think anymore for herself and let AI do all the thinking and take all the decisions for her as if it's a perfect futuristic being.

It’s valid to be concerned, but using tools like ChatGPT doesn’t necessarily mean someone stops thinking—many people use it as a starting point, not a substitute, for their own ideas. You might try gently encouraging her to share her own thoughts before turning to AI, so it becomes more of a collaborative tool than a crutch.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">First you have to download the app "google ai edge gallery" and there are options to choose (Ask image, Prompt Lab, AI Chat). I tried Prompt Lab, there were several gemma models to choose 1.1B to 4B. (557Mb to 4.4Gb)

  
I tried it, most of the shorter model hallucinate(starts typing gibberish or random numbers) after writing a short para. And the larger model was running very slow with a very high latency generating tokens very slowly (I don't have a good phone).  
As of now I don't think there would be any use of this model as they hallucinate a lot.

But as they will make the model small in future and optimize the inference part it will be very useful for people in remote locations, people going for hiking, trekking etc</div>

I suspect because it's OS is relatively light and it's got 8GB of memory. It's not even using the GPU or NPU to accelerate on it yet.  
The largest model even generates decent (for an LLM) C# code in my tests, a bit better than ChatGPT 3.5.

I suspect that Apple's miserly attitude to memory on phones is/will be their main problem with Apple Intelligence.

Looking forward to seeing how fast it runs on my Lenovo Y700 2023 that arrives tomorrow.  
Do hope they will release larger Gemma 3N models and a desktop OS runtime that can leverage GPUs.</div>

Folks just reading reports and nodding their heads while providing nothing of real value.

 Those are the jobs being "replaced"... because they shouldn't have existed to begin with. 

This is just an excuse to do cleanup that should have happened regardless.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree with the first part.
But there are def jobs being lost (others being created too), in copywriting, in translation, SEO, and is not necessarily because AI can do it, but because now one person can output a lot more work with the help of AI, does less necessity for as many as before..
Entry level programing jobs have decreased too, not because AI can completely replace a an entry level programmer, but because another with AI can do the job of 2 or 3..

3D product visualisation, less jobs too, as AI is used to generate backgrounds (that would take hours before), so now, 1 3D designer can do the job of multiple..
And the market does adapt, but AI is going evolving really fast, and you have to update at a much faster pace to keep up with new jobs or expectations.

If we don’t do something now it’s gonna be too late as once u don’t need human workers anymore the normal person has no leverage against the people who own ai companies and data centers</div>

It’s made me suspicious of my students, and I hate feeling like that because most of them don’t deserve it.

Like, in my lifetime the changes in the world have been incredible… Flying is the worst because people come back from flights and they tell you…a horror story…They’re like: “It was the worst day of my life. First of all, we didn’t board for twenty minutes, and then we get on the plane and they made us sit there on the runway…” Oh really, what happened next?  
  
Did you fly through the air incredibly, like a bird?  
Did you partake in the miracle of human flight you non-contributing zero?!   
  
You’re flying! It’s amazing! Everybody on every plane should just constantly be going: “Oh my God! Wow!” You’re flying! You’re sitting in a chair, in the sky!”

This was literally impossible 3 years ago and you're pissed that it takes 4 minutes.

Or worse the chucklenuts complaining about the machine that can cook out scientific papers that phd's are paid for that would have gotten nobel prizes 20 years ago and making jokes about 6 fingered hands.</div>

No amount of shiny toys and "cool shit" will satisfy humans because that is not what humans are programmed to really care about.  Humans have evolved to care about social bonds small peer cohorts and having the illusion of agency.  All of these things are missing in modern life, that's why we have so many mentally unstable people. Our environment is not conducive to a healthy human being.  Its possible that future technologies might solve these things via virtual environments where people can live out as they really want, but I wont hold my breath seeing as the people in power tend to gravitate towards power seeking behavior that usually fucks the peasantry below them.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">"I was pulling out onto a thoroughfare street from a strip mall parking lot when warning lights appeared on the Charger's instrument panel for the stability control, frontal collision warning system, regenerative braking and more. There was also a short-lived message — it might have been something about the forward collision warning system — and that the car would be in low power mode. This wasn't good. 

I could tell something was wrong because the car accelerated sluggishly. I got the Charger up to the speed of traffic OK, but then I noticed something was very wrong when I slightly lifted off the accelerator. First, the Charger wasn't using any regenerative braking to slow itself down like it should. (In an EV, you typically lift off the accelerator and the car decelerates without using the regular friction brakes.) It wasn't coasting, either. It was, in fact, accelerating.

I watched the speedometer and could tell the Charger was gaining speed at approximately 1 mph per second, even though I did not have a foot on the pedal. "</div>

Apparently there is zero need for technical understanding to be one 


Of course the car won't use regenerative brakes if it just had an aneurism of errors 


First and foremost they'll make sure you won't kill the battery, so less power output (like you also get in a gas vehicle that has an error, look at that) and no recharging of the battery cells whatsoever by the vehicles own systems. So no Regen braking </div>

They have replaced the 12V battery 4 times and even replaced the cars ev battery.

None of this has helped and the car still bricks after being on a wall charger.

I wanted to like this car so so much. It was exactly what I was looking for and I think it looks much better in person. But based on my experience I would tell everyone to avoid this car even with the amazing lease deals. Naturally my dealer won’t work with me to get me out of the car and stellantis engineers have visited the car at the dealer multiple times with no improvements.</div>

Unless you live in one of the few cities where you can hail a ride from Waymo, which is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, it’s almost impossible to appreciate just how quickly their streets have been invaded by autonomous vehicles. 

Waymo was doing 10,000 paid rides a week in August 2023. By May 2024, that number of trips in cars without a d...</div>

It is cheaper and safer than human drivers, who you have to tip and who I have had illegally run red lights, egregiously speed, come to a dead stop on the freeway to look at their map, discuss their 9/11 conspiracy theories, etc etc. 

The only reason not to take Waymo is if you are traveling outside their somewhat limited coverage area or you're going far enough to need the freeway, where they don't yet drive. But otherwise they rule.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A few more key points: 

It’s becoming more popular in the places that it has already conquered even as it pushes into new cities. Earlier this year, it entered Austin, Texas, through a partnership with Uber. This summer, it’s planning to launch in Atlanta. Next on the list are Miami and Washington, D.C. The cars are now mapping Boston, Nashville, New Orleans, Dallas, Las Vegas and San Diego. This past week, the company announced that it’s testing Orlando, Houston and San Antonio. Waymos have even crossed the ocean to begin collecting data in Tokyo. 
And that kind of exponential scaling was made possible by months, years and even decades of incremental steps along the way. 
“Waymo’s growth is a direct result of compounding progress across the company,” Mawakana said. 

The company now has a safety record over more than 50 million driverless miles—the equivalent of driving across America roughly 20,000 times. There are millions of car crashes in the U.S. every year that kill more than 100 people every day, but one terrible accident is all it would take to slam the brakes on Waymo’s momentum. 

Most companies that tried to beat Waymo have given up. Uber and Lyft ditched their efforts to develop self-driving cars. General Motorsscrapped its Cruise robotaxi program. Amazon has Zoox, but Waymo’s most formidable rival in America at this point appears to be Tesla. 
Six years ago, Musk tantalized investors and consumers with his prediction that robotaxis were just a year away. Now it might be a matter of days. His company is planning a June launch of its own ride-hailing service in Austin, where empty Teslas could soon find themselves at traffic lights next to driverless Waymos. 

The two companies have taken radically different approaches to the technology and economics of autonomous cabs. Tesla’s model runs on cameras and AI. In addition to loads of AI, Waymo’s system also relies on maps, sensors and human feedback, which makes it so expensive. The company raised $5.6 billion of funding last year, when Alphabet’s “Other Bets” division, which includes Waymo, reported a $4.4 billion loss. 
“The issue with Waymo’s cars,” Musk said in April, “is they cost way-mo money.” 
“For us, it’s really important to focus on safety and then cost,” Mawakana said on CNBC. “Not cost and then safety.” 
She added: “There’s probably a lot of ways it can be done. But we’re the only ones that have done it.”</div>
