They make fun of themselves constantly. The problem is that many of these 'jokes' about LGBT folk by right wingers are not 'jokes', they're attacks against their identity. Jokes are observations, not attacking people for who they are.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Remember when Rogan had that guest on who went deep into the Russian interference, and he was generally shocked by it. He would then bring that information up in following podcasts because his mind was blown by the revelations, so he would inform future guests of what he learned. It was a great listen and was pretty much focused on Russia’s tactics in disrupting the world.

Cut to 2025, and we are still acting surprised when articles like this come out and no more mention of said tactics on the podcast.

Russia never stopped fighting the Cold War. While we the west are distracted with Tik Tok Videos, celebrity gossip, infighting and Covid wasn’t real BS. Russia kept on cracking on, and here we are.

It was episode #1263 for anyone interested. She gave amazing insight.

Edit. Grammar &amp; Episode #.</div>

I’m not super familiar with their full critique and where it separates from reality, but I remember thinking when Sam Harris interviewed her it was interesting how she got caught up in the Russian interference stuff. She had kids in a school system and anti-vax info started spreading and she did some investigating and sourced it to Russian state actors. I thought the story suggested 1) this stuff can be easily detected if you’re tech literate and 2) the gumption of some random lady is what unraveled an international misinformation campaign. I thought that was fun and inspiring. 

Later I was surprised to discover she worked at the CIA. She claims her relationship to the agency ended years ago but doesn’t talk about what she did for work in the subsequent decade. Which isn’t to say her information isn’t accurate or valuable, but it seems weird to not mention that background given the topic she is now an expert in.</div>

Leave it to Musk to push the Overton window so far, so quickly with his heavy-handed “White Genocide” and Holocaust questioning tactics.

I don’t believe he did it to push the public’s view of the actual events, rather, he did it explicitly to normalize irresponsible AI for personal gain.

Musk as a paperclip maximizer. But he maximizes his own personal freedom of future action at every step. And then he paints a human face on it.

It’s a lot like Kanye, it’s a lot like Trump. Dumb people eat that shit up. It normalizes seeing things being done without principles, and to some degree makes principled approaches appear naïve. It normalizes the worst.

We need to keep the cautious data science approach. If we lose it, we’re fucked.</div>

Unfortunately that’s clearly not enough for them to be sustainable. Their “normal” volume stuff just isn’t that competitive, admittedly save for the Ram trucks, but even those alienate a ton of buyers due to quality concerns.</div>

"During a recent [Reddit Q&amp;A](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ko3tp1/ama_with_openai_codex_team/) with the Codex team, OpenAI VP of Research Jerry Tworek described GPT-5 as the company's next foundational model.

Gemini 2.5 Ultra is likely, given there is an upcoming competition from Grok 3.5 and O3-Pro

It might be surprising to see Genie 3, or an advancement in this area.</div>

Regarding open-source, its not part of the plan at the moment but... it is something I'm looking to do eventually since I am a big fan of open-source projects, so watch this space!</div>

                <div class="post-content">We naturally have “tunnel vision”—our eyes and brain are wired to focus on a central point. That’s just how our physiology works! When you’ve been around something for a long time—like your yard, your street, any familiar setting, or a project you’ve been working on —it can be hard to see it the way a newcomer or client might. Even noticing the beauty of a place you live in can be surprisingly difficult.

Inspired, I immediately built OpenAlpha\_Evolve – an open-source Python framework so anyone can experiment with these concepts.

This was a rapid build to get a functional version out. Feedback, ideas for new agent challenges, or contributions to improve it are welcome. Let's explore this new frontier.

I can practically taste a world where I can show an AI the latest version of Photoshop and it makes me my own version of it, but basically for free, with all the same functions.

I was joking with my friend that maybe one day AI technology will get so good I can show it the latest trailer for a movie that's about to be released and it can generate me a story and film based on that trailer so I don't have to go to the movies and watch their version. I was mainly joking about this but I feel like that could be a reality.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Exactly. Thoughts are like pink elephants. We can't will them from our minds, nor should we, but I do think that's what a lot of people mistake meditation as being about. Great work at embodying the practice and just being with your thoughts, observing them without judgement, and allowing them to float on by. The precision and gentleness of our practice (coming home to our breath when we notice our mind wanders) empowers us to the let go, just as you've experienced and expressed here. That's the heart of the practice. Great stuff.</div>

It's obviously going somewhere, just nobody can agree on exactly where. To think it's not real is actually just delusional.</div>
