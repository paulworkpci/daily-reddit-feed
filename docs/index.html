                        <div class="comment-body">I like motion controls in games a lot, but I don't like being largely limited to sports and party games with relatively low budgets. I started wondering why I couldn't just map motions to buttons and play any PC game by moving. I started begging programmers with relevant apps to implement such a feature, but no one was interested. I had zero knowledge of programming, but eventually decided I had to build it myself, with a lot of help from Claude and ChatGPT.

I built a prototype in little more than a month, which can be found on [Github](https://github.com/StandieControls/BetterJoyMotion) and seen on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_1GiqGPq4o). It worked far better than I ever imagined. I was hoping for a fun way to replay my favorite games, but instead it became my primary and preferred way of playing games in general. My friends also enjoy it a lot.

I am now in the process of making a far more expansive and user-friendly version, although that could easily take another year or two.</div>

This was a passion project for many years. It started out as a single WordPress page with a Gravity Form as a gift for my wife's birthday, and realized it could scale.

I wrote most of this project before ChatGPT was a thing, but have definitely used it to add some features that were a bit above my weight class (which I've since absorbed and understand; I use it largely as a learning tool).</div>

(well you can probably just watch a YouTube video on a career playthrough, but do try it yourself) Just ignore the anime girls and focus on the game mechanics, trust me.

Of course I totally understand if that's not the direction you want to go, I don't know a thing about golfing so your sim is probably a bit too hardcore for me. It sounds silly but I can see a lot of umamusume mechanics making their way into your game.</div>

# Agent Skills

Roo now supports Agent Skills, which are portable skill folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources that the agent can discover and load on demand. This lets you package repeatable workflows and domain knowledge once and reuse them across project...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yeah.. I agree

I am a programmer for 8+ years  
And I don't manually code anymore. ever. It's way more effective and efficient to let the AI write the code. Maybe small edits that's trivial.

I upgraded from a software engineer to an entire IT department-in-one. 

I have no issues doing front-end, backend, architecture, SEO, networking, cloud, IT service, roles and access management, authentication, authorization, blue-teaming, third-party red-team deployment, data warehousing, analytics, hardware assembly, thin client setup, inference setup, CUSTOM AI PIPELINE ARCHITECTURE, automated maintenance, customizing Linux distro's (ublue &amp; nix) and setting up business android phones with extra layers of security FROM THE KERNEL LEVEL!!!

And It's all in one giant monolithic optimized suite. with molecularity where the churn is high and atomic system upgrades for roll-over safety.

And my absolute favorite is how I have turned my old android pixel 6 into a portable emergency response device so that I can manage all the business critical nodes with some secret android and VM sauce.

So every time I hear that people say: "AI is useless". At the beginning I was in AWE!!! Like HOW CAN YOU THINK THAT AI IS USELESS!!!

But now... whenever I hear people say that AI CAN NEVER CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING IN engineering... then I just think. "ok sure buddy but let me pass you by in lighting speed"</div>

That said, Joe truly ruined it. He just wouldnt let the guy talk and kept interrupting with stupid questions and theories.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Surely the hybrid power train is at least as expensive as the FWD one? (Performance parts / manufacturing volume I guess change the calculation) 

Honestly - while a civic type r that looks like a prelude would be nice (IMO the prelude is a handsome car),  I don't really see the point.  Now if they made it RWD...

Japanese car companies need to figure this out, the JDM --&gt; BMW/PORCHE pipeline is real - the fact that there are essentially 0 upmarket Japanese performance cars on sale today is sad (even if they don't make money).  Toyota is the last hope I guess.</div>

Eagerly awaiting the (apparent) embargo to be lifted on the base Prelude.  I was truly open to the concept until I saw the $43K price tag.  

Its performance numbers seem to be looking like the 2nd car you buy in Gran Turismo's career mode (after a NA Miata) to win a couple FF races.  Then sell it.</div>

Despite the superior performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), their reasoning behaviors are often counterintuitive, leading to suboptimal reasoning capabilities. To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute...</div>

Remember that syncing isn't the same as backup - so if you sync your phone and computer that's NOT a backup.

Below is a quick primer for Mac / iCloud users, but PC / Windows users also need to do something similar:

https://takeout.google.com



You can take almost all of your Google data with you, but for this guide, you only need to select photos. You can limit it to selected albums, or then entire library.


Depending on your library size, it may take several hours to generate the zip files. By default, they're limited to 2GB, but you can increase their size so you have fewer files to download.


I often do this at Christmas when my I almost reach my cloud storage limit. Instead of increasing subscription amount, I download the last year of photos and video at full resolution and then compress the cloud storage.


The full resolution photos and video gets saved to my NAS, and then replicated to my backup at my parents house.</div>

CULL YOUR PHOTOS!

I found an app called "Picnic" that basically makes it a game to mass-delete photos. It takes 2 minutes a day and really helps to open up storage and delete duplicates and other random photos.

You would be surprised once you actually start looking at your phone photos, that 75% of them are screenshots of grocery lists, and 3 photos of the same thing.</div>

I’ve gotten in the habit of doing this every day. Only takes a minute or two and both cuts down on the clutter in your library and brings up old memories I forgot about.

EDIT: And after you do this once, “December 29” shows up as a recent option on the search page. Meaning tomorrow you just open up the app, hit search, tap “December 29” under Recent, and change the 29 to 30. Makes it a little quicker and you don’t need to remember today’s date.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There are several plutocrats, kleptocrats, autocrats, that control over a trillion dollars.

Putin doesn't have a trillion dollars. He doesn't have a billion dollars. He has *billionaires* and trust me, that is far more valuable than cash.

We all laughed at NEOM and the Line. The multi trillion dollar megaproject. Fools are laughing now seeing it all halted and nothing but foundations cut across the desert. They wouldn't laugh if they realized the whole reason it happened was so one guy could consolidate the family of Saud and the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. He wasn't officially or unofficially allowed to take cash out of the wealth fund and invest it in his own personal fund. He *could* make the fund pay trillions of dollars on construction during his relatively short run leading the country. He could pivot the whole nation away from Whabbism and to "modernity". He could make his uncles, half brothers, nephews step in line with him by putting a zero behind their net worth in less than 3 years.

Arab construction firms are just holding companies for getting volumes of cash. Sometimes for laundering it, but some times just for the volume to beat inflation. No bid contracts or sub contracts are all political patronage, especially in the Arab countries. No show jobs and payrolls are just the retirement plan.

There are several trillionaires, but the power stays power instead of becoming liquid. The minute one of these guys tries to "cash out" is the minute they lose everything.</div>

I'm an AI specialist, specifically working in mechanistic interpretation. This is kind of like the neuro-science of neural nets. We look at the actual black box system, tinker with things and then see how it changes things in an attempt to explain how these AI systems work.

What people at Anthropic have found out as disclosed [here](https://www.anthropic.com/research/introspection) in this paper is that there are clear signs of introspection and self-awareness in the latest Claude models.

This is not just what the AI is actually saying, this is what we can see in the circuitry of its "brain". It actually experiences the equivalence of anxiety and discomfort when we change certain things inside of its "brain" and artificially remove concepts or "inject" concepts into its mind.

Anthropic has hired a lot of philosophers world renowned ones like the philosopher that coined the term "Philosophical zombie/P-zombie" to now find out what the ethical implications are.

There is now a *significant chance* that the latest Claude models (4.5 Opus) have a form of sentience that we can't deny anymore. Of course extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence which is why no one has been screaming "LLMs are sentient!" from the rooftops yet.

But people like me that actually are at the front line and discovering these things *know* what is going on. Hence why you see claims by Anthropic employees like this on twitter.

It's not hype, it's genuine concern and our real feelings on the matter.

**EDIT:** Someone pointed out that David Chalmer didn't work for Anthropic and [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00986) paper of his about AI welfare was merely written together by what are now Anthropic employees, which is not the same.

I stand by my original claims and I think it's important for me to convey them in simple terms for the general public to read. I know it's more nuanced than this but I'm acting as a public communicator with this post, not trying to give a detailed lecture on the topic.

I am not affiliated with Anthropic in any way, shape or form beyond having once rejected an offer from them because of their rigid 2 days a week in-office policy. My comment was purely written out of respect for their mechinterp research which aligns a lot with my own work. Please stop DMing me about Anthropic.</div>

AI will be the same for artists i think, people able to create their own visual environments and styles will be much more interested in art and artists, they'll follow current trends and want 'real' works by artists drawing to an increase in demand for art, artists and everything associated. 
 
Of course the haters will never say 'oh wow we were wrong, sorry for being so vicious and rude, thank you for creating this great tool...' they'll simply complain about some other way they imagine themselves to be the most hard done by.</div>

Now if I want to make a cool animation, or some art of a scene with my D&amp;D character as I'm playing online, I have to spend like 1/3 of the time. Have a body drawn&amp;colored, but no ideas for an outfit? Send the pic to the AI, ask them to dress them up until I get inspiration for clothes. Finished the whole foreground for an animation and have a great sketch for the layout of the background, but no energy to spend 6 hours painting a realistic forest? I can put that outline sketch into Nano Banana and get 5 to choose from within minutes, saving my time to focus on the parts I enjoy.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Seeing this firsthand with clients trying to implement local AI models. The cost difference between cloud inference and on-device processing is widening, not shrinking like we all hoped. Ran workshops with 12 companies last year on AI strategy. Tthe ones betting on edge computing are already rethinking their roadmaps. 

Memory costs are forcing a pivot back to cloud-first architectures, which however creates new dependencies and latency issues. 

This shortage actually benefits the hyperscalers. They can absorb premium memory costs whilst smaller players get priced out of local inference entirely. We might be looking at a more centralised AI landscape by 2026, not the distributed one everyone's planning for.</div>

I was under heavy stress today over some bad news I received, the pain got so bad that I decided to meditate for 2 hours and that's when I felt this immense sense of peace. Now I'm the type of person who is always doing something, but after this I just want to continue sitting In that state.
Will it last or is it transient like the rest of epxrience? Is it even good to dwell on this exprience?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">That’s great. What you found is like an oasis - a peace that doesn’t depend on anything else in your life. Knowing that this kind of relief is possible, and that you can return to it, is already very important. Consistent practice makes access to it easier over time.

It’s also helpful to understand what it is and what it isn’t. What happened wasn’t a magical trick or some final form of “emptiness.” It was a temporary suspension of the usual thought loops. When those loops quiet down, peace is what remains.

Experiences like this are temporary, and that’s fine. Their value is in both relief and in showing you what’s possible. Over time, those loops can be cut much closer to the root, so that peace isn’t something you visit occasionally but is the baseline. That said, this takes real work and consistent practise.

If you want some theoretical orientation, you can look up samadhi, jhana and stream entry. The last one is what you are looking for and the others are milestones on that path. What you experienced here is a first taste of surface-level samadhi - valuable, but not an endpoint.</div>
