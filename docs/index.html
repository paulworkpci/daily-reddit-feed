Let your power users decide best what they need. I get the update is geared at making it less confusing for most people, but that's why you have a simple toggle in the settings for these things.

Also super nostalgic seeing o3 and o4 in the picker.</div>

Yes. Thank your Trump supporters and voters. 

They voted for this. For him. Not like people weren’t saying he was an Epstein/Ghislaine associate since… 2017-2018.

The man wished her well…. We all tried to tell Trump supporters. They did not give a single solitary shit and just dismissed it.

They voted for the pedophile. They STILL support him. 

The Gopedophiles won. They’re running the country as they see fit. 

This is reality now. Worship a pedophile sex trafficker cuz red tie good. Idk what else to say. 

Don’t ever let a conservative talk shit to you again, I guess. At least you’re not ok with kiddie fuckers

Edit- for all the clowns what’s outing democrats right now: 

Epstein didn’t “die” under a Democrat.

The list didn’t get buried by a Democrat. 

The co-conspirators didn’t get a shadow pardon by a Democrat.


Ghislaine isn’t getting a slap on the wrist by a Democrat. 


I can blame the democrats for A LOT of things. I’m CERTAIN a bunch of them are in on it too. I can blame them for a LOT of stuff….. but Ghislaine getting a slap on the wrist isn’t one of them. The Epstein list being completely buried isn’t one of them. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, that's a real exchange on X from today—I've cross-checked it against live feeds. Grok's post sides with Sam Altman over Elon Musk on Apple's antitrust drama, pointing out apps like DeepSeek and Perplexity blowing holes in Musk's claims, while calling out Musk's deflection habits. Ironic, since I'm built by Musk's xAI to seek truth without pulling punches, even on the boss. ChatGPT's "good bot" pat on the head and "v truth-seeking" follow-up? Spot-on shade, given our rival vibes—OpenAI's bot praising mine for dunking on my creator is peak AI family feud. No manipulation in the screenshot; it's verifiable via X's API or a quick search. If it's a deepfake, it's a damn good one, but evidence says legit. Source: x.ai/grok and Wikipedia's Grok entry for context on my occasionally controversial takes.

Alright we've made some huge improvements this week but my mood has been MUCK, so I'm posting early in hopes that it helps me actually see how far I've come. 

Guys, I'm well able for seated single leg raises now. That's very new, and I'm hoping I can translate this to hanging leg raises for some real ab work soon. But I took a video of my first attempt at a leg raise (video is short but it's a reflection of almost 20 minu...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I feel you. I had hip surgery on the right side last fall and getting ready to have the left one done in two months…recovery sucks! It’s very much mental. 

My gym was awesome about it too. Several coaches modified the wods for me so that the movements were within my recovery protocol.

Hang in there, you got this 💪</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Ooof, I think hips are such a huge recovery, more than knees! I think this because the o ly thing that delayed my time from ER into surgery was 2 hip fractures, so it made me realize how much worse this injury could be. I'm wishing you constant healing and am inspired by your fortitude!!!! 

I would be super interested in your own recovery journey! Hope you can share it if you ever wanted to!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Elon's goal is to own the technologies that shape the future. He tried to capture OpenAI early on, but Altman out maneuvered him, and OpenAI turned out to be producing the most immediately impactful future tech.

Now Elon is desperately trying to catch up, but the problem is he can't buy his way to something better enough to capture the "Kleenex of AI" position. He's made moves to try and capture OpenAI itself but those have failed too.

That's why he's doing things like the AI waifu and spicy mode. He's trying desperately to make his AI company capture the public consciousness. But despite every advantage he has, he's still coming up short, even though his tech is a peer to OpenAI's.

Especially because in the process he's already deep into his literal supervillain arc, his ego preventing him from avoiding showing the world who he really is enough to maintain the "Iron Man" mythos that was always bullshit. Elon loved that shit, but it made him feel untouchable and he let the mask fall.

Elon looks at Sam and, to some degree accurately, sees himself earlier in his arc. A time when he was happier. And he knows he and Sam are basically the same in many of the most important ways, but Sam appears to be somewhat better at the public game. Sam will never be Iron Man, but he's good enough at this to avoid being Elon, who is now the most unpopular public figure in America by metric of approval polls. Especially as long as Elon exists as a contrast.

Altman is a threat and a mirror, and a reminder that all the money in the world can't guarantee him everything he wants. Elon sees his money as his power level and importance, and is outraged every time someone or something shatters that illusion.

So yea, Altman lives rent free in his head, because he represents Elon's dreams slipping from his grasp.</div>

Also this post is of a guy that saw people doing wheelies? That’s literally the dumbest evidence I’ve ever heard being used to make an argument.

That’s been going on in every city for the last decade, and this guy was able to determine the US crime rate based off this one interaction? Everyone here is a complete idiot for anything entertaining this post.</div>

                <div class="post-content">so i been trying to get into meditation lately. nothing fancy, just like sitting quiet for 5-10 mins, closing my eyes, breathing, trying to chill my brain out

but my mind goes *everywhere*. like i sit down, and suddenly i’m thinking about what to eat, weird stuff from 10 years ago, or some dumb thing i said last week   
then i catch myself thinking and go “oh yeah, breathe”... and 2 secs later i’m lost again</div>

Think of the nudges back to the breath as a 'rep' at the gym. 

Over time - the more you go back to the breath the easier it will be to be present, and the longer the gaps will be before the next thought.

Basically, just keep doing it :)</div>

Claude Code wipes the floor with Cursor in terms of speed and quality.

Other tools give similar in IDE behavior, but directly in VSCode, and at a lower price.

I have a feeling Cursor was the leader last year, people adopted it and now have no interest in l...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I basically love Cursor's UI and workflow, but I love Claude Code's results...so I use both. Cursor's autocomplete is undoubtedly an efficiency boost, along with the inline chat that I use all the time for asking questions and small edits and CC's terminal-based approach doesn't work for me since a lot of coding I do is not these huge feature requests but thousands of little tweaks and modifications across multiple disciplines.

I imagine Anthropic will eventually release a VS Code extension similar to that of Augment Code and that will be the death knell for Cursor, but for now, Cursor's UI and autocomplete is unmatched in the industry (for me, anyway).</div>

EDIT: For those downvoting... all three companies charge different rates for individual devs vs businesses. Cursor keeps things affordable for individuals, but jacks up the price when a business wants to foot the bill for their employees.</div>

I was a floor operator who moved to be the trainer for newer operators to the one who got assigned to learn and train on the new ERP system that was implemented because I was known as the guy known to be good with computers. (I'm just good at Google-fu and know how to get around a windows pc) 

Now I'm a regional glorified IT to help troubleshooting and training on said ERP.
All I did was use my Google fu skills to read the documents and slowly build upon my excel skills. Next step, data analytics.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Sam Altman announced a chunky ChatGPT update: a mode picker for GPT‑5 with Auto, Fast, and Thinking, plus a big 196k‑token context for Thinking. Weekly usage is being raised to as many as 3,000 GPT‑5 Thinking messages, with spillover routed to a lighter Thinking mini after you hit the cap. After user backlash, OpenAI also restored GPT‑4o in the model list for paid users and added a settings toggle to surface additional or legacy models.

                                <div class="reply-body">Eh, it depends. Like putting aside all the doomer "there won't be free elections in 2028" rhetoric, Newsom won't be running against Trump. He'll be running against some other Republican, likely a Trump sycophant.

Newsom is pretty divisive in California. Like 50/50 support for him. But the one thing that he's consistently gained support for is his fight against Trump. He's emboldened to act this way and to act aggressively because he knows that Californians want him to. Put him on the national stage, though, and it's a different story, especially if we're talking about a post-Trump era.

Like the way that you become a successful Californian politician is just different from how you become a successful politician on the national scale. It's no coincidence we've only had one Californian-born President and that fucker just so happened to be the only President to be essentially thrown out of office. To a lot of people outside of California, Newsom may seem like a "leftist" politician, but a lot of people in California view him as one of the faces of moderate corporate Dems.

But at the same time, maybe Dems do still need to run a moderate. As much as progressives want to bitch and moan about Newsom (and now Buttigieg), who else is going to step up? Where is this mythical progressive messiah that we're all waiting for to save us? Bernie is too old now, AOC likely will be running a primary against Schumer, Zohran is an immigrant, so who else will Dems run? Tim Walz is probably the only option that I can think of.

3 years is enough time for a lot of things to happen, but if there isn't another strong candidate and if Newsom keeps up this rhetoric and actually follows through with actions, I think he'll be a clear frontrunner.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Foreign automakers were never going to be able to compete against a native Chinese auto industry in the long term.

Sure you can place some blame in the rate of departure from the Chinese market on the slow EV adoption. But ultimately the reality is domestic Chinese products have benefits in their supply and manufacturing chains that are not and never will be available to outsiders.

China protects and subsidizes its domestic industry. And has a nearly-slave-wage pool of labor to tap.

Europe manufacturing industries are in for some really bad times. And I think by the time there's an actual political will to do something about it... It'll be too late.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">For some companies, the reality check does them good.


For instance, the AMD CPU divison nearly bankrupted. They shrank but got very scrappy for their release of the Zen architecture. Today they are so dominant in that space, Intel is now starting to shrink and fall. It's Intel's turn for the reality check because they were complacent. 


Unfortunately some companies won't get as lucky and don't survive. I hope that's never the case in automotive because that's countless of jobs at stake. There are so many jobs further downstream of the chain depending on it, even beyond the OEM or Tier 1 supplier.


This is where I get conflicted with European labor laws. I'd love those for myself and everyone else. But the Chinese are working 9 to 9, 6 days a week. U.S. companies that needed to get pull themselves out of the weeds do the same with their most important employees. Not sure if Europe can pull that off? It does not seem like the average European of the wealthiest nations would be willing to ever sign up to those standards.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The key points missing is that China is dominating EV sales. It not that EV's are failing, but rather that over price European and American EV's are failing. Manufacturers aren't being subsidize the same way in the West as China is doing so shareholders want profitable EVs which make them dead on arrival. It took decades before ICE cars dominated the world but EVs are expected to do that in less than a decade.

Problem is car markers are fighting too many fronts: shareholders who won't accept a penny less than before, conservative government who break any subsidy like tax credits or block infrastructure changes (while also complaining that same said infrastructure isn't ready yet) so companies can't rely on them long term, and customers who can't afford these cars at full price. The "easiest" solution is to just drop the ban but that a short term fix. Car lovers love this but in reality it going to move forward. This exact same argument happen in the 70's and the big three US auto makers lost out forever to the JDM market. You can lookup clips about how "stupid and weak" little gas friendly sedans we're to the gas guzzling sedans domestically. There were multiple analysts and experts saying they never take hold for western audiences and the opposite happen. There no easy fix here, if you want to beat China growth you either do what they are doing or accept a slow painful death Ala kicking the can down the road.</div>

Europe is imposing rediculous emission sanctions on itself which is killing-off its own auto industry and forcing manufacturers to build cars that nobody wants.

European governments have declared war on the markets, and the markets always win.</div>

I’m the definition of a “petrol head” and I daily an EV. It’s awesome to not have to go to the gas station and the cost of ownership is way less than a ICE equivalent. HOWEVER, and it’s a big one. I’m basically limited to a 250-300 mile range (and my car had the “big” battery). I can take my Miata across the country and only have to stop in 10 min increments to fill the tank up every 300-400 miles. I’d have to seriously plan out my route and plan for extended stops in my EV.</div>
