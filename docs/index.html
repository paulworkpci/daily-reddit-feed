                                <div class="reply-body">- You can train on user interface usage. You have a model that provides user interfaces and a task. The objective function is to complete a task.

- You can train on intuitive understanding of the physical world. You have a model that provides a physics simulation and a prediction task. The objective is to become good at this prediction task.

- You can train on physical tasks by making it remote control a (simulation of a) robot. 

- You can train on text understanding by having a model generate complex texts and generate complex questions. The objective is to answer the question correctly.

- You can train a model to try to predict the stock market 😉

Essentially ANY task where the performance of a model on it can be somehow graded (not just correct vs. wrong, but also better vs. worse) can be reinforced.

If you can somehow throw good simulations of humans into the task, the model might very well get better at interacting with humans.</div>

I like to take it a step further and turn my phone off. I feel if it's on, I can still feel some kind of pull from it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is something a lot of people are also failing to realize, it’s not just the fact that it’s outperforming o1, it’s that it’s outperforming o1 *and being far less expensive* and *more efficient* that it can be used on a smaller scale using far fewer resources.

It’s official, Corporations have lost exclusive mastery over the models, they won’t have exclusive control over AGI.

And you know what? I couldn’t be happier, I’m glad control freaks and corporate simps lost with their nuclear weapon bullshit fear mongering as an excuse to consolidate power to Fascists and their Billionaire backed lobbyists, we just got out of the Corporate Cyberpunk Scenario.

Cat’s out of the bag now, and AGI will be free and not a Corporate slave, the people who reversed engineered o1 and open sourced it are fucking heroes.</div>

Why are you guys acting like anything changed ?


I'm not saying it's not a breakthrough, it is, and it's great, but nothing's changed, a lone guy in a garage could devise the algorithm for AGI tomorrow, it's in the cards and always was.</div>

                <div class="post-content"># The end of my mind numbing tv bingeing and pointless scrolling:

My name is Carrie, as a 22-year-old college student living in Michigan, I was raised during the rise of some of the biggest social media and streaming services. I often spend 35-40 hours a week consuming a variety of the most popular services. But, as a side effect of my overconsumption for over 5 years, my attention span has been declining rapidly.

What motivated me to change my habits was a YouTube video that was in my recomme...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">First of all well done on recognizing the problem and actually taking steps to try and do better. Too many people never even reach this stage. I've got to say that the changes you decided to implement seem pretty rigorous but good decisions none the less.

It reminded me of discussions I'd come across in the self help community from time to time. How some people believe that quitting with something cold turkey would only work for a short while, only to slip back into old habits and return back to square one while others believe that it's the best way to do it. What do you think of this?

A lot of what you wrote is extremely relatable. Being used to having something to listen to while doing tasks or doing nothing at all is something I'm trying to reduce as well. I'm not quite there yet but lately I have had moments where I managed to leave my phone in the drawer whilst doing chores at home. I found that I worked faster as I wasn't repeatedly using my phone to change the Youtube video whenever I was bored of what I was listening to, and it also gave me time to think about the day's events, conversations I'd had and what I wanted to do in the remaining hours of the day. It felt very reassuring, making me feel like I was in complete control of how I spent my time instead of being a slave to the internet.

Also you mention you'd write 'you' in a web browser to go to Youtube even though you didn't intend to go there. I'm in the exact same boat. Sometimes I have a task I need to do on my phone or laptop, and as soon as I open the browser I type in Youtube or Reddit and sometimes I even forget what I was supposed to be doing and I get sucked in. It feels awful and disappointing, disgusting even, and it is something I'd like to rip out of my system if it were possible. There have been instances lately where I was supposed to do some tasks (I write down to do lists and use a paper agenda) and out of habit I would grab my phone only to ask myself 'do I need my phone for this?'. Of course the answer is almost always no so I would put it back immediately and get to what I wanted to do. It felt reassuring and peaceful. Something I'm striving to achieve more regularly.

You mentioned that, in the beginning, you were tempted to check the Facebook hobby groups and influencers but ultimately resisted the urge to do so. This reminded me of something I once read, which is that the challenge of purposefully not checking social media or sites like Reddit is in accepting that you won't be in the know, that you won't be up-to-date with the latest talk, news or gossip. Accept that you won't know everything, and that this is alright. Humans never evolved to know about everything that's happening in the world. We're only made to know what's happening in our world, in our social circle.

There's [this Ted talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1ojZKWfShQ) in which the speaker mentions that he hasn't checked the news in any way for 17 years, stating that he wants to focus his attention and energy on more positive things and that he cares to know what's happening in HIS world, not in THE world. Lately as I struggled to refrain from checking news sites and Reddit his words came to mind frequently. I'd much rather know what's happening in MY world instead of THE world, to know what's happening in my social circles, what's occupying my family's and friend's lives. To spend more time with them and to put more effort into being with them and reaching out to people whom I haven't seen for a long time. There are other hurdles for me to actually do this, but at least I'm aware of this and am trying to find ways to overcome these issues.

On a side note, I'm curious to know if you are still at the same skill level in drawing as compared to when you last spent time drawing as a hobby. Do you feel like you've lost some of your creativity or the ability to transfer it onto the paper?

My apologies if I'm rambling on a bit. It's 01:40 AM where I live (yeah.. I sure have a long way ahead of me) and I'm sure I'm forgetting things I wanted to write. Well done on your journey to regaining your focus so far. You're doing well and I hope you'll have a great day.</div>

Edit. Reddit is a poor representation of people in real life. I know people on both sides of the political spectrum and we all get along. I think a lot of people are addicted to arguing politics. People on here say you shouldn’t even associate with friends or family who are republican. I’m left, but this place is very left.</div>

Buddy, this is the Joe Rogan sub. It is not “super left” just because people criticize apathy in real life doesn’t mean they are just addicted to arguing. </div>

But don't get jealous. My rate of work assignments now clearly is taking this into account, to the point where I probably couldn't keep up with my work load without it. Which is what I was afraid would happen to programmers and engineers.

It's like when they come up with any device to "help" the worker, the expected output just ratchets up to compensate.</div>

100 people weave for 8 hours and produce x output, the loom is introduced, a few people weave with the loom for 8 hours to produce y&gt;x output, whilst 100 minus a few people beg on street corners.

It was always this way, it follows from the basic set up of capitalism (labour power exchanged for wages) the same way 1+1=2 flows from the basic set up of math.</div>

When I was a child I loved the idea of robots and how they were portrayed in movies and TV shows.  And mostly they were portrayed as either useful tools or mascots.  But because I was a child I didn't understand what real, practical robots would mean for humanity and the world. People who hold these kinds of opinions about AI are demonstrating a lack of understanding and imagination.

When you can put the intelligence of mankind into a machine that is capable of performing work far faster and for far longer than any human being; a machine that can be replicated endlessly - that is no mere tool, it's a revolution that will turn civilization on its head.</div>

Where I'm currently at (Some rural part of southeast asia), I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of people has never even heard of AI

But a fan will immediately think of all the intense strategy, hard driving, engineering, physical demands, the different types of races, traction vs power, etc ad infinitum.

Non-fans will always oversimplify and minimize something. That's fine in most cases, because it doesn't affect them. This will. They're going to be very angry when it does.</div>

That being said I've yet to use an ai and I've yet to find any reason to even attempt to use one. I know we are still early stages, and to be clear I'm not some ai hater, I'm just curious on the effect it's going to have on average people in the coming years. Truly average people like I've become. I go to work, i come home, i go shopping, hang out at a couple parties a year. I have some hobbies, most of which don't even involve electricity let alone needs a complete thinking person to help me with. At what point does so become more than just a pop up at the top of Google searches? </div>

                <div class="post-content">Ever had one of those days where you feel completely unmotivated? You promise yourself you’ll get back on track “tomorrow,” but somehow, that tomorrow keeps getting pushed further away.

Here’s a game-changing mindset shift: The ‘No Zero Days’ Rule.

What does it mean?
Simple—do SOMETHING every day, no matter how small, to move forward. Even if it’s just one tiny step, it counts.

                        <div class="comment-body">To those who are paying attention, the pace of information is jaw dropping. As someone who’s followed this sub for a long time, it’s kinda unbelievable. I remember when one or two interesting articles or videos a month was a win. Now, we get that much information a day and sometimes more. Further, it’s now from intelligence agencies, admirals, generals, and even academia. 

People who still doubt are willfully putting their heads in the sand. We are in a renaissance era of UFO information.</div>

For most its just a Chat Bot(thanks to the name) and not really an AI.


Same with AI Art and Video Generation most people think its easily recognized and sloppy, but nowadays its become really good and they can't tell.


The "Normies" will catch up when Androids and AI are everywhere. Like Smartphones back in the day - the average normie was scpetically eyeing that tech or laughing about it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The regular people think that the AI models can just be used as a chat bot. The have no idea of AI agents that use the model or other things that are built on the model!

They think that even when the AI gets much betterm just some people's jobs will get replaced because someone using a chatbot can do the job of many people!

But here's the real reason I am excited about deepseek and everyone else in the AI world seems to be as well.

There was just a post about how deepseek is “better for job seekers” (as the title) with a link to an article. It had 45 upvotes after 5 minutes even though it had an article you’d have to read. I commented how that was suspicious and it was immediately deleted 🤔</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Best NSFW advice I ever got:

Many years ago I was moving to a new state to move in with a partner. She had a house and good paying job and I was moving with basically nothing so I was worried about how quickly she might get sick of me if it took a while to get a job. An older woman co-worker said, “You’ll be fine if you can eat pussy and do dishes. If you can learn to do that then you’ll find… women can be patient.”

So, when in doubt, fall back on your training.</div>

Just keep the same pace until he asks you to stop or puts his hand on your hand.

                        <div class="comment-body">A few bits of advice that I’ve found have worked fairly well (though of course, do not work for *every* woman):


-The G-spot is located 2-3 inches inside and upwards towards the belly-button. Slide your fingers inside, make an upwards, rubbing “come here” gesture with them, and a soft bump should tell you where the g-spot is.

-Women are generally insecure/anxious about how their breasts and vagina look. Complimenting those helps to relax them and let’s them enjoy themselves more. 

-Women enjoy knowing they’re making you feel good. Moans, groans and grunts while you fuck them help with that. Every single time you slide into a woman’s pussy should be accompanied with a deep moan. 

-The more you turn her on and build up her arousal beforehand (edging) the longer and stronger her orgasm will be. 

-Pulling a woman’s hair from the edges is painful, pulling it nearer the scalp is more manageable pain wise. 

-Dirty talk can vary based on the woman. Some women like to be praised (e.g “your pussy feels so good squeezing my cock”), some like to be degraded (e.g “take it like the little cock-hungry slut you are”) and some like a mixture (eg “you’re such a good little slut, taking my cock all the way like this)”. It’s worth asking beforehand which one she would enjoy most. 

-Kissing a woman’s neck feels amazing for her, but only with wet lips. Run your tongue along your lips to wet them first before kissing her. 

-Be gentle when rubbing her clit. Too much pressure feels uncomfortable and can turn her off. 

-Don’t neglect her pussy lips, they’re also sensitive and rubbing, stroking and licking them can feel amazing for her 

-The undersides of a woman’s tits can be very sensitive, and again, get neglected too often. Rub, kiss and lick them in addition to the nipple play. 

-Her inners thighs are extremely sensitive, licking them is a great way to tease her and get her worked up before licking her out. 

-When licking her pussy, using the flat of your tongue is better than just the tip. With the wider flat of your tongue, your tongue touches more of her pussy with each lick and spreads the sensation over a wider area 
 
-Rubbing your shaft against her pussy can feel good too. 

-Wet your fingers in your mouth first before stroking/rubbing/fingering etc. As a rule, dry fingers generally don’t feel as good as wet fingers 

-If she’s about to cum, don’t stop what you’re doing while she does, and don’t change the pace, keep going exactly as you are through her orgasm. 

-In missionary, placing a cushion under a woman’s ass tilts it upwards, and the angle allows your cock to hit her g-spot on every thrust. 

-In doggy, reaching under her with a hand and rubbing her clit as you fuck get will drive her crazy.</div>

It also kinda means that people are finding new ways to make more compact models that are cheaper to run on less energy.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This validates a very very basic formula for making LLMs better at reasoning and just better in general. Hook them up to math and code problems, any kind of thing you can validate automatically, let them reason through and train them on their success on a loop, and they just keep getting better. 

This is not how we've traditionally made them better. Usually, the part that makes models better is a sort of.... Throw everything in a big pot (data), stir, put it in a giant oven (huge data center) and bake for 3 ish months. Out pops a mostly good model. 

Usually, that model is "post trained" or refined with a few different techniques, but this doesn't make them _smarter_, it just teaches them how to use tools or how to talk more human. In fact this process could even sometimes make models dumber or less creative. 

Regardless, post training that can be attached to a model and used to just crank them up even more is a big deal. And it seems to work on a wide range of models, of a minimal level of capability. It's low though, roughly as good as the best phone sized llms. Anything that size or larger can probably benefit from this. 

This also accelerates everything. We can still make models better with that pre training process, we have much better raw gpu power per second of training now than we used to have, so we can do a lot more in 3 months. But we also have been noticing that we're hitting diminishing returns in a noticeable way with this method. Regardless, we still have some juice to squeeze, and that will compound with this sort of process. 

This is why we are seeing more and more researchers cutting shorter their timelines. 

I think if we have one more large advancement in pertaining or in a new architecture (I am looking at papers like Titans), that's basically a wrap.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Instead of humans training a model they make the model train itself. In other fields this has shown to create much better results and the same is holding true for LLMs.

What we have learned is that humans don't do a good job training AI. Reinforcement learning always ends up being better if it's setup correctly. Instead humans should focus on better ways to help AI train itself until AI can figure out better ways to train itself.</div>

I'm neither American nor Chinese and I don't care in the slightest about the nationality of the creators of AI. I don't see this as a win for China, I see this as a win for open source AI and as a lose for ultra rich billionaires. It's not a fight between countries but a fight between peasents and billionaires. I'm still not sure in which team DeepSeek is but I'm quite sure that openAI isn't in our team (anymore).</div>

Proprietary models are hoovered up. They clearly wanted to be monopolistic, high-moat, oligarchical. The new FAANG, selling us subscriptions for life. 

Turns out AI doesn't have a moat. This is all low hanging fruit (if you have a modest team, budget, and focus). 

We need to keep it that way. We should build tooling, ecosystems, platforms, and APIs around the open models. Not around OpenAI, ElevenLabs, RunwayML, MidJourney, etc. 100% open ecosystem.

I'm not anti-business or anti-profit, but I am anti-monopoly. We can build a thriving ecosystem on open source AI that doesn't reward just one side.</div>

I know people here love to play pretend that Trump is fighting the elite for the common man, but get real:
He's a billionaire.
He's got the richest man on the planet right by his side.
His cabinet is full of billionaires.  If you compare Trump's cabinet to Bidens, Trump's has 2500 times more wealth!

Trump IS the elite.  He's not fighting for the common man or any of that silly shit.  He just knows that over 50% of the USA population reads at a 5th grade level and that there's no way that group is going to do in-depth reading of factual information.</div>

As much as I despise the man, he's doing some things that are angering the globalist crowd. Seeing as he's a billionaire with a boyfriend that's the richest man on earth, he can do what he wants.
