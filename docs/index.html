Unfortunately that’s an ability we are losing as a nation. For every Jim Farley, there are a thousand more who dismisses anything Chinese as “propaganda” (just look at this morning’s Xiaomi thread, absolutely embarrassing).

Hell, those people are here in this thread, calling everyone shills because they are suffering through a cognitive dissonance due to their confirmation bias being attacked.

That’s not mentioning the entire EV thing is now a hot political issue here, with the people fighting against EVs being the same people who get all upset at China’s EV progress.

Apparently other countries are not even allowed to beat us in a competition that we decided to not participate in.</div>

If I have a kid who doesn't get good grades, and I say that there are other kids who get better grades, that doesn't mean I'm saying I dislike my own kid.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think being honest and acknowledge your weakness and competitors’ strength is just a healthy attitude to have as a leader.

Like I grew up with Asian parents. My parents constantly told me how overachieving all the other kids are, not to “glaze” them, but to motivate *me*.

It doesn’t mean my parents wanted to disown me and adopt other kids.

Maybe the American attitude is to always praise your own and dismiss others’ achievements just to feel better.

IMO, that is not a good attitude for success.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I no longer “meditate” in the traditional sense.

There’s no timer. No technique. No posture. No breath-counting.
Just… being.

It began with deep practice. Silence. Fasting. Vows. Radical detachment. But now, even when I walk, read, eat, or sit, I feel as though I’m meditating. Not because I’m “trying” to, but because I’m no longer pulled by thoughts, pleasures, or identity.

I’ve lost interest in desire, stimulation, performance, even self-concept.
There’s a steady background awareness, clean,...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">That's the point of meditation, in my opinion! Buddha talked about four meditation "postures" of lying down, sitting, standing, and walking. I don't think that was intended to mean there are four ways to practice formally, but that the intention was to practice being present no matter what posture your body was in, throughout all of the day's activities.

It's also why in Zen there is an emphasis on not doing anything at all, "just sitting" (shikantaza), or just being. The point of meditation isn't to get anywhere, but to practice being here and now.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If you want to get people like Joe Rogan to accept global warming is happening, is human caused and is bad, you have to actually engage with his points intelligently. Yes, on 10000+ year time scales, we are in a cooling period. But on a 200 year time span, we are warming at an unprecedented rate. Yes the earth has been warmer in the past but it's never warmed this fast. It's warming far faster than species can adapt. Deaths of important plant/animal species, rising sea levels, increased severe storms and increased areas of inhospitable land are all reasons this warming is bad.

EDIT: One thing I forgot to address is Joe's skepticism is heavily effected by the authoritarian measures sometimes being proposed to address climate change. Stuff like requiring people to change their standards of living and/or pay higher prices for energy. Making people eat less meat, drive less, fly less etc is a sure fire way to harden their position against climate change.</div>

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=focaMjQbmkI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=focaMjQbmkI)

He argues that either the AI's growth is physical, consuming the planet for resources in an "Outward Explosion" where we wouldn't be observers but dead weight. Or, its growth is internal, where its thoughts become so hyper-compressed and efficient that its output would look like pure random noise ...</div>

this large language model infact is a Pandora box for human, there are lots of combination of words human haven't found or token care of.

AI extends the cognition of people by extend language combinations. - people might find some disruptive things via this.

the other way, AI consumes a lot electricity. as quite a few leaders like Jensen Huang and Andrej Kapathy mentioned AI is the new electricity. imagine how is the grid look like 10 years later?</div>

Right now there are 4 hooks: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Notification`, and `Stop`.

I tried wiring up the last two to a custom notification script that pushes alerts to my phone, so I can be notified immediately when the agent finishes its job.

There are probably other fun ways to use these I think. Might be good for automatically running l...</div>

The private one is an LSP hook which supports PHP, C#.NET, Java, Python and TypeScript at the moment. It reports back to Claude whenever it edits or writes to a supported code file if there are any warnings or errors.

The other one that has had limited testing is a Git checkpointing system, a feature I miss in Claude Code. This repo is public on GitHub.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Zuckerberg lacks vision; his every move is an ill-conceived overreaction to some external trend.

Struggling in the mobile market? Better buy WhatsApp and Instagram. Virtual reality looks like the next big thing? I’ll buy Oculus. Oh now the Metaverse is gaining hype? Well my whole company is called ‘Meta’ now.

Suddenly it’s six weeks later and everyone has forgotten all about the Metaverse, but that’s OK because actually Meta is also an AI company… except they aren’t very good at it, so they’re hoping to simply throw money at the problem and brute force innovation.

The problem is ASI may not be an easy 12-24 month sprint. For all we know, it could take the better part of a decade. That requires sustained vision and commitment, which is hard to imagine from a CEO who aimlessly drifts from one trend to the next. Eventually Meta will suffer a bad quarter or three, find themselves no closer to ASI, and have to contend with investors grumbling about R&amp;D capex and no clear path to an ROI. That’s when Zuckerberg will flail about for the next hot tech trend and pivot in a wildly different direction, leaving AI research to the few companies genuinely committed to long-term research advancement. 

I predict five years from now these engineers will have profited more from these outlandish paychecks than Meta will have profited from the ASI they’re supposedly making.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I hate Zuckerberg with a passion, but you're misrepresenting almost all of the details. 

Instagram was bought by Facebook in 2012 for 1 billion, that was before almost anyone knew of it. It then went on to become, well everyone knows...

Whatsapp was bought in 2014, and is orders of magnitude the size and popularity that it was at the time of acquisition.

Oculus was bought in 2014 when the only product launched at the time was the prototype DK1, and Facebook/Meta was the only major company working on VR at the time. Ask anyone knowledgeable about VR/AR, it's undeniable that Meta advanced the field by about a decade in a matter of years, just by pouring billions into R&amp;D and creating the ecosystem, when no other major company was willing to pour the resources into growing it.

The Metaverse was initially announced as a project that would take 10-15 years; Zuckerberg was criticized for pouring billions into a project that may never see a profit, and if it does, will only come to fruition in a decade or more, when the AR technology has advanced to the point where it can be fit into slim glasses. 

The Metaverse is exactly the kind of sustained vision that you criticized him for not having.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Let’s play the devil’s advocate.

You say Zuckerberg lacks vision. Maybe. But you can’t say he lacks execution.

Instagram was a defensive play against Twitter and Snapchat. Everyone laughed at the price. Now it’s printing money. WhatsApp looked absurd at $19 billion, but it gave Meta dominance in global messaging. Oculus was early, sure, but Meta now leads in consumer VR hardware. It’s not flashy, but it’s functional. And they’ve shipped millions of units while others are still figuring out their strategy. (See Apple Vision Pro)

The Metaverse pivot looked ridiculous, but that’s because people misunderstood it. Zuckerberg wasn’t trying to chase a short-term trend. He saw what comes after mobile. It flopped with the public, but the infrastructure like VR, AR, spatial computing is still in motion. You don’t need mass adoption today. You just need to be in position when the curve turns.

Now with AI, you’re seeing the same pattern. Meta is behind on LLMs, sure. But Llama 3 is catching up. They’re open-sourcing for strategic reasons just like DeepSeek: to undermine the moat of OpenAI and Google. Let the world build on your model. Gain mindshare and talent. And unlike OpenAI, Meta can absorb the cost.

The idea that they’ll run out of patience in a few bad quarters ignores their history.

Zuckerberg might not have a Jobs like vision. But he’s a cold, efficient operator. He doesn’t need to invent the next thing. He just needs to be early enough, with deep pockets and the will to ride it out. Five years from now, it’s not unlikely Meta will still be one of the top three players in AI and with a business model to monetize it faster than the idealists.

Meta operates as an aggressive second mover. They don’t wait and watch, they enter early enough to matter, let others define the initial shape of a trend, then scale it faster, cheaper, and more globally. It’s imitation as a weapon, backed by infrastructure and war chest.

Instagram? Bought and scaled.

Stories? Copied from Snapchat, then surpassed.

TikTok’s short-form format? Cloned into Reels, now massively monetized through Meta’s existing ad engine.

LLMs? OpenAI defined the moment, but Meta released competitive open models with Llama. Not leading, but not trailing far either, and unlike OpenAI, Meta can integrate AI into billions of users’ feeds, chats, and commerce flows almost instantly.

They basically mastered the second mover advantage. One that moves hard, fast, and with overwhelming force. Think Microsoft in the ‘90s copy the idea, dominate the distribution.</div>

I wouldn't call it "deterministic output" because that's not really what LLMs do, but there are definitely use cases where you need a certain level of consistency and predictability, you know?

I don't know if you've taken a look around but the bible thumpers ain't running the show here, it's the billionaires.  AI regulation will go nowhere so long as the promise of never having to pay labor again seems possible for the billionaires building AI.</div>

And it was Republican senators who were ultimately responsible for shooting down the provision, including people like Majorie Taylor Greene (?!?), who refused to vote for the bill unless it was taken out.  Tech has an outsized influence in politics, sure, but they’re not unstoppable.</div>

We never let her off leash, even at the dog park. 

I try to give other dogs a wide berth and keep myself between her and them. 

And our city has a leash ordinance. But some people think it doesn't apply to them, so occasionally we'll meet people who are walking their dog off leash. They'll see us and say "oh don't worry, he's friendly". 

Yeah ok mate, but my dog isn't. 

I wish she weren't like this. I also wish she wasn't abandoned on the street as a puppy and taken through 3 foster homes before she came to us, but here we are.</div>

We literally bread this into them over generations.  Like Australian Cattle dogs for example we selectively bred to enjoy fucking up dingos who got too close to the cattle.  Most people only think of them as this fun energetic breed, which they are, but are dumbfounded when they act like what they are: a dog bred for herding and defending cattle in a harsh environment.

Out in their natural environment, a strange dog running up to you means it’s time to fucking throw down, not time to play.</div>

Nah.

It's been a huge thing in sci books for decades. In fact a lot of the more serious / hard sci fi books take realistic approach that humans never pilot spacecraft.</div>

Then, they passed it to the LLM and asked it for recommendations of how to orient and maneuver the spacecraft.

This sounds like the most inefficient possible way to run an autopilot system. Haha</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This kind of thing is why it’s actually quite believable when Dario and Demis say most diseases could be cured within the next decade. It’s hard to grasp if you don’t understand the implications of being able to create a custom peptide for any biological target on demand. Traditional drug discovery relied on screening huge libraries and hoping something sticks, so right now it takes years just to identify a viable candidate, let alone optimize and test it.

Now imagine skipping the trial-and-error and directly designing molecules that just work. We will literally see years of research compressed into months or even weeks. Drug development might be one of the first fields where we actually “feel” the singularity as new treatments are belted out faster than we can keep up with. (Note that clinical trials will eventually be done entirely in simulation, thus vastly accelerating the time from testing to market availability)

I should also mention that this tech would enable medications with drastically fewer side effects, since they can be designed to bind only the intended receptor with minimal interaction elsewhere in the body.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’m very bullish on AI in general, but I think this kind of misses the mark. 

Right now, we can’t design novel binders, but soon we will be able to. What is less clear is what that gets us. Usually, drugs don’t fail because they don’t bind the target, and usually we’re able to find binders to a given target even without solving protein-protein docking. What more often causes failure are off target effects, idiosyncratic immune reactions, and failure to identify the correct target. 

You just have to look at a random collection of conditions to tell that even designing good binders with no off-target effects, immunogenicity, etc. wouldn’t cure many conditions. How does designing good peptide binders let us cure type 2 diabetes? What about atrial fibrillation? Rheumatoid arthritis? Schizophrenia? Chronic kidney disease? NAFLD? Multiple sclerosis? Depression? These aren’t cases where we have a target that cures the disease and just can’t find a binder, they’re diseases caused by complex multi-factorial cascades (probably idiosyncratic to each patient). Even for something “simple” like GERD, I can’t imagine good protein models being able to do any better than your run of the mill PPI. 

Don’t get me wrong, protein-protein interaction prediction models will cure some conditions, but we will need some other transformative technology to cure most/all. This transformative technology will not be at the level of proteins, it will be at the level of cells/organs/organ systems/entire organisms. I think it’s more likely that AI designs this system than that humans do, given the complexity needed.</div>
