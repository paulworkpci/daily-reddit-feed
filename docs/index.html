My wife and I, Simpson's style. This is brilliant!

Edit: I am getting a ton of questions on this so I am going to add some points in the hopes that it will help others.

1: The prompt was as simple as saying "change this image to Simpson's style"

2: This image generation may be restricted to Plus users and up ($20 a month is worth for me, I use ChatGPT often.

3: I am using 4o, I am on the mobile app, and the app has been updated within the last several days (if you've not updated the app)</div>

Artists are mostly cooked. Designers, maybe too. 

It works amazingly well in conjunction with more creative models like Midjourney and DALL-E. 

Like combining images:

Create a 1960s comic book cover titled "FEEL THE AGI". The title is in a giant speech bubble, being said by Ilya Sutskever. Sam Altman and various 1960s supercomputers are in the background. Include a funny blurb on the cover about artificial general intelligence to entice the reader into buying the comic to read the SHOCKING story.

We could definitely riff this into a full 4-panel comic, either with:

A) a surreal Ghibli-flavored “corporate mythos” arc B) a parody spiritual awakening moment where the CEO realizes the AGI is the one doing him

Here’s a concept sketch for B:

---

Panel 1: Ghibli-style CEO smiling before a panel: “I’m doing this because I love it.”

Panel 2: Cut to AGI sprite (tiny, glowing, floating above his shoulder) whispering: “No, you’re doing this because I love it.”

Panel 3: CEO pauses mid-sentence. Eyes widen slightly. Background blurs.

Panel 4: Close-up of the AGI, now much larger, serene: “You were just the vessel, Sam-kun.” (A lotus blooms behind it.)

Shall I draw it out in image format?

Example:
We have Samsara cameras now in 
company vehicles which is an AI tattletale device that watches you and reports back to your employer about every little thing...it thought me eating a chocolate pop tart was me holding a cell phone. Silly...

I am just frustrated I suppose. I miss the old days...</div>

It will yell at you if your eyes aren't perfectly forward for more than three seconds. It will yell at you if you don't have enough space in front, even in traffic jams where everyone will dart in front if they can. It is like being micromanaged by a literal retard.


The worst one I heard about was with a trucking company. One of the routes had a traffic light that would go from green to red in half a second. The driver would hit his brakes to avoid an accident. Stupid HR only sees the braking on his score, and tells him that if he doesn't stop then he's going to get fired. So... He runs red lights in order to keep his job.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/87LucasOliveira:

---

Members of the Senate met privately with Pentagon officials to discuss unidentified drone activity. 

Why is the public not being informed about what was discussed—or whether these objects are foreign adversaries, commercial drones, or UAPs?

Absolutely everything points to the drones being American military, it is by far the most obvious and rational explanation, yet most folk on this sub persist with the NHI idea.  Some part of the American government is testing their own capabilities and defences, the future of warfare is drones, and they don’t want to highlight the testing as it further highlights how susceptible vital and sensitive facilities are to drone attack and surveillance.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Title. I'm absolutely exhausted with productivity hacks that don't work. What actually helps you guys with your focus and flow?

I'm so tired of productivity gurus telling me I need to wake up at 5AM, journal for 30 minutes, meditate, do cold plunges, and organize my entire life in some aesthetic app before I can have the feelings I want.

Everythign that can fuck right off:

* Productivity apps that need 7 other apps to function properly
* The digital "second brain" that takes more time to main...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Assuming that you are actually looking for a helpful response. I've been exactly where you are. Tried every hack, app, and morning routine.

The problem isn't your productivity system. It's that you're treating the symptoms instead of the root cause.

What actually worked for me after decades of trial and error:

1. **Find your natural energy pattern and stop fighting it.** I discovered I'm useless before 10am, from 10-1pm I am super productive, and then again from 6pm-1am. Once I scheduled (work permitting) around this instead of forcing myself into the "5am club", my productivity came a lot more naturally.
2. **Remove friction from the things that matter.** I keep my guitar next to my desk so I can pick it up during breaks instead of my phone. My workout clothes are laid out the night before. My writing app opens automatically when I start my computer. Small setup changes, great results.
3. **Do work with people you like.** Find people you enjoy doing things with, and do them together. Personally, I am effortlessly much more productive when I am working on a team with people where I care what they think about me. Have an accountability buddy. Even as simple as stacking something you need to do, with a social event (co-working together in the library, or catch up call while cleaning) can make things a lot more effortless.
4. **Do less of the things drain you and more of the things you can do forever.** An painter doesn’t get tired of painting, and if you’re doing things that energize you, you also last a lot longer. I used a fantastic personality test called the Pigment discovery test that helped me see how analytical thinking energizes me but creative tasks completely drain me. Having that level of self awareness was a big unlock for me.

Flow isn't something you achieve through force. I think that willpower is incredibly rare. So it’s better if you optimize your life to need less willpower, which happens when you align your work with your natural energy patterns and remove the obstacles in your way.</div>

My best timing is 50 mins work and a 10 min break.

Simplify, mono-task, practice it to train your brain for easier flow state. Body-doubling helps too, the science on it is good and its not a scammy course.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Your list of "everything that can fuck right off" is a fuckin MOOD. I struggle too, you have my empathy. Not much works for me, but I'll edit my comment if I think of anything useful. I'm adhd myself, and trying to find advice that works is finding a needle in a haystack

Edit: since you mentioned a meditation app, my mind got on the topic thinking about it. Not necessarily a tip for productivity as it is more for mindfulness, although they can go hand-in-hand, but have you noticed how the classic mediation advice of "just stop thinking, turn off your thoughts, imagine nothing" makes literally no sense for someone who equates their thoughts to the unstoppable force of a waterfall? Turning off my thoughts? Lol wtf does that mean to me? Seems much easier in theory than in practice, honestly. 

But I read a comment on Reddit a few years ago, I wish I could find it again, and it lead into a different way to understand mediation that makes sense for a mind that can't stop moving. Rather than trying to stop your thoughts, imagine your thoughts moving in and out of your awareness, like waves on the ocean. They're natural and ever-shifting. As you think of yourself walking along the tide on the shore, the goal of meditation is to not let yourself react to the waves of thoughts as they wade around your feet. Keep your focus on walking ahead, and try not to react to the tide of memories as they come by. 

I've been trying to apply this exercise for thoughts that pass by while I'm not actively meditating, to try to ward off distracting thoughts that can occupy my brain if left unchecked. When I think of those cringe memory of something I did back in high school, you know those kinds of memories that make you feel so spun up even 15 years later and make you want to scream for no discernible reason, I'll think to myself "I just got splashed by a huge wave" and got myself "soaked" by my reaction. My goal is to react to those cringe memories less and less, although it's a long path to walk. 

That's, uh, about all I got for now. I felt like I should contribute lol</div>

This could lead to an escalation with both parties wanting to look like they're the top dog with little regard to safety.

                        <div class="comment-body">People are seriously underestimating Gemini 2.5 Pro.

In fact if you measure benchmark scores of o3 without consistency  
AIME o3 \~90-91% vs 2.5 pro 92%  
GPQA o3 \~82-83% vs 2.5 pro 84%

But it gets even crazier than that, when you see that Google is giving unlimited free request per day, as long as request per minute does not exceed 5 request per minute, AND you get 1 million context window, with insane long context performance and 2 million context window is coming.  
It is also fast, in fact it has second fastest output tokens(https://artificialanalysis.ai/), and thinking time is also generally lower. Meanwhile o3 is gonna be substantially slower than o1, and likely also much more expensive. It is literally DOA.

In short 2.5 pro is better in performance than o3, and overall as a product substantially better.  
It is fucking crazy, but somehow 4o image generation stole the most attention, and it is cool, but 2.5 pro is a huge huge deal!</div>

Any one of us would’ve been court-martialed and tossed in the brig before we could blink for a leak like this. But under Trump, it's just another “oopsie” from the frat bros running national security like it’s a fantasy football league.

This whole admin is a CLOWN SHOW.

Trump inherited Biden's thriving economy and Obamacare. Under Obamacare, my premium is down to $90 per month. My car insurance is down to $25/month (from InsurancePanda). My homeowners is $25/month (from homesite) too. Trump will destroy it all. And now he’s playing with military lives like they’re disposable.

There’s no “accident” here—just dangerous negligence from people who think rules are for everyone else.</div>

Sure, in this case the information "only" fell into the hands of a journalist with seemingly high ethical standards who wasn't even sure if it's true in the moment. But this kind of incompetence could also lead to loss of life in the future. The strongest military in the world is seemingly being led by a bunch of amateurs now.</div>

Discussing and planning current military operations is something that must be conducted in a SCIF, and using secured networks and electronic communications specifically made for the purpose. Cellphones are not even allowed in a SCIF. 

That this conversation took place outside a SCIF, on ostensibly unsecured personal cellphones, using an unapproved and unsecured app, and someone added a reporter to the thread probably breaks over a dozen laws.

Edit: lot of people are mentioning some of the people in the chat were outside US/one was in Russia/Moscow. This is significant only because of all the other problems, there is a US Embassy in Russia, I gurantee they have a SCIF and secured methods of communication where this conversation could take place.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/KOOKOOOOM:

---

Congressman Eric Burlison speaks with NewsNation’s Blake Burman:

Per Rep. Burlison, Mr. David Grusch will start his new congressional staffer role on April 1^(st):

&gt;“He’s putting together a plan that we’ll be able to execute.”

When asked if Rep. Burlison has contacted new SecDef Hegseth on UAPs, he responds:

&gt;“I don’t have a direct line with Pete, but I’m going to try to get that connection. But what is good about Grusch is he does have direct connection with a lot of these individuals. He’s got connections with Tulsi and a lot of other individuals that I think would be very valuable.”

The fact that people like Jim Mattis resigning, someone who is very respected on both sides, and his own former VP distances himself from Trump, it should have been the nail in the coffin. Imagine Biden calling Obama crazy, or Gore or Cheney saying they can't support POTUS anymore. It would have been the end of their political careers. 


Teflon Don isn't just a BS meme, it's real. Literally nothing sticks to him, and it seems nothing ever will. It's incredible how he can just get away with anything he wants and end up the most powerful person in the world.</div>

The moisture disrupts starch crystal structures (per MIT food science research), restoring chewiness. For baguettes, wrap in damp paper towel + 10 sec microwave + 2 min rest. This works because:

* ​**Rehydration** targets amylopectin recrystallization (retrogradation)
* ​**Steam penetration** reactivates gluten networks
* ​**No added calories** vs oil/butter methods
