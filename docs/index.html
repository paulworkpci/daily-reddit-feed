                    <div class="comment-body">It’s honestly so interesting reading some of these comments. I’ve been part of this subreddit since maybe 2015 if I’m not wrong. It’s been a while but since following this subreddit I’ve been so astounded by how much we have developed AI and to sit back and see people scoff at the progression we have made is mind blowing. Zoom out and see just how much has changed in so little time. It’s absolutely amazing. Everyone keeps saying that it’s not good enough and being negative towards something that literally didn’t exist two years ago and now we have models at Ph.D level intelligence and reasoning. I remember when I followed this subreddit everything that is happening now was just a distant dream in my mind and now, much sooner than I thought it would occur, AGI is starting to reveal itself and I’m in absolute awe that as a species we are capable of producing this intelligence that I hope we utilize to produce boundless benefit for humanity.</div>

That is the reason people call AI useless. They don't want it to happen. Because human life is only as valuable as the economic value it provides in a capitalist system.</div>

                <div class="post-content">By "people," I’m referring to those who argue things like:

* "O3’s compute costs are too high."
* "Models still can't solve basic questions (e.g., the infamous Rs test)."
* "ARC-AGI isn’t a true measure of AGI."
* "We’ve exhausted all data and will hit a wall soon.".....

You’re missing the bigger picture here. The **BIGGEST** takeaway from O3’s release is that AI progress isn’t slowing, it’s accelerating. O3 was launched just three months after O1! And cost per unit of intelligence is reducing...</div>

It's like computer CPUs and clock rate limit. Yes, we found a limit it's difficult to go over, but everybody who knows anything understands a *single core* of a modern i9 is at least two orders of magnitude faster at doing calculations (FLOPs) than a Pentium 4 from 20 years ago, even with the same clock rate.

I believe it's the same with AI models. Yes, we will find limits (like the amount of training data), but other avenues of research will keep improving the models.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">The data wall is also very temporary. Models until now have blindly consumed internet data en mass. Now effort will go into evaluating the value/quality of the data that is consumed. And with that ability you can start training on generated LLM data, because yeah maybe 95% the data will degenerate the model, but from randomness there will be some 5% that is really good, and if the models can learn on that it can self improve, in essence like AlphaZero in chess and AlphaGo in Go.

There are three ways this evaluation function will take place:

* Self evaluation, heuristics, and automated evaluation. Kind of like the discriminator in GANs. Where this works, it will be blazing fast.
* The market of ideas. Kind of like reddit upvotes. Meh, speed.
* Usefulness at completing tasks. If the data you consumed made you better at making money/gaining compute then that was good data. You outcompete other models. Slow.

If you can glean an evolutionary process in there, it is not by accident. In any case you'll not see any wall, maybe a less exponential growth rate compared to the era of "free" data, but there will still be data.</div>

Yes, it's nice if you can train an AI on the answer to every conceivable question, but in order to do that you need to have the questions already answered, which is what the AI is for, so you have a chicken-and-egg problem. For the AI to answer *novel* questions (and thus build up the body of high-quality data in a significant way, not to mention actually advance civilization), what it needs is directed creative reasoning, not more training data within already-known domains.</div>

                    <div class="comment-body">I think that at some point, improvement in AI intelligence becomes increasingly difficult for the average human to judge. For the average question to ChatGPT, it doesn’t really matter if you’d use 4o, o1 or o3 - the answers are generally adequate across the board. What looks like stagnation is just most people being unable to keep up with the types of problems AI is now starting to tackle. Like, whenever a new model comes out these days, I always think “oh boy, let’s see how smart this one is!” and then I find myself unable to come up with any clever riddle or test. We’re in some kind of uncanny valley of intelligence where the closer it gets to human intelligence, the less we’re impressed because now instead of appearing to us as a very smart robot, the AI feels like a below-average human.

I am absolutely convinced that AI will go way past human level intelligence within the decade and no doomerism can convince me otherwise. Hell, even if it doesn’t, every single industry has yet to catch up to implementing all of the possibilities that new AI architectures offer.</div>

I'm an AI engineer and automating even simple tasks is a pain in the ass as they have so many failure modes - the success still depends on the skill of the prompter to cover a large list of failure modes, rather than the intrinsic skill of the model.

They might be able to solve logical puzzles, but they still fail at parsing simple text to extract relevant pieces of information with 99% accuracy</div>

Here's a quick summary: Tech companies overspent on AI and are now seeing diminishing returns a.k.a. we are hitting a wall.

To me (and I think to many of you guys), 12/20/24 is the day AGI was externally proven/verified to the world.

That's ALL cope. Literally no other group of people on the internet (or even real life) other than r/singularity believes in that. And you guys believe in that because you WANT it to become true, and by telling yourselves that over and over again it helps you sleep better at night, thus copium.

Look, the bottom line is that the cope goes both ways. Yes, the public copes about AI, but to pretend that THIS subreddit *doesn't* is absolutely absurd and arrogant.</div>

Same deal with AI.

It would be interesting to graph out the workstyle of people who do and don't find value in AI for their work. My suspicion is that the kind of person who sits down and draws up a list of requirements with pen and paper before writing the first line of code will tend to not gel well with AI. Whereas people like me who are happy to get stuck in with a dirty first draft and revise it later appreciate how quickly LLMs let you iterate.</div>

Everyone forgets tool use capability of agentic AI.

Imagine something like 4o as an agent. Ask it to do anything. It can farm out to o3, or a robot, or it can take over your interface and use whatever tool you can! Or it can have its own interface with interoperable toolset. 

In order for that to happen, you need the basics. Seems to be that o3 hits the mark on cognitive basics, but we are still lacking that understanding spacially for robotics.

That implies if they are generally intelligent enough, sooner or later they will probably be able to make any tool to do those simple things just like humans can, for instance, build cars to move faster than the fastest humans ever. Of course, cost and efficiency are also important factors that need a lot of work to improve.</div>

If you took Amazon Alexa back to 1982 and showed it to people, it would have passed the turing test. That’s because it’s simply testing *what people expect* a machine is capable of. But a lot of people in popular sci-fi culture associated it with living in something like an Isaac Asimov novel.

So when Altman and others were talking about how we had passed the turing test a year or two ago and no one cared… Well, because it told us that LLMs had made progress that most people wouldn’t have expected… but didn’t really change anything. And right now the attitude in this subreddit is “But in the next 2 years/5 years, you wait and see!” Okay, I agree that many things will be effected over the coming years.

I just don’t see that that even an AI which could solve every math problem in existence is going to solve the majority of problems and challenges humanity is facing. These tend to be rooted in competing ethical and political visions. Where’s the bar chart on o3s progress there?</div>

There are so many definitions of AGI that it's meaningless. Some define it as doing better than human at cognitive tasks, some include a degree of world competency (robotics, world model), some even have consciousness in there even though it isn't necessary for any useful use of AI except maybe improving our understanding of what consciousness is (i.e neurobiology).

It feels like all the pieces exist in one lab or another, and in 2025 we will see these pieces put together one way or another:

\-OpenAI has the lead on test-time compute and long outputs

\-Meta seemingly has ways to move beyond natural language to bring abstract reasoning to models

\-Anthropic has the best base model, superior tooling (MCP, Computer use) and better coding and UI design performance

\-Google has long context windows and efficiency

Even if 2025 brought no new frontier but just brought those together, that would be a game changer that meets my definition of AGI. Because from here, adding new capabilities doesn't require new breakthroughs, it just requires codifying whatever capability into something that models can use as training data.

Anthropic's computer use is an interesting example of this, they're trying to brute force the ability to use a computer by codifying that otherwise abstract data using screenshots. One can imagine this will soon become streaming screen sharing, and voila, new modality learned, no breakthrough required, just curating datasets to teach it. Rinse and repeat for any capability that you want AI to do.

  
That's the exciting thing about where we're heading, we're able to generalize learning itself.

By the time we end up with a consensus AGI, we'll be WELL into ASI territory for many people and honestly, all practically useful scenarios.</div>

Software development, engineering, mathmatics, physics, everything is going to start moving at breathtaking speed.

AGI isn't going to take over the world like some people fear.  Instead it is going to accelerate progress in many many different areas of software, science and technology.  It will allow companies and individuals to go from idea to product in seconds instead of years, and for pennies instead of millions.

The jobs of the future won't be low level developers anymore.  The jobs instead will be creative thinkers and creative designers working at speeds that seem impossible, doing things that nobody has even imagined before.  The limit is only what we can dream, and the future is going to come faster than anyone thought it would.</div>

Seems like just like with coding and creative writing, reasoning is easier to do than generalized thinking, meaning we will likely see ML research and agentic self improvement before we figure out AGI, and then a model will smash it's way to general superintelligence. So instead of the slowly accelerating various industries, it will seem like AI is slowing down, then boom, soft ASI.</div>

Now, it's nothing but "will await your apology", "look at this cope", "no one cares what is happening", "keep shifting the goalposts" etc

Why? You are preaching to the choir on this sub. If your random workmate doesn't care about AI then that's okay.

Can we stick to actual discussions and news rather than this constant circlejerk? </div>

I don't think it's unique to this sub, I think it's across the entire platform.

I think they are optimizing for engagement and controversy.   The types of posts you describe check two boxes "yeah, I agree! Op is me!" And "I hate this...but I have to click to see what these idiots are saying"

I think this because I used to just see nerdy niche posts about my hobbies and top trending news.

Now what I see constantly are what I can only describe as rage bait "articles" and political posts.   I honestly don't care about the latest Elon tweet or trump drama or one more post about how x y or z is on the right side of history.  

I barely recognize what reddit has become.   I've had to mute and show me less x y z more in the past few months than at any other point in my reddit history.   

The worst part is that whenever I do engage in these threads I just try to present some moderate centrist view that would be totally normal IRL and I just get piled on with downvotes and comments that affirm whatever sort of narrative is being pushed.   

I mean seriously what is going on?   Has reddit succumb to the disinfo divisive bots that seems to be invading the entire web or has the user base really just started gravitating to controversy.</div>

                    <div class="comment-body">o3 answer is literally the most logically correct choice based on examples. In no example is there are blue line touching a red piece, so by omission you would expect that a block only turns blue by piercing, instead of making up a rule that is not shown in the first place as in the correct answer. You could say that this is ambigious, but I honestly just think that o3's answer is the correct choice here, and the actual "correct choice" is making up a rule that is not shown. I think that some logic of the rule can also be derived from omission rather than needing to actually show an example.

There are other things to this puzzle like realizing that things on top edge only go down and things on left edge only go right. I think this is an impressive case where unfamiliarity with the concepts gave an edge over humans, while humans find rules and logic that is not existent in the first place. Many people say puzzles like these are out of distribution of humans, but the vast amount of visual knowledge and patterns we've seen, make puzzles like these pretty familiar to us, and do not rely on out-of-distribution generalization, but patterns we've seen in real life. 

o3 is also given a text output, which is what I think is the real difficulty of this test. They are given this totally weird format that the ai's have absolutely never seen before, and probably have difficulty tokenizing, let alone finding patterns in, while the visual representations are very familiar for humans. 

I really think people are overestimating the out-of-distribution generalization that humans do.</div>

You could just as easily argue that the examples not including the edge case is evidence that the author didn't realize the ambiguity.


There is no single correct way to generalize from incomplete data. Multiple distinct rules, patterns, or processes could generate the example results, and there is no a priori reason to prefer any one of them without imposing additional assumptions...</div>

A former NASA astronaut has come forward to reveal that he personally witnessed 'two metallic spherical orbs' whizz by his plane this August while flying above Texas.

Leroy Chiao, who served as the commander of Expedition 10 to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2004 and 2005, was 9,000 feet in the air when objects 'zipped' on the left side of his airplane.

He said one flew on top of the other and each was about three feet in diameter.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/RainbowAl-PE:

---

Weeks ago I first witnessed an unexplainable phenomenon in the sky above the Northumberland Strait, and have since been watching intently while recording anything I can. Some recordings have captured huge numbers or 0rbs in single frames, also a larger object apparently emitting dozens of 0rbs at a time. 

Now, I'm beginning to see similar numbers and formations to corroborate what has been until now a seemingly unique experience on my part. These objects are not there every night, nor in the same place twice, and move of their own volition. They are not stars, planes, or satellites. 

I am compiling these for comparison, and hoping imlbe hit the character requirements for a submission statement.

SS: Montvale, NJ Mayor Mike Ghassali reports that he has spoken with a credible witness whose son attempted to fly his own drone up to one of the mysterious drones. Upon approach, he claims that the drone was "drone-jacked" and disappeared into the sky. He suggests that this is an example of the highly-advanced counter measures that some of these drones are demonstrating.

That being said, I also have experience with GPS jamming equipment the public wouldn't usually be exposed to, and think it's not unreasonable to imagine a consumer drone being equipped with such a thing and causing other drones to go haywire, especially since our own drone intercept technologies oftentimes rely on drones of their own that aren't controlled by humans.

Edit: There's a lot of inferring to do here, but this is a good benchmark of what our military is currently working with when it comes to drone intercept tech

In fact Gary Nolan has possession of some of this material from the Ubatuba UFO incident from Brazil in 1957. Remember also that Elizondo said, a while back, that the exterior "skin" of a UFO may actually be it's propulsion mechanism, and that it sheds it as it moves. It always reminds me of a Sacrificial Anode placed on a boat that is there specifically to corrode and protect the rest of the metallic surfaces from corroding.</div>

SS: Ross Coulthart's reaction to the Times article that was [shared earlier on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1hj846s/drones_over_uks_american_airbases_may_be/). In a separate tweet, [he reportedly stated that he has been told by his informants that the size of some of these drones/UAP is staggering](https://x.com/MetaStudioLogic/status/1870269599440396436), describing them as "nation state" sized. That certainly sounds a bit larger than the "SUV" description that has been widely reported.

If "...the size of...these drones/UAP is staggering..." and then they are described as "..."nation state" sized," that would mean they are the size of a nation-state. It wouldn't make sense to then assume he is saying that only a nation-state could build them. Yeah, it doesn't make sense since countries come in all sorts of different sizes but that is what he is saying.</div>

James Fox also gives a shoutout to our Reddit community and says, “Will post full 3 hour link later. Listen to this.”

ET Shuts Down Nuclear Missile Sites l Captain Robert Salas of Air Force Academy

Capt. Salas graduated from the Air Force Academy and spent seven years in active duty from 1964 to 1971. He testifies about a UFO incident on the morning of March 16, 1967 where 16 nuclear missiles simultaneously became non-operational at two different launch facilities immediately after guards saw UFOs hovering above. The guards could not identify these objects even though they were only 30 feet away.

This as well:

                        <div class="reply-body">Having read both Hastings’ and Salas’ books on UFO/UAP nuclear cases it is almost unreal how similar those cases are to some of these incidents happening today!

White/red orbs flying randomly at low altitudes around/over nuclear bases/weapons, nuclear missile silos, nuclear ships/subs, nuclear power plants, etc. 

The other similarity is the guards/police that put a flashlight or spotlight on the orbs, they turn the lights off instantly, going dark, move to a further distance away from the light source and then turn lights back on; all instantaneously!</div>

There’s a few “must reads” and this is one of them. 

My take is the current UAP audience isn’t as interested in the literature that’s out there and regards anything that wasn’t made after 2017 as outdated. There’s a reason a lot of “names” in the space say things like “it’s all out there you just have to put it together”. There’s a very consistent story across very different books. 

In addition to UFOs and Nukes” the Richard Dolan books “UFOs and the national security state” are must reads IMO. 

To me those cover the nuts and bolts side. Then you can move into Jacques Valle to wade into “woo” and go any direction you want with that because there’s a lot. I happen to believe they’re all connected but many don’t. 

Either way good path to learning</div>

The use of passive language to control narratives is on people's radar because of the reporting of the recent Israel/Palestine conflict. In Israel "children were slaughtered" while in Palestine "people under 18 died". The [Guardian](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F_yYaerWQAAl5UN.jpg) did it, the [Associated Press](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQLup68X_C89JtTiPhX3dLshS3tz8LHSKu_IA&amp;s) did it, there have also been breakdowns the language used by outlets such as the [NYT, WAPO, and LAT](https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/gaza-media-chart-2-rev-1.png?w=1000).

Even the post by OP has some pretty complicated history. There is an implication the Telegraph is trying to 'hide' the fact this could be an Islamic terror attack, but that in itself is probably a bit of overcorrection because traditionally the media has over-covered Islamic terror compared to Christian / White Nationalist terror. 

There are a lot of ways a newspaper can influence opinions while being completely truthful in their reporting, and there does need to be a more consistent standard held by news outlets.</div>

Yes, Kamala and prominent Democrats take money from billionaires and they probably get some influence from that. The alternative is to get outspent like crazy every cycle and have a perpetual Republican supermajority. 

I don’t know many liberals cheerleading billionaire money in politics, but I see lots of conservatives (including in this sub) really excited about Elon purchasing influence and flaunting it. There are people who think that because they’re financially successful, they deserve to drive policy. There’s not an altruistic bone in most of their bodies. They are smart and capable, but they don’t give a fuck about making your life better. 

We should all have a problem with it and we should all take politicians to task, regardless of affiliation. It’s one of the single biggest issues in America and the modern world.</div>
