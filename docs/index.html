Stole this post from another sub, but  it is intresting discussion imo   
  
Did anyone else see this new Fiverr ad aimed at "vibe coders"?

But the core message actually hit: there‚Äôs a point in every ‚Äújust-for-fun‚Äù build where I either push through 20 more hours of debugging or I bring in help.

Not saying the ad is perfect  it's still an ad but it did make me reflect on how many of my side projects die at 95%.

Anyone...</div>

* AI Studio
* ChatGPT
* Claude
* DeepSeek

To theoretically reach 100 ŒºM psilocin in plasma, a 77 kg person would need to ingest ~5.5 grams of pure psilocybin, assuming 100% bioavailability and complete conversion (which does not happen in reality). Oral bioavailability of psilocybin is ~50% or less. Keep in mind mushrooms are 1.5% psilocybin.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is way beyond my level but this is what Gemini says about your comment. I'm just trying to understand if this is actually something a human could replicate or not.



Let's break down the Reddit user's statement and compare it to the information in the study to see if it's "wrong."
The Reddit user is attempting to calculate an oral dose of psilocybin mushrooms to achieve a plasma concentration of 100~\mu M psilocin in a human. This is where the core difference lies in their interpretation versus the study's design.
Here's why the Reddit user's premise, while attempting a calculation, is not directly aligned with the study's reported findings or objectives for in vivo (mouse) to human translation:
 * In Vitro vs. In Vivo Dosing:
   * The 100~\mu M concentration was used for psilocin in the in vitro (cell culture) experiments. This means it was the concentration in the cell growth medium, directly surrounding the cells. It is not a plasma concentration achieved through ingestion in a living organism.
   * The mouse study (in vivo) used psilocybin at doses of 5~\text{mg/kg} and 15~\text{mg/kg}. These are ingested doses for a whole animal, leading to a systemic (e.g., plasma) concentration that the researchers aimed to make comparable to human clinical trials.
 * The Study's Translation Method:
   * The study explicitly states that the mouse dose of 5.14~\text{mg/kg} was modeled based on a clinical study where patients received 25 mg of psilocybin. This is the method they used for in vivo translation to human clinical relevance. They did not attempt to achieve a specific plasma concentration equivalent to the in vitro 100~\mu M level.
   * The 15~\text{mg/kg} mouse dose was then chosen to account for the faster metabolism of psilocin in mice compared to humans, ensuring "sufficient systemic exposure comparable to those observed in human clinical trials". Again, the goal was not to replicate the in vitro 100~\mu M level in human plasma.
 * Feasibility of 100~\mu M Plasma Psilocin:
   * The Reddit user's calculation highlights the extremely high amount of pure psilocybin (5.5 grams) needed to even theoretically approach a 100~\mu M plasma concentration, acknowledging that this is unrealistic due to bioavailability and conversion issues. This underscores why the in vitro concentrations are not practical targets for in vivo human dosing.
   * Typical psychedelic doses in human clinical trials, as hinted by the 25 mg reference, are far, far lower than what would be needed to reach 100~\mu M in plasma.
Conclusion:
The Reddit user's statement is not directly relevant to the study's in vivo (mouse) to human dose translation, and therefore, their premise for calculating the dose is "wrong" in the context of what the study actually aimed to achieve in live organisms.
The study's goal in the mouse experiments was to mimic clinically relevant human doses, not to achieve the 100~\mu M cellular concentration in the bloodstream of a living being. The 100~\mu M dose was a valuable part of the in vitro mechanism elucidation, showing dose-dependent effects on cells in a controlled environment. However, it's a very different context from a systemic concentration in a human.</div>

AI is evolving incredibly fast, and robots are nearing their "iPhone moment", the point when they become widely useful and accessible. However, I don't think this breakthrough will initially come through advanced humanoid robots, as they're still too expensive and not yet practical enough for most households. Instead, our first widespread AI interactions are likely to be with affordable and approachable social robots like this one.

I really want this thing to not just be a commercial success, but to also have an overall positive impact.

I think the main use case will be a physical interface for chatGPT (or another AI). But I'm more excited about using this platform for teaching robotics/engineering/programming.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thanks! The sounds and movements were made by my colleagues, some of the emotions are really on point!

What we do is we give the AI the list of emotion names and descriptions, for example:  
  
yes\_sad1 -&gt; A melancholic ‚Äúyes‚Äù. Can also be used when someone repeats something you already knew, or a resigned agreement.

amazed1 -&gt; When you discover something extraordinary. It could be a new robot, or someone tells you you've been programmed with new abilities. It can also be when you admire what someone has done.

  
So these descriptions are quite "oriented". The LLM also has a prompt that gives the robot its "personality".</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Actually the population of Palm Beach island is very small, and old money. Not a ton of ‚Äúfamous‚Äù people live there tho I am sure it has its share of billionaires. There‚Äôs very little space, and it‚Äôs not welcoming at all to newbies. Trump technically isn‚Äôt supposed to be residing at Mar A Lago per the agreement which allowed him to purchase it. Yet another agreement he has ignored to do whatever he wanted.
Anyway, PB is not a party town like the Hamptons, everything is pretty much closed after 8 and it‚Äôs very quiet and dark. It‚Äôs also an island with few ways to get on and off of it. I would say it‚Äôs the perfect place to live if you‚Äôre a person who wishes to prey on younger women without a lot of neighbors to see what you‚Äôre up to, and nowhere for them to go if they decide to leave against your wishes. It‚Äôs not like Miami Beach. It‚Äôs very family oriented which makes it even more odd that that a bachelor and party type would want to live there. The Palm Beach County Sheriff‚Äôs Office was very ‚Äúturn a blind eye‚Äù which I‚Äôm sure held appeal for both men.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It was an Isreali intelligence operation, the evidence is astounding.

Robert Maxwell met Jeffrey Epstien during Iran Contra.

Ari Ben Menash who broke the Iran contra scandal to the media claims that Robert was responsible for the operation, and to have met Jeffrey Epstein several times in Robert Maxwells office during this period.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari\_Ben-Menashe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Ben-Menashe)

Epstein left his position at Bear Stearns and worked with Adnan Kashoggi during this period, one of the key middleman in the  Iran-Contra scheme.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan\_Khashoggi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Khashoggi)

Ghislaine was introduce to Jeffrey by her father Robert Maxwell.

Her father Robert worked with republican former congressmen John Tower to also sell spywear disguised as accounting software to several sensitive nucluer sites in the USA.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert\_Maxwell#Distribution\_of\_PROMIS\_software\_to\_facilitate\_Israeli\_spying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Maxwell#Distribution_of_PROMIS_software_to_facilitate_Israeli_spying)

Guess who was put in charge of investigating Iran Contra by GW1?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower\_Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Commission)

Robert Maxwell was found dead in the ocean after taking his boat out alone one night, Jeffrey Epstien committed suicide and John tower died in a plane crash.

It genuinely wild just how well documented and obvious the entire thing is.</div>

Keep the people divided, distracted, infighting, instead of aligning on this 1 simple god damn thing ... but nooooooo UBI is bad because "insert stupid reason xxxx"

I stumbled on an article 5 months ago where he claimed that, 3-6 months from now, AI would be writing 90% of all code. We only have one month to go to evaluate his prediction.

https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-ceo-ai-90-percent-code-3-to-6-months-2025-3

How far are we from his prediction? Is AI writing even 50% of code?

The AI2027 people indirectly based most of their predictions on Dario's predictions.</div>

No signs of those mysterious general intelligences yet.  

We do have some totally bitching image, video, and music models though. And I do like tab-tab code autocomplete. Even if it can't do my job yet.</div>

I was a loyal Claude subscriber paying $200/month for their coding plan. For months it was solid, but lately? Man, it‚Äôs been making some really dumb mistakes. Like, basic syntax errors, forgetting context mid-conversation, suggesting deprecated APIs. I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre running a quantized version now because the quality drop ...</div>

I still like Claude as a tool. It was the first GOOD agentic model.  Much of the ecosystem has been sort of tailored to Claude...which is a problem.

But anyway, I'm not poor, but it's nice to feel like I can afford to use something.</div>

Don't get me wrong. I use a lot of different LLMs for my solutions but I would need to know better your setup and solution use. Kimi K2 was impressive for us one hit wonders but it dies in the world.of maintaining a cosebase. I have yet to see anything that can build and maintain a large and complex codebase outside of a great agent and claide/gemini 2.5 before update. 

I would love for you to share before I  waste my time on another llm that about gets it but not yet.</div>

If GLM 4.5 is producing code that can match Opus, then I suspect you‚Äôre not using Opus correctly or it is complete overkill for the problems you‚Äôre attempting to tackle.

Engines post-fuel efficiency laws are engineering marvels for the amount of power they generate vs the fuel the consume. Plus, the vast majority of them can make it to 200k miles without major issues as long as you keep up with maintenance. All of them are so complicated there are bound to be duds now and then.

                        <div class="comment-body">IDF snipers targetted men, women, and CHILDREN before the war and oct 7th attacks. They'd even shoot them in the groin as to permanently disable them. Often it would be unarmed protesters. This was done on purpose and if whistleblower testimony is to be believed, it was sanctioned and directed by higher ups (secretly).

Its not JUST lone psychopaths murdering innocent civilians, this practice is condoned by higher ups and soldiers rarely face consequences unless it becomes a huge public thing.

People don't realize how EVIL the israel government IS and HAS been towards Palestinians.

EDIT : Someone said this video was from 2018. Which only further illustrates my point. Oct 7th attacks should be condemned, but there was motivation behind the attacks. Although, I fear, these attacks only played into the Israel Gov.' agenda. As they likely knew the attacks were coming and they could use such attacks to demolish palestine for good and maybe even take out Iran.</div>

&gt;¬†it can exercise its jurisdiction only when national courts are unwilling or unable to prosecute criminals.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court


So there is a strong incentive to literally investigate themselves and find nothing wrong. Or give light sentences to say they did something.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I did Royal Marine Commando training and we learned very early to perfect what we called our "pain face". You see whenever doing any kind of physical training we were expected to give 100% and I really mean 100%. If we weren't on the brink of near collapse from exhaustion then that meant we weren't giving it 100%. So we started to perfect a pain face where we made it look like we were giving it our absolute all to the point we were in complete agony from over exertion even though really we were secretly saving ourselves so we could keep going during later tasks. If we had looked like we were coping with things easily they would have just kept going. My point is that if you're lucky enough to find your work easy then you really should make it look like you are actually working so hard that it's killing you but that's just how committed you are. The sad fact is people can't stand it if it looks like you're having an easier time at work than they are. People feel better if they think at least they are not having to work as hard as you are.</div>
