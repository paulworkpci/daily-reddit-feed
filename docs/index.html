I used to set goals like “write every day” or “work out more,” then wonder why I wasn’t doing them. Turns out, goals are vibes. Systems are calendars, timers, reminders, and zero guesswork.

1. Removing cues for bad habits. I love playing games but I’m really focussed on my work and it was starting to get in the way. So I’ve decided to sell the console and get that habit out. 

2. Being comfortable with being uncomfortable. This was huge for me. Your habits are sometimes just boring! But you need to be ok with that if you want to achieve your long term goal. We are hard wired for instant gratification</div>

YT link is a new interview of Richard Dolan by Vinnie Adams (from Disclosure Team).

Some interesting discussion about USOs (Unidentified Submersible Objects), and why beings from elsewhere might choose to go underwater (for example: better solar radiation shielding).

You can't do anything with ignorance, but you CAN do something with knowledge. 

It doesn't even matter if we can change the thing we know about - we can still change us! 

History is FILLED with tremendous stories of people who changed themselves when they couldn't change their situation. Instead of rolling over they rose to the occasion. Being in jail, the Holocaust, the wrong color at the wrong time in history, etc - how important people responded to these situations MADE history when all they could change was themselves. 

Maybe we're a prison planet. Maybe we're the Galactic equivalent of cave men. Maybe we're a test tube race. Maybe we're food. Maybe we're in a simulator. We can't change various horrible versions of reality but knowing the reality means we can change our approach to the situation.</div>

I think what he's cautioning against is what will happen when we come in contact. 

Which i can understand, anything can happen. Literally anything.

But if there is something out there we absolutely should at least know about it.

We have been waiting for so long for anything about this subject that we already came out with almost all the negative possibilites involving aliens and us.  

•They can annhilate us maybe? Ok big deal everyone on the planet is already doomed to die.  

•We are an experiment for them maybe? Ok does not really change anything except we now know who created us.  

•The possibility that they listen to our thoughts and can implants new ideas in our brains? So I am not really free but they are so subtle that we don't really see any difference, not such a big deal then.  

•Soul prison after death maybe? So they are just testing us, they know how we are but they keep the experiment running just so they can imprison our soul based on our thoughts or just for pure malice? They'd have a lot of souls just giving up eventually and they'd essentially run out. (I got honestly no idea about this one, I"m guessing eventually you're free if you follow what they want?)   

•They don't really care about us? Ok so nothing changes.

You guys gotta help me because I can't figure out any single scenario where this becomes a problem for me.  

I don't even see torture for eternity as a problem because eventually stoiscism just kicks in and like maybe the universe evntually collapse on itself and I forget everything about the torture part of my life?  

Where/when does it matter?  

Does it just matters if they somehow decided that they'd help us out and that would be the actual ontological shock? That we're not doomed for eternity or something?  That like, they figured something out, that the Universe wont destroy itself and that they came in peace to give us the technology to explore said infinite Universe (be it medical or digital/mechanical)?</div>

gen-z (and older people too) have had their attentions spans stolen.  they didn't give them away.

this is the modern world that our billionaire overlords want.  pacified people sitting at home, consuming through their phones, and not building any social cohesion in the real world.

because real world social cohesion leads to collective action, which leads to resistance to fascism and oligarchic takeovers.

Recent studies suggest that Generation Z (born approximately 1997–2012) may be the first generation to experience a decline in certain cognitive abilities compared to previous cohorts. This trend contrasts with the "Flynn Effect," observed throughout the 20th century, where each new generation scored higher on IQ tests than the last.​

[https://www.thetimes.com/article/young-losing-their-iq-advantage-over-old-k3pg2j8pj?utm\_source=chatgpt.com](https://www.thetimes.com/article/young-losing-their-iq-advantage-over-old-k3pg2j8pj?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

A study by Northwestern University researchers analyzed intelligence testing data from 2006 to 2018, revealing declines in three out of four cognitive domains: verbal reasoning, matrix reasoning, and letter and number series. Interestingly, spatial reasoning scores increased during the same period. ​

We literally just suck lol. only generation to actively fair out worse, than previous generations. And honestly? I don't sympathize with my generation anymore. Nobody is forcing us on social media, we weren't "born" into this, we fully choose what we do with our own autonomy. Gen Z is old enough now to take responsibility for shit. we're getting close to our 30s on the older side.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Correct. And they don't want to do anything because it wasn't a mistake. 

We now have insight into the parameters that were used to remand people to prison in a foreign country that is not their own.

According to a court filing, they used a points system. There were, of course, items that had to do with existing criminal charges, but one could have NO previous interaction with the law whatsoever and still score high enough to be sent. 

If you were a Venezuelan over the age of 14 who had a tattoo that included a crown, star, clock or several other common symbols - including a silhouette of Michael Jordan (!), you got four points. 

You could get four more points for wearing attire associated with TdA, which includes " athletic wear," or  "high-end urban streetwear" including Jordan sneakers. 

Eight points is the threshold to be remanded to El Salvador. 

This was not a mistake. This is by design.

And they just sent another plane, despite injunctions:

It looks like he is getting pretty close to beating [Strom Thurmonds's record of 24 hours and 18 minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strom_Thurmond_filibuster_of_the_Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957#:~:text=Thurmond%20was%20also%20allowed%20breaks,the%20Senate%20as%20of%202025.)  Not sure how productive it is but at least he isn't reading the ~~phone book or~~ something silly to keep going.

  
Edit: Researching this and it appears that the stories of reading the phone book are apocryphal.  I couldn't find anything to support that claim.  I skimmed through the [Congressional Record](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/Thurmond_filibuster_1957.pdf) and it appears that he read state laws on civil rights to try to claim that a national law was unnecessary and a bunch of historical documents.  It was probably boring enough to anyone in the audience that most of it was only marginally more interesting than the phone book.</div>

Edit: by 50% I'm talking about women. We're missing the historical contribution of half the human race because of how they were silenced and treated as nothing but cattle except for very rare occasions.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;“A significant part of Republican immigration policy centers on the possibility of deporting 12 million people (or ‘self-deporting’ them),” Vance wrote. “Think about it: we conservatives (rightly) mistrust the government to efficiently administer business loans and regulate our food supply, yet we allegedly believe that it can deport millions of unregistered aliens. The notion fails to pass the laugh test. The same can be said for too much of the party’s platform.”

He's spent literally hours and hours over the course of over a decade describing billionaires and politicians as self interested ghouls whose only goal is to gain as much power and wealth as possible....but literally the second the billionaires and politicians start inviting him out to dinner and hanging out with him it turns out that actually, the billionaires and politicians are pretty cool and just misunderstood!</div>

I don't get why people are so outraged about the generative art, *if* the only meaning in art ultimately derived from making the art. If you can draw a portrait of someone with a pencil or charcoal (I can) now, then you'll still be able to do that in the future. If what's important is the actual actions of that, then AI art changes nothing.


What they don't want to admit this was always an emotional argument based entirely on "I can't make money anymore with my art." I totally get why that is really scary. Except, I don't. Because even though I think the days of making money drawing up logos in Illustrator for small businesses is most certainly over, I believe the days of truly independent movie makers, real auteurs, is right around the corner. I always wanted to direct a movie. I think other creatives will find a new niche as well, and as for the rest, creativity is rare.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don’t entirely agree it’s fear-driven.  

I think that’s only part of it. In an uncaring world that was already hard for artists, it’s only going to get tougher for those artists without some intervention, which probably won’t happen.   

There’s another part of the equation that’s about the time, dedication and effort of human creativity. But if a piece has that, it still doesn’t make it good. And this is maybe the main issue artists have (although to be fair, if the only thing someone is bringing to the equation is time, they might not be that great of an artist). 

There’s a book called simulacra and simulation that talks about the precession of simulacra, which is the representation of symbols in art. At some point, ideas just build upon each other to the point where they’re abstracted from reality in any meaningful way. Trying to explain to a caveman the picture of Marylin Monroe holding her skirt down requires a huge amount of cultural context. Explaining memes to someone that hasn’t been plugged into the meme side of the internet is a huge undertaking.   

One way of looking at this precession of simulacra is in the content of art, but I think another way of viewing this is through the form of art itself. Are memes art? They’re low effort, but they have a high amount of understanding and many times hint at a deeper feeling or idea that many people can relate with. Maybe they are. Ai imagery is similar. Low effort, but maybe lacking in significance or wider-connection. You can create memes with it that people will connect with, but creating a beautiful landscape is both hollow of meaning and hollow of effort. So what’s left to connect with?  

In the above example, the part people connect with about the bottom is the human effort… maybe they also connect with playing Minecraft, so people playing mine craft might be the people that connect with it the most. People can’t connect with that about the first. Ai generated pieces are a dime a dozen. It’s just a hollow picture void of significance either in terms of meaning or effort.  

And an additional concern stemming from this is in a world where people can’t tell the difference, maybe everything is dragged down to the “hollow of meaning, hollow of effort” level. If social media is flooded with ai generated content, most of it terrible, it kind of makes everything in that same space be assumed to be equally less valuable. It affects the context that all widespread media exists within.</div>

Joe too, acting all surprised at Trump's sending people to prison camps. You are SURPRISED that the monster who systematically seperated families to deport children away from their parents is treating people unfairly?

These dumb fucks only see what they want to see. Apologize all you want, if you as a grown man supported Trump in 2024 you are a fucking idiot and deserve all the flack you get. All the warning signs were there, they just choose to ignore that stuff as it didnt effect them personally.</div>

My dad planned to travel during retirement and passed away the year before getting to do so. I think he’d be very proud of me right now for doing this.

                                <div class="reply-body">Similar story here. Dad was brilliant but got bogged down in jobs and raising his family. Always supported my adventurelust. When I visited Greece, we nerded out over pictures of Delphi and Athens together when I got back. I proposed to my fiancée last fall in Italy (two years after he passed) and I could feel him with me there, and was proud too. Yours will be right there with you on that hike and is certainly proud of you.   Now you're making me wonder when my time will be to drop everything and travel for a couple of months. Safe and happy travels to you!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree with OP. I’m a hospice nurse practitioner and have watched numerous people take their last breaths 😞. None of them have ever said they wish they spent more time working or being productive. But what is commonly wished is that they spent more time with loved ones and doing the things that made them happy. Live life now 🙏🏽</div>

Yes what and how you are feeling during your last days is important but all the fucking years you have survive are even more important. Everyone will die with some or the other regret. Regrets are fuckin overrated and cannot be avoided.

Don't do stupid shit just because you don't want to feel certain way that last few minutes before you die. You have to chose if you would have 50 years of good life with 2 months of regret of "not enjoying" your life vs 50 years of shitty life and 2 months of regret of not doing much with your life and hitting your potential before you die. You will absolutely die with some unfulfilled emotion. Who gives a shit.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">100% supporting this. I felt this during the pandemic when I saw this high amount of cash sitting in my bank account. Those were the fruits of my labor from years of self-improvement and investing. I felt proud of that but almost immediately, i remember a couple of missed events like skipping on a dinner invite, not taking that vacation with friends, not trying that hobby, refusing that purchase that would have brought some memorable experiences... yes, I have my money and achievements but I can no longer bring back those moments that I allowed to pass.

Bottomline is, I dont wanna die rich in cash but poor in experiences. Since then, Ive been building time and priorities on the leisure side of things to help make productivity and experiences balanced.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">100% this. Every advancement in technology (new automation, e.g.) has been said to create more ease and quality of life, but instead it has only led to more production - and more capital.

Take an example of a company who makes 400 widgets every week. 

Say that company used to need 10 people to make the 400 widgets (one person works 40 hours and makes 40 widgets/week, 1 widget/hour). 

Machine automation has made it easier and the company now only needs 2 people to make the 400 (1 person can make 200 per 40 hours, 5 widgets/hour). 

Never does a business say, great, let's let those 2 people work half of the time to produce the 400 (20 hours/week to make 5 per hour). We are happy with the 400 widgets we make, and we are improving our employees' wellbeing, they can go do all the other things they want with their lives, hobbies, flourish, isn't this automation great for THEM.

No. Instead we say, now we will keep our 10 employees and they will still work at full hours, and our company can now make 2,000 widgets! (Or even more realistically, they will still cut 5 humans and still "improve output" by 2.5x, from 400 to 1000). 

It's just how our system is built. All the promises for improving people's lives and "rewiring our thinking" won't mean squat until the system as a whole is rebuilt, to deincentivize the endless need for business growth.</div>

I was laying in the hammock in my backyard listening to music looking at the stars and a single bright flash of white light almost like a camera flash popped in the sky. I’m thinking okay, that was cool, probably just a meteor coming towards me because there was absolutely no tail. About 15 seconds go by and the exact same flash in the exact same spot.

                        <div class="comment-body">I saw a flash exactly like you described just a few days ago while star gazing. It looked like it came from deep space and it was a singular flash (like a camera flash), perfectly circular, and felt like it was directed to my eye precisely. 

I continued to look at that spot for a while longer hoping to have another witness but there was no additional action. 

It felt very strange and very real, but i did not experience any additional sensations.  It definitely shook me and I’ve been thinking about it ever since so it is interesting to hear someone else describe a very similar experience. 

Thanks for sharing. </div>

About Christmas last year I was outside with my little cousin, deep in conversation and over his right shoulder, high in the sky, I saw a bright flash, perfectly circular like you say. And god damnit honestly I describe it to this day as if someone managed to line a flashlight directly with my pupil. I waited for 15 seconds while telling my cousin to watch that exact spot and bang it happens again. He absolutely freaks and his eyes instantly went red and started tearing up. He’s only 13 and doesn’t know anything about this stuff. He was freaking out. I was pretty shook too!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I saw activity in the night sky 11.30 pm UK time on 30th of March. It lasted for an hour and included these sort of incredible bright flare-ups, along with a lot of other strange and rapid manoeuvres that I cannot attribute to drones or meteors. It was all focused around a small cluster of stars. I never expected to see anything like this honestly. It was both exciting and somwhat disturbing to realise through personal experience there are things happening up there that we have no idea about.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Middle TN here.  I see these all the time.  Super bright flashes, like a camera.  They usually flash again in the same spot, but not always.  Some subsequent flashes are dimmer, but not always.  One day, I'll get a telescope w/imager on them.  The only explanation I've ever heard that's plausible is a defunct geostationary satellite tumbling and flashing/reflecting.  There is a database of these out there... tried to match location/times but nothing added up.  No clue what they are.</div>
