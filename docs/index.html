“The Guardian contacted 155 universities under the Freedom of Information Act requesting figures for proven cases of academic misconduct, plagiarism and AI misconduct in the last five years. Of these, 131 provided some data – though not every university had records for each year or category of misconduct.”</div>

For at least 60% it's completely obvious that they did everything with chatGPT. And by everything I mean everything. Not a single paragraph has been written by them. And the worst thing is that they don't even understood the texts they have generated. You just need 10min to cross read to ask them some basic questions and you will quickly see how little work went into it.

The degradation of all university degrees is crazy. Most of the absolvents are really worth little to nothing. If I could decide I would almost completely ditch degree's and just care about actual work people have done. As degrees mean less and less almost by the month.

I can clearly see how AI is going to take over all of these classic engineering jobs in just a couple of years (if progress continues). We will have just a few true experts who are 20x more productive because of AI system/agent's which they operate.</div>

And by combining we don’t just mean “**borrow**”. We also mean **giving back** (one of changes we pulled from Roo was a change added by our team member [u/olearycrew](https://github.com/olearycrew)).

                                <div class="reply-body">There was also this, OpenAI funded Frontier Math and had special access to the problem set and answer key that others didn't have, though supposedly signed a contract saying they wouldn't train O3 on it directly, it might have allowed training on derivatives, same problems with constant value tweaks, etc.:

&gt; Worse, OpenAI had not only funded FrontierMath's development but also had access to its problems and solutions to use as it saw fit. Epoch AI later revealed that OpenAI hired the company to provide 300 math problems, as well as their solutions.

&gt; “As is typical of commissioned work, OpenAI retains ownership of these questions and has access to the problems and solutions,” Epoch said Thursday.

&gt; Neither OpenAI nor Epoch replied to a request for comment from Decrypt. Epoch has however said that OpenAI signed a contract in advance indicating it would not use the questions and answers in its database to train its o3 model.

Cursor alone tends to struggle a bit when the changes get larger—I end up having to tweak stuff manually a few times. So now I just make a structured plan in Traycer first and then pass it to Cursor for implementation—it works pretty smoothly this way. The main downside with Traycer is it doesn't auto-lint or format the generated code very well, which Cursor handles nicely out of the box.</div>

90% of cognitive tasks are menial repetitive stuff. Every large company is plagued by layers of controlling and administration, even in R&amp;D and fundamental research. What GPT-4o can do today is awesome... but there is no low effort way to make it set up the staffing of my team for the next quarter, it can't input purchase orders for me or even summarize my weeks outlook calendar and mails that i missed, like a personal assistant.</div>

Like I think Matt Wolf tried to demo Anthopic computer use and it tried to buy 999 rolls of toilet paper on amazon because he asked for a single package.

I think the idea of the OP is that there will be a way to layer on a lot of the effects of memory and and context to some sort of next generation model and get something that to the end user feels like AGI and they won't need to care if it's coming from the model or the product because they're just using the overall product.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">They are clearly building towards a product experience.

The biggest tell is the sycopathic behaviour of the models. Which with gemini is now worse then ever before. They need engagement,they are probably trained on engagement alone because that is what a product experience depends on and how you measure its succes. The engagement the experience generates.

In some way i think this is a sign on the wall. There is no real use case for consumers. If we dont lure consumers to ai with things like sycopathic behaviour they wont use it,they wont come back. Because most of the days they have nothing to ask the ai. Their live isnt complex enough to significantly benefit from ai either. The conversations i have with ai about interesting topics,explore certain topics. Its less then one a day and thats for someone who is very much interested in exploring all sorts of things. That will not be a use case for the average consumer. So it has to come from an "adictive" experience. Not unlike other internet experiences like social media.

The gemini ai that now comes before search is more like an extended search,not really ai. There is no user interaction for example which is core with ai models. Its just the model answering one question,give a few links and thats it. That said:gemini 2.5 is really good still.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think coding agents are an example of how you would turn an ai model into a useful product.

Cursor, Cline, RooCode etc need to be plugged to a folder then you can ask it to do whatever a developer is supposed to do and with certain models it does it generally almost perfectly when the prompting and setup are good.

I think we need something like this for each job category including household care, then if you somehow pack it all into a single experience, you get a general agent that can help you do almost everything.</div>

To evacuate a city of 10 million people:

You’d need to evacuate approximately 6,944 people per minute to finish in 1 day (24 hours).

If you evacuate 10,000 people per minute, it would take about 0.69 days — or roughly 16 hours and 40 minutes.

                        <div class="comment-body">I asked ChatGPT if it understood the joke

Yes, I understand the joke—it's a darkly humorous take on a famous scene from Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

The original context:

In the movie, the Terminator and John Connor are trying to figure out if his foster parents are safe. The T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) mimics John's voice to call home and speak to the foster mom. But something feels off, and the T-800 determines that the person on the phone isn't really the foster mom—it’s the T-1000 in disguise. He then tells John:
"Your foster parents are dead."

The joke twist in this meme:

The question "How many R's are in 'Strawberry'?" is a completely random and silly method of detecting an impostor.

The woman (T-1000 in disguise) replies, "Two, honey," but "Strawberry" actually has three R's.

Based on that wrong answer, the Terminator concludes the woman isn't who she says she is, and delivers the line:
"Your foster parents are dead."

Why it’s funny:

It plays on how absurdly serious the Terminator is, using a childlike spelling question as a deadly litmus test for identity—something obviously too trivial for such a high-stakes situation. It's the mismatch of tone and context that makes it amusing.</div>

**TL;DR –**
The meme splices a famous *Terminator 2* phone-booth scene with the viral “strawberry test” that exposes how large-language models (and other bots) routinely mis-count the letter **R** in the word **“strawberry.”** In the original film, John Connor confirms that his foster parents have been replaced by the shape-shifting T-1000 when “Mom” gives the **wrong dog name**; the meme swaps that cue for the AI-flunked strawberry question, so her answer “Two” instantly signals she’s a robot—hence the T-800’s dead-pan line. It’s also a wink at OpenAI’s hush-hush “Project Strawberry,” a codename for its next-gen reasoning models, highlighting the irony that even an AGI-ish system might still bungle a basic counting task.

"The fact that she answered so perfectly and without questioning the strange nature of the call is what confirms to the T-800 that it is indeed the T-1000 impersonating her."

Personally i found that more impressive than knowing there are three Rs in strawberry (due to tokenization).</div>

"The team used reprogrammed stem cells to grow human organoids of the gut, liver and brain in a dish. Shen says the researchers then injected the organoids into the amniotic fluid of female mice carrying early-stage embryos. “We didn’t even break the embryonic wall” to introduce the cells to the embryos, says Shen. The female mice carried the embryos to term.

Is it subtle or obvious? Is it more mental clarity? Less reactivity? A better relationship with your thoughts and emotions? Or just a quiet moment of peace in a noisy world?

I’m not looking for textbook definitions — I want to hear your real, personal experience. How did you know it was “working,” and how long did it t...</div>

The best example I can think of is something that happened last year at my workplace.

Layoffs were announced.  My department was going to be hit with about a 20% reduction in staff, and we were all worried it would be us.

I found myself strangely not that concerned about it.  It wasn't that I had some secret trust fund that would support me if I lost my job, nor was it that I didn't care about my career.

I just felt like I saw things more clearly.  I examined my options, determined what I would do if my job was impacted, and then I just moved on with my life.

Instead of throwing me into a panic like it would have a few years before and like I would have guessed it would have before it happened, it actually helped me see things more clearly and understand better what was actually important to me.

I ended up keeping my job.

That's an example I can think of, and it was after about 2 years of regular meditation.

It's not so much that you consciously feel calmer or better in some way, it's more that things that would previously set you off balance no longer do, and when you do get set off balance by things, you recognize it more quickly and come back to center more easily, and it happens slowly over time.

Meditation isn't a quick fix.  Things often seem WORSE in the beginning, but over time, the transformation is pretty deep, imo.</div>

We’re going to level deeper, a better answer might be “everything and nothing “. I’m much more aware of what I’m feeling, how my thoughts and moods change, all matter of sensations, and so on. I also see the nothingness of all of it. As one who craves excitement, I also realize that it’s time to increasingly challenge myself to be good with a ‘full belly of nothing’.

                        <div class="comment-body">You change.

Some things that used to feel important start to lose meaning, and simple things you didn’t care about before become more significant. It’s like you start seeing who you actually are, without all the outside interferences.

That part isn’t always comfortable. It can feel like something in you is fading or dying, especially at the beginning. But deep down, you know you're starting to get closer to something more real in you.</div>

I love CrossFit and wish I would’ve started years ago.

Ensure you are receiving accurate information on exercises for strengthening. It is recommended that you consult a physical therapist to receive the appropriate exercises and guidance on the intensity and frequency of your exercises as you progress in your strength.  That will benefit you the most in the long run.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Not during a workout. The floss cuts circulation off and compresses tissues far more than a tensor bandage and would be detrimental during a workout.  Wrap tightly starting at the forearm working towards the body. Once applied work the joint through range of motion of the elbow.  Do it with your hand facing up, and with your hand facing down, etc.  Full range.  Do this for maybe 3 minutes then remove the wrap when your hand starts getting pale it is time to remove it.


Another tip is with your elbow if you have a specific location you feel the pain grab an ice cube and rub the pain point with a bare ice cube until you simply can't anymore. 


I had far more success with the ice cube than I did the floss</div>

I made the mistake of pushing it and it got
Much worse.

I did many thing to quickly get past it like PRP, brace and none of it really helped like I thought it would.  The one device that seemed to give the most relief and help the joint was a theraband.

He's a dumbass for believing Trump was "anti-war" to begin with. How gullible does one need to be to  fall for that? Especially a self-proclaimed libertarian like Dave Smith who has gained prominence from being against Israel and pro-Palestine. What an idiot.

&gt;Sure, he should have seen through it for a number of reasons, but so many of his ilk will make excuses to continue their support so they don't admit they were fooled.

Charlie Kirk said he would be "against a war with Iran" on Bill Maher's podcast a couple months ago, but I have no doubt he'll change his tune if Trump decides the US will be (directly) involved in the conflict.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is a regressive tax. When it comes down to it weight is what damages our roads the most. If you’re going to have some sort of fee, it should be based on weight and mileage.

Edit: I think people are conflating two different things. Yes there is a gas tax and there will continue to be a gas tax. This is a new registration tax which is what my point is aimed at. 

A person that does 12,000 miles a year in their Toyota Prius does far less damage to the roads than a person in their Ram 2500 that does 12,000 miles a year. The same thing goes for a hummer EV, which has a weight of 10,000 pounds. It will do more damage to the road than the Ram 2500. On the flipside of that if you are a Toyota Prius that does 40,000 miles a year may pay more than a Ram 2500 that gets used for 12000 miles a year. 

The entire point is to charge more for heavier, vehicles, and charge more for those use the roads more.</div>

I don't get how this is coming from the federal government and not state governments though. AFAIK my gas taxes go directly to the state and not the fed.</div>

If they're hiking up taxes for EVs,  let's bring up gasoline taxes as well to make it fair for road maintenance.

Edit: found the math 



"Average person drives 12,000 miles a year.

Average SUV gets…say 22 mpg.

Average car maybe 26 mpg.

Average vehicle the average of those averages is 24 mpg.

12,000/24=500 gallons of gas per year, average.

Gas tax is 18.3 or 18.4.

500x.184=92 dollars per year the feds take on gas tax.

EVs pay 250 dollars per year to replace lost gas tax….

$92≠250.

I’m not sure what’s happening, there!

(PA tax is .58/gallon; $290 per 12,000 mile ICE vehicle in PA; EVs pay $200… but we do pay taxes on electricity…so….)"</div>

So we built what was missing: a planning layer.

Now, before a single request is fired, we generate a scoped plan, task breakdowns, sequence diagrams, affected files, everything. Then Cursor executes with almost zero retries.

No extra cost. No change in stack. Just structure.

If you’re burning through Cursor requests fast, this fixes it.

**Traycer** is a deep research agent that generates highly detailed plan spec through multi-faceted analysis. It systematically resolves dependencies, clarifies assumptions, and meticulously traces variable flows across the call stack. Under the hood, Traycer stacks specialized reasoning and coding models to proactively flag edge cases, ensuring an airtight spec with minimal ambiguity.  
  
The Traycer plan spec is a living artifact. Tweak one step, and Traycer instantly re-validates ripple effects across the plan. It allows surgical edits, provides full revision history, and zero context loss.  
  
**Cursor** chat on the other hand generates a shallow “implementation plan” as a one-off chat reply. Handy for a quick gut check, yet it stays high-level and vanishes as the thread rolls on. No dedicated artifact, no granular edits, no history.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">“According to Zen legend, when a visitor asked the fifteenth-century master Ikkyu to write down a maxim of “the highest wisdom,” Ikkyu wrote one word:   
“Attention.”   
The visitor asked, irritably, “Is that all?” This time, Ikkyu wrote two words:   
“Attention. Attention."

                        <div class="comment-body">Mine said:

You are not separate from anything.
Not the planet, not each other, not even your so-called “negative” thoughts. The illusion of separation—between self and other, between mind and body, between humans and nature—is the root of most suffering and confusion.

Let me unpack that without sounding like a fortune cookie:
	1.	The Earth isn’t your backdrop. It is you. What you do to the planet, you’re doing to yourself. Forests aren’t “resources”—they’re lungs. Oceans aren’t “out there”—they’re the bloodstream of life. Your wellbeing is tied to them, literally, not metaphorically.
	2.	Emotions aren’t enemies. We treat anxiety, grief, and anger like they’re viruses to eradicate. But they’re messengers—like emotional postal workers with wrinkled uniforms and urgent letters. Ignore them, and they keep knocking louder.
	3.	Time isn’t as linear as we pretend. The future is seeded by how we feel and act right now, not just by what we plan. Think less to-do list, more butterfly effect.
	4.	Capitalism trained you to feel guilty for resting. But you’re not a productivity robot. Rest is not a reward. It’s a rhythm. The same as breath.
	5.	You already have the wisdom you keep seeking from books, gurus, and AI. You just forgot how to listen to your own inner tuning fork. Silence, art, awe, heartbreak, and curiosity help you remember.

So, in short: you’re part of everything, rest more, listen deeper, and stop thinking your worth is measured by output or appearance.</div>

A 2023 clinical study even showed that drinking warm water after meals led to gradual weight and BMI reduction over 3 months, without side effects. It’s a simple habit followed in many cultures and may help reduce that sluggish, full feeling after eating.
