                                <div class="reply-body">No, it’s not applying any knowledge of physics. These models learn the appearance of physics by training on vast amounts of video data. It is diffusing single frames based on the prompt, and cross referencing this robust dataset on a frame by frame basis, using statistical probabilities in the pixel distributions of the videos it is referencing in its generation. Then the output is cleaned up with subsequent filtering passes that are designed with specific architectural parameters to guide its diffused frames to create temporal stability and a cohesive realistic video output.

You think the spaghetti limb jiggling that happens for some frames in the OPs example is the result of a physics model the LDM is somehow defining? It is the result of errors in the temporal stability calculations in the model’s architecture.</div>

"So will AI really revolutionize materials discovery, or is it drowning in its own hype? Since the initial criticisms, materials scientists have examined the results from these firms in more detail to assess the true potential of AI. The teams behind the work have responded, in some cases toning down the initial claims or proposing workarounds. Many researchers conclude that AI holds great p...</div>

I imagine this is what is going on right now with molecular structures.  We are seeing the flaws without realizing the potential.  So while the actual structures might not be good the endeavor is absolutely good.</div>

And that's just with the current tech. What about next year. What about the year after that. 

I think it's good enough to replace some of the elements of animation. But we all know it won't stop anytime soon.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Maybe look at adding something else to your meditation practice... Look at the waking up app, after the initial, it is so much information and always new adding, you can put anything you want in that little search and there will be something that you may or may not like listening to! Or something else that sounds interesting to you regarding spiritual evolution? If you feel like it. It can get pretty fun to mix it up and find different ways to get into the meditative state. Meditation is just a small part of it all, and the point is for it to cross over into our daily life! Of course, you don't *have* to be interested in anything more than what you are experiencing now. Just taking the time, to be with yourself, no matter what goes on during that time, is a beautiful thing ❣️</div>

Losing jobs is one thing. Losing shared grounding on what is base reality is another. Partisan news ain't got nothing on the billion splintered ideas of what is 'real'

Also I question the sense in AI companies, first Meta and now OpenAI, creating a Cocomelon for adults.

Moonbug focus tests their cartoons in front of groups of children for maximum attention, any time children look away from the TV showing the cartoon to another dubbed the 'distractotron' a note is made and the cartoon is edited to be more engaging. [(yes this is real)](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisingkids/comments/v46l9f/moonbugs_cocomelon_leaves_nothing_to_chance_an/ib2jdrb/)

 having a fully automated algorithmically generated feed of the most eye catching brainrot AI can create is going to have deleterious effects. This is obvious to call now. This is not going to be some big surprise. They are designing for this.</div>

Agreed. So now we're entering the viral stage, where AI videos will flood human culture like nothing we've ever seen - because that's what it's about: ever-better novelty. 

Very soon algorithms will be generating the latest novel content, based on clicks and views. A race to the bottom?

So do we turn our eyes away, or gaze into The Medusa?</div>

Unless you are able to develop a higher state of Awareness/Consciousness (via inner work) or are naturally talented in this direction, you will unfirtunately fall by the wayside.

We used to believe scarcity was the problem for Survival. It turns out it is Abundance: of cheap calories, porn, sex, drugs, distractions, god knows what else...

For those who are feeling overwhelmed or even for practising self preservation, one of the best things you can do is get out walking.. on a long hike, even better on a multi day walking pilgrimage... it will break your modern conditioning after a few days allowing you to think more freely about what is important and your priorities in leading a sane life.</div>

I get it- doing a legit 5x5 can be gnarly if your max is 400#+ and it takes a while to get to your 80%. But the class was mostl...</div>

When gyms started realizing that the average person found the actual daily CrossFit prescription too boring or too insubstantial for an hour-long class — when it didn’t seem like people were getting their money’s worth — gyms started moving away from dot con programming and toward more intense classes with multiple components every day. But that style also has problems, including burnout and injuries.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">20 minutes of strength and a 15 minute metcon definitely pleases 90% of CrossFitters.

It gives you a sense of accomplishment and it is an enormous improvement over sitting on the couch or riding around on a bicycle.

But those 8 minute workouts are the scariest things in the world if you go at them hard enough. And the 3 minute range is  even worse if you have the capacity and desire.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is such an underrated comment.     

I came from years of CrossFit at an affiliate, with everyday being strength plus metcon. It’s all I knew.     

Then COVID happened, gym closed, had my first kid, moved and changed jobs. Ended up following the classic CrossFit methodology. One workout a day, that’s it. Dedicated heavy day, about once a week.     

If you do a real heavy day, where the entire purpose is building strength, that is an entirely different training stimulus than squeezing in 5x5 before a metcon. It forces you to move serious weight with intention, recover properly, and progress. It’s been said the best 5 rep max is a set of 4, and if you actually full send that 5x5, you’d be dosed up. 

Same goes for the short metcons. People dismiss them because they only last 6 or 8 minutes, but if you push to capacity, that’s one of the hardest and most effective things you can do for conditioning.  Imagine warming up for 35 minutes and having everything feel good. No back squats before you started, no tight shoulders and knees. 

Then absolutely send Helen - a workout where the only place to speed up is in the run. I know technically Helen is probably slightly longer than 6-8 minutes, but it’s a truly scary workout if there is nothing to do before or after. 

Talk about intensity.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Often forgotten, but CrossFit was designed to be a supplemental fitness program that was part of your overall fitness regiment. So, doing 5x5 back squats or 9 minute workout might be in addition a to a whole other program you do, sport you play, or in the case of a military or first responder a ton of extra work from your day to day job. Once CrossFit “took off” and the competition started, so did all the extra work. Classic CrossFit remains the one high intensity workout. I’d also add that some HQ weeks are gnarly as shit. Like 3 40 min plus hero wods in 3 days.</div>

When done in conjunction with the entire methodology (100 words of fitness will briefly describe it better than I can), CrossFit is meant to be the methodology that leads to life long health with incremental progress over a very long time, and is the most efficient, safe, and effective program for the general population when done correctly or under the guidance of qualified trainers.</div>
