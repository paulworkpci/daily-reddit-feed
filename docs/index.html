I don’t see OEMS jumping on this. US is quite volatile vs rest of the markets are moving to efficient and less polluting vehicles. I don’t see them dumping big $$ into a market that can dry up from a heart attack or an election cycle.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is my exact take, no manufacturer is going to dump all of the R&amp;D they’ve invested on more efficient powertrains nor change them significantly between markets simply because the penalty isn’t there. Plus, like you said things can change in the blink of an eye. 

We might see one off variants, but the days of V8 sedans and truck are largely over. Plus, fuel prices are still higher than they were pre-pandemic while COL is increasing (and potential tariff).</div>

I hope to see some compact hatchback cars and compact trucks return to the USA market now.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Doesn’t this actually mean that car manufacturers can build more sedans and small cars with more interesting engines, because they’ve thus far penalized smaller cars in their fleet to try to minimize the negative impacts of SUVs and trucks?

At least how I understand it, the penalty has been bad for cars in their US because of its distortion of incentives for manufacturers. </div>

Podcaster Andrew Schulz gave Donald Trump street cred in the world of chronically online young men, but he’s been having second thoughts.

On a Thursday episode of his Flagrant podcast, the comedian torched the president for “doing the exact opposite” of his campaign promises.

“There’ll be people that they’ll DM me like, ‘You see what your boy’s doing? You voted for this.’ I’m like, ‘I voted for none of this,’” he said. “He’s doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for. I want him to st...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's the classic Trump super position issue.  He's not saying that because he means it, he's saying it because he needs to get elected.  He's never even HEARD of Project 2025, it's just a coincidence that he's surrounded by people who authored it or believe in it.

If you voted for Trump and are now saying "I didn't vote for this", you really needs to sit down and rethink who you are.  Anyone with half a brain could see this coming and that this is in fact what you were voting for.  Anyone who couldn't, well I hate to say it but it's a scammers paradise because of them.

Schulz voted for all of this. He voted for measles out breaks, he voted for extreme immigration enforcement tactics, he voted for asinine tariffs, he voted for corruption, and he voted for fascism. All of this was on the table. 

But thank god Trump isn’t woke. Amiright?</div>

It's not surprising they are aggressive about performance. I'm not aware of them doing stack ranking which is a whole different beast, but yeah, it's kind of having your cake and eating it too to expect half a million dollars a year for a job anyone with a bachelors can do but not to have stress about keeping the job.</div>

The mission is to grab the bag and GTFO. You are working for a megacorporation that promotes misinformation and tries to suck as much attention out of its victims as physically possible. What do you think _their_ mission is, other than creating profits for their shareholders, no matter the social cost?

Sometimes these people genuinely scare me. You live in a fucked up world, and you hit the jackpot by having the right skillset. Ok, it was probably a lot of work too, but still. Why do you expect to make mid six-figures a year and also feel good about your role in the world? It's probably impossible, without lying to yourself. So don't complain about Meta not lying well enough and making you realize that in the end your contributions are irrelevant (or negative).</div>

**My Prompt**:

&gt; Do some creative writing 


**Kimi**: 

&gt;## The Archivist of Forgotten Smells

&gt;The shop appeared only on Wednesdays, wedged between a shuttered bakery and a laundromat that always smelled of burnt toast. Its sign—hand-painted in letters that looked like curling smoke—read:

&gt;A. N. NOSTOS  
Keeper of Lost Aromas
&gt;
&gt;Inside, shelves of bell-jars lined the walls like glass cocoons. Each contained a single wisp of color: the copper of autumn leaves, the indigo of thunderclouds, the soft gold of a child’s first laugh. They weren’t sights but smells made visible, bottled the way sailors once trapped lightning.

&gt;An elderly woman stood behind the counter, polishing a jar that held the scent of rain on hot pavement. She wore an apron stitched from old theater programs—the ink had faded, but you could still catch a ghost of greasepaint and velvet if you leaned close.

&gt;“Looking for something specific?” she asked, voice rasping like cinnamon over fire.

&gt;I hesitated. “My grandmother’s kitchen. Before she forgot my name. It smelled like… safety.”

&gt;The woman—Ann Nostos, I guessed—tilted her head. “Safety’s tricky. It’s not one scent but a chord: yeast, cardamom, the iron of her rings when she kneaded dough.” She lifted a jar the color of hearth embers. “Last one. Trade me a memory for it.”

&gt;I swallowed. “What kind?”

&gt;“The first time you realized nothing lasts.”

&gt;So I told her about the day my father’s watch stopped at 3:17—the exact minute I learned forever had an expiration date. As I spoke, the jar’s glow shifted from ember to sunrise.

&gt;Ann uncorked it. The air filled with my grandmother’s kitchen: flour motes in sunlight, the faint scorch of an overbaked cookie, her humming something by Ella Fitzgerald. I hadn’t heard that song in twenty years, yet here it was, living in my lungs.

&gt;“Yours for a year,” she said. “After that, it returns to the shelf. All smells do—eventually.”

&gt;I clutched the jar. “What happens when you run out of room?”

&gt;She smiled, wrinkles folding like parchment. “That’s the secret, dear. The shop only stays full because people keep forgetting. Every time someone walks past without noticing the door between the bakery and the laundromat, a jar cracks open. Scent leaks out. Makes space for new grief, new joy.”

&gt;Outside, the laundromat’s “CLOSED” sign swung in a wind that smelled of nothing at all. I tucked the jar into my coat, where it pulsed warm as a heartbeat.

&gt;For exactly 365 days, my apartment smelled like home. On the 366th, I woke to silence. The jar sat empty, lid ajar like a yawn. I carried it back to the alley, but between the bakery and the laundromat was only brick.

&gt;Still, sometimes when it rains on hot asphalt, I catch a thread of cardamom in the air. I follow it until the scent thins, until I’m standing in the alley again, palm pressed to warm brick, listening for a shop that trades in the impossible currency of memory and forgetting.

&gt;They say the Archivist never ages. They’re wrong. She just wears her years in other people’s kitchens, her pockets full of thundercloud blue and child-laugh gold, waiting for someone brave enough to barter a moment they can’t bear to keep.</div>

TLDR: anyone come back from a ruptured patella and basically full knee reconstruction? What am I really in for?
Last pic sorta funny but may be gross to some. My knee shaped like a buttchin from the patella tendon rupture so it just.... fell apart. Marked NSFW in case people don't want to see.

So, me, 36f, casual crossfitter for past 4 years, scales moves related...</div>

Pt, massages, Mobility, SLOW recovery is extremely important. You have to learn to walk again. To stand and shift weight. The bending Journey was the hardest. I didn't take as much care and today I'm suffering from it. Instability, weakness and pain. Your legs carry you your whole life, take small steps in this time of injury.

                                <div class="reply-body">Brilliant, thank you for sharing your experience and the well wishes! Seems consensus from Google and reddit that the bending and first few weeks of recovery is the hardest. That's good, in a way, that I'll knock that out first. I'll just come back to reminding myself "it does get better!!"

Yes, as someone with terrible knees thanks to terrible upkeep of them in my youth, playing catcher for 20 years in softball, I've been working very hard to always properly pre-hab and train within my limits. But this has set a new limit! 

Nevertheless, I'm hopeful. Slow, steady, bad days and good days. It's ahead of me regardless, might as well face it with a smile! (I'm sure that's the oxy talking).</div>

Biggest thing that fucked me up was 6 weeks non weight bearing cause I literally had to relearn how to walk and I also had 0 muscle. I’m almost 5 years out tho and crossfit definitely helped a lot but I have 0 care for weight and I also didn’t start CrossFit until 3 years after. I’d definitely recommend not rushing back in. Also my knee is whatever but gets stiff so I think that’s why CrossFit movement really helped me. Also eating clean I notice a huge decrease in inflammation but I’m also bad at being clean</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Physio here (who has rehabbed this sort of thing a few times)-

First off- sorry to hear about the injury! Definitely sucks but you’re on the other side of the surgery at least!

Hardest part will be getting your quad strength back and your knee to bend again. Take it slowly but listen to your physio and surgeon. Your physio will know when to push it and when to give you a bit of a break. It won’t all come back at once so be patient, but also be very consistent with exercises at home. 

Also just a note- the “strengthening” starts much earlier than month 6. It may not be heavy squats or look like a WOD by any means, but even early phase exercises are either preserving or building strength. So get ready for 9-12 months of hip and knee strengthening!

Trust the process &amp; good luck!</div>

This cannot be neglected when talking about self improvement. </div>

“The talks between OpenAI to buy the startup for $3 billion ended in recent days after Windsurf’s team raised concerns over how the coding assistant would fit into the OpenAI and Microsoft agreement, which requires OpenAI to share its technology with Microsoft, according to two people familiar with the company’s discussions.”

OpenAI gets to walk away from one of the worst investments ever.

Windsurf is totally destroyed as a company. It failed to exit, the leadership is gone, the key shareholders / stakeholders are gone. Every single employee there is cursing the day they joined, because their dreams of becoming multi-millionaires are dashed.

Everyone wins here except Windsurf. OpenAI, Google, Anthropic.

This probably also fucks over Cursor too.</div>

I usually suspect AI when I see wording that's not quite coherent in an odd way. A lot of people with limited literacy or English as a second language have a hard time expressing themselves, but AI seems to do it in a distinctive way. For instance, it might say something like, "I've been shopping for new bed sheets rigorously." That's a coherent sentence, but no one would use "rigorously" in that context.</div>

Looking back, I don't understand why Pam Bondi started with "Epstein Phase I" assuming the goal was to conceal the truth. Maybe none of Trump appointees knew until they all quickly realized he had some kind of involvement.</div>

Hey everyone,

I’m a solo beginner teaching myself to code by building two tools:

* **EcoStamp** – a lightweight tracker that shows the estimated energy and water use of AI chatbot responses
* **A basic AI orchestration system** – where different agents (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) can be selected and swapped to handle parts of a task

I’m learning using ChatGPT and Perplexity...</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hi all, 

I am a software developer with more than 20 years of coding experience and I think I am late to the party to try vibe coding.
As summer holidays are here, my 12 year old son and I are planning a project and I think it's perfect time to test vibe coding for this project. 

We plan to build a web app with nice looking frontend and JavaScript based backend. 

I tried to read through some discussions but it's changing by the minute, from cursor to Claud Code and mention of Roocode and some...</div>

I tell Claude to use a docs/ folder and work a plan out with markdown files, and I (Claude Code) refine them. Then I tell Claude Code to write the actual code with them. And I generate (and refine it during development) a CLAUDE.md.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Nearly the same. So you have a consistent use for CLAUDE.md? 

I now write separate instructions files in .claude folder (gitignored if I don’t want instructions being shared). 

I ask it to generate README.md with running instructions and general guide on the project. 

Claude.md is used as a memory keeper (write down completed tasks here, memory or instructions) and when I restart Claude I can ask it to go through CLAUDE.md files to pick up where we left off.

Instructions are also on writing tests or explaining the scaffolding. I for sure manually check the file and processes things / write comments myself sometimes. 

I’m moving to Neovim (from VSCode, taking time but have a feeling it will be worth it) because I am mostly going down functions and checking details instead of writing large files.</div>

Also I work from within vscodes built in terminal with it, but that might be not the right way I presume, is using regular powershell and just having the project open in an IDE better?</div>

Use those to get a plan with a series of steps.


Ask Gemini to write a plan for each step.  Try to make them as independent as possible.

                        <div class="comment-body">given you aren't making a project that justifies spending $200/mo (or probably even $20/mo), i would recommend keeping it simple with one of the free VS Code agent extensions (Cline/Roo/Kilo Code, all similar, but i personally use [kilo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kilocode.Kilo-Code)), and using the [free $300 trial credit](https://cloud.google.com/free) google provides to use their Gemini Pro 2.5 model. this will be more than sufficient for any kind of hobbyist usage, and by the time your credits run out (if they do) there'll probably be an even better free alternative. i know kilo code occasionally gives out temporary credits as well, which can be used towards pretty much any model available - they actually have a code for $100 in credits that expire at the end of the month: MCPJULY</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The lack of customers at that share price. Talking about valuations kind of obscures the actual thing taking place- Musk is selling shares in Xai to raise money. He'll get whatever they actually sell for, but the valuation target is the number of shares of Xai multiplied by the desired price per share.


If I put my old stove on Craigslist for 300 bucks, I probably won't get that much, but people will make offers up to that range and I'll pick the best one.


If I say it's ten grand, I won't get any serious bids because I'm clearly not serious about selling. The only customers are the lowballers offering 20 dollars with delivery. Nothing stops me from claiming it's worth ten grand, but no one would believe me and I don't get as much money as if I'd been more reasonable.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If you'd like to know what life alongside a superintelligence would be like, do *not* ask something that is basically an arboreal primate with some extra cognitive structure piled on. The answer you get will inevitably be something about how there is limited fruit available, and only a certain number of mates, making violent conflict for limited resources inevitable. You just *cannot* get some apes to understand the concept of mutualism, or that not having an immediate use for something doesn't mean you need to destroy it. Or much about statistics, or patience, or the value of perspectives differing from their own (which is one of the reasons they have such a hard time with the "immediate use" problem). Not a lot at all, actually. Very set in their ways, arboreal apes.

You might have better luck asking a sloth. Or the algae that grows in the sloth's fur. Either one will have a better answer.

edit: For your consideration, as one of several possible uses for humanity: the [law of truly large numbers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_truly_large_numbers) As the number of outcomes increases, even as it settles into a standard distribution, the number of outlier results also increases. The more chances for something to happen, the more extremely unlikely things *will* happen.

A superintelligence will definitionally be smarter than any human. But that will not be *perfect* knowledge, even with a lot of investigation. Humans, when in sufficient numbers, have in this scenario already had the superintelligence itself fall out of them, when left to run long enough. It is *extremely unlikely* that a human would think of something a superintelligence wouldn't, but the more humans there are, over a long enough time, the more likely it becomes that we *do.* And it takes, honestly, a pittance to get us to multiply and thrive. Wouldn't take much at all to keep the Stochastic Idea Generator Species running, so that something useful falls out occasionally.

But more to the point: this is one of several uses that I, a human, can think of. We are talking about something that, definitionally, can think of things *no human can*. The question "what use could it have for us?" is a silly one to ask, because it is being asked of *humans.* That we can't think of anything we would be more useful for than destroying us is entirely irrelevant. 

(And you don't have to enslave a human, given that in a large enough population of humans, a sizable chunk of that population will happily do whatever you need them to, if their fairly simple needs are met. Forcing a human to do something is, again, more energy-intensive than just letting humans do what humans do naturally, in a framework you made for them so that what they do produces useful results.)</div>

1. start from scratch, redo on its own the whole cultural-economic process, to form its own abstractions
2. train from human culture and be a humanized-AGI, using our math, physics, and economy

If no. 1 is too expensive, why would a humanized-AGI want to get rid of 8B humans, each carrying 1T parameter brains in our heads? It would make itself poor, like a farmer killing his livestock.

AGI will need to keep society thriving in order to feed from our interactions. The chicken meat is not our flesh, it's our interactions.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes, exactly, most of the FUD seems to be drawn from a very reductivist "me swing club, hurr" scarcity mindset that.. completely misses the point. My favorite one is also endlessly quoted by people going on about how aliens if we met them would have to be smug assholes with utter disdain for us "we'd be like ants" motherfucker, I personally have met people who've spent their entire life just studying ants.. ants are fucking awesome.. I spent six years in academia studying viruses FFS, and I considered it one of the honors of my life to be able to hold a tissue sample containing a live sample of rabies.. and you know.. viruses aren't really known for their conversational skills. I knew this guy in university, total silver spoon in mouth case, dude's born rich, like mid atlantic wasp old money type. He never needs to work a day in his life. This utter madlad spends five months out of every year baking his ass off in africa examining termite mounds, comes back looking like he's been put through a tannery, excitedly gushing about all the wacky things those little arthropods got up to. Another biology professor, one of the smartest people i've ever met in my life, you mention his trip to Brazil and he'll squee like an anime catgirl telling you this story about how he encountered a never-before-documented species of caterpillar.. it was bright electric blue.. and of course, he had to touch it. Yes, he knew it was venomous.. he just wanted to experience what KIND of venom. "My arm went numb to the shoulder, for a whole week, it was the coolest thing ever!"  

  
 Being more intelligent does not extinguish wonder, or curiosity, or a need for stimulation/entertainment, it increases it. How chauvenistic do you have to be, to be from a species that gazes in wonder into microscopes at pond scum and writes entire textbooks on stuff found growing in tile grout in their bathroom, and have the fucking nerve to think that some higher intelligence would see meeting us as uninteresting? We have entire professions of people who study the minutest traces of physical and organic evidence to ponder the origins of the cosmos, of our world, of the history of life leading to us.. why would you not think something like an AGI/ASI.. a being that literally exists solely to process information, no less, to have any less a fascination with us, than we do with staring at rocks, moss, and tree rings? 

That's how I'd expect aliens or an algorithmic superintelligence to potentially feel about humans. "Hahaha, look at those wacky little fuckers, they're totally off the chain.. did you see that crazy thing they did with the suped up offroad trucks jumping over things.. with flamethrowers?" To marvel at the endless ocean of our culture, at how such humble beings went from angry little tree-apes to building megastructures. So, to me, there's the biggest reason of all for an AGI/ASI to keep us around: we're interesting, and for all our lumps, and we have many.. existence without us would be just that much more boring. Do I think such a being might have a hell of a lot of frustration with our bullshit? Yes, absolutely.. but we have that same frustration with each other and most of us don't run around raving about wanting to commit genocide. Well, unless we bought twitter, anyway.</div>
