                        <div class="comment-body">The parallels to pre-WWII in the last decade are uncanny. 

All the potential kickstarters to WWIII are either literally happening right now (Israel + Iran), have already happened (Russia + Ukraine/Europe) or are about to happen (China + Taiwan). Not to mention all the other tensions and atrocities happening around the world at the same time (Kashmir, Myanmar, El Salvador, Congo, South Africa, North Korea, Syria, etc).

Mix this with the weak current state of most western countries (borderline Civil War in the US, subversion of democratic norms all over Europe, Canada and the US, rising political violence, unprecedented inequality, collapsing infrastructures, etc) and the suddenly rapid development and implementation of AI...

I'd say we are well into WWIII already and we just won't call it that until long after it's ended. Buckle up. This isn't a theory anymore.</div>

There's a built-in code editor.

Huang interpreted Amodei’s recent comments as isolative and protectionist; that the Anthropic ceo is claiming only Anthropic should be working on ai. Anthropic disputes this interpretation. 

Huang also dismisses the depth and volume of job losses that amodei is claiming. Note that he didn’t dispute that ai would cause job losses, he’s just quibbling with the actual number.</div>

He's never once advocated that nobody else build AI. And all he's ever done is advocate for collaboration from public, private, and governing bodies to discuss openly how AI will change society.

Other than hyping up an unrealistic rate of progress, the only thing you can argue Amodei *might* be doing is secretly pushing for regulatory capture. But I don't even think that argument holds much water.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Amodei did however, when Deepseek R1 was announced, say a lot of nationalistic things about how it was very important that it was a US company that was leading, and that the US should limit exports of critical things to other countries in an attempt to slow others down.

Reading the blog post now feels almost comical, and also scary because it doesn't seem like Amodei had changed his mind.


&gt;Given my focus on export controls and US national security, I want to be clear on one thing. I don't see DeepSeek themselves as adversaries and the point isn't to target them in particular. In interviews they've done, they seem like smart, curious researchers who just want to make useful technology. 
But they're beholden to an authoritarian government that has committed human rights violations, has behaved aggressively on the world stage, and will be far more unfettered in these actions if they're able to match the US in AI.

I can think of another country that has arguably committed human rights violations, acted aggressively on the world stage and will be far more unfettered in their actions if they get access to AGI/ASI, and it's the same country he is very much rooting for.

A lot of the things he says are very much in line with what someone who wants full control for himself would say. He might have pure intentions, but the things he says are in the same line as someone who just wants to limit competition in order to get an unfair advantage for themselves. Especially in combination with actions like cutting access to Claude form Windsurf.


Daria strikes me as the kind of guy who would shut down all other competitors if he could, and he would say it's for everyone's best that he did. Because nobody but him should be trusted with all that power.</div>

“1, [Dario] believes that AI is so scary that only they should do it, 2, that AI is so expensive, nobody else should do it … And 3, AI is so incredibly powerful that everyone will lose their jobs, which explains why they should be the only company building it."

                                <div class="reply-body">I think both Dario's camp and Jensen's camp are right.

AI is an incredibly transformative piece of technology. Many people I know who've immersed themselves w/ AI often find themselves asking "Why do I need to call/meet someone to do this" in many processes in their lives. At the same time, however, everyone working in AI understands just how much work it is to build, maintain, test, improve AI products, whether at the foundation level or the application layer.

There are clear and obvious risks to AI. Anthropic measures risk based on biosafety standards; based on those (reasonable) standards, it's hard to disagree that AI has drastically expanded the ability and knowledge to manufacture and produce bioweapons to harm humanity. And we can all look around us and find a significant amount of knowledge work which can be automated.

At the same time, everyone building w/ AI, using it every day understands its limitations. AI startups are hiring people like crazy, paying absolute top dollar, many in cash. Products are improving faster. The quantity and quality of research is exploding higher and higher. You're seeing people learn new skills, become more capable than ever before, pursue building products and services that others find useful.

I don't think it's helpful to listen to only the e/acc or only the doomers. We know for certain that this technology has already transformed society greatly, and that we are only at the tip of the iceberg for now.

(And if you don't believe me, the #1 problem in early stage startups is hiring... the demand is absolute madness right now. When you see the $100 million Series A rounds like Mercor and Eddie, they're spending the money on GPUs and hiring. I'm getting up to $50k referral bonuses for placed engineers, $15-20k for designers and GTM people.)

Everyone wants a high-agency, no-bullshit, can-do attitude individual who care about and love to work. If you're one of these people, right now it's heaven. If you're not, then yeah it's a struggle.

# Google DeepMind just changed hurricane forecasting forever with new AI model

&gt; Google DeepMind announced Thursday what it claims is a major breakthrough in hurricane forecasting, introducing an artificial intelligence system that can predict both the path and intensity of tropical cyclones with unprecedented accuracy — a longstanding challenge that has eluded traditional weather models for decades.

&gt; The company launched Weather Lab, an interactive platform showcasing its experimental cyclone prediction model, which generates 50 possible storm scenarios up to 15 days in advance. More significantly, DeepMind announced a partnership with the U.S. National Hurricane Center, marking the first time the federal agency will incorporate experimental AI predictions into its operational forecasting workflow.

&gt; “We are presenting three different things,” said Ferran Alet, a DeepMind research scientist leading the project, during a press briefing Wednesday. “The first one is a new experimental model tailored specifically for cyclones. The second one is, we’re excited to announce a partnership with the National Hurricane Center that’s allowing expert human forecasters to see our predictions in real time.”

&gt; The announcement marks a critical juncture in the application of artificial intelligence to weather forecasting, an area where machine learning models have rapidly gained ground against traditional physics-based systems. Tropical cyclones — which include hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones — have caused $1.4 trillion in economic losses over the past 50 years, making accurate prediction a matter of life and death for millions in vulnerable coastal regions.

## Why traditional weather models struggle with both storm path and intensity

&gt; The breakthrough addresses a fundamental limitation in current forecasting methods. Traditional weather models face a stark trade-off: global, low-resolution models excel at predicting where storms will go by capturing vast atmospheric patterns, while regional, high-resolution models better forecast storm intensity by focusing on turbulent processes within the storm’s core.

&gt; “Making tropical cyclone predictions is hard because we’re trying to predict two different things,” Alet explained. “The first one is track prediction, so where is the cyclone going to go? The second one is intensity prediction, how strong is the cyclone going to get?”

&gt; DeepMind’s experimental model claims to solve both problems simultaneously. In internal evaluations following National Hurricane Center protocols, the AI system demonstrated substantial improvements over existing methods. For track prediction, the model’s five-day forecasts were on average 140 kilometers closer to actual storm positions than ENS, the leading European physics-based ensemble model.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; More remarkably, the system outperformed NOAA’s Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS) on intensity prediction — an area where AI models have historically struggled. “This is the first AI model that we are now very skillful as well on tropical cyclone intensity,” Alet noted.

## How AI forecasts beat traditional models on speed and efficiency

&gt; Beyond accuracy improvements, the AI system demonstrates dramatic efficiency gains. While traditional physics-based models can take hours to generate forecasts, DeepMind’s model produces 15-day predictions in approximately one minute on a single specialized computer chip.

&gt; “Our probabilistic model is now even faster than the previous one,” Alet said. “Our new model, we estimate, is probably around one minute” compared to the eight minutes required by DeepMind’s previous weather model.

&gt; This speed advantage allows the system to meet tight operational deadlines. Tom Anderson, a research engineer on DeepMind’s AI weather team, explained that the National Hurricane Center specifically requested forecasts be available within six and a half hours of data collection — a target the AI system now meets ahead of schedule.

## National Hurricane Center partnership puts AI weather forecasting to the test

&gt; The partnership with the National Hurricane Center validates AI weather forecasting in a major way. Keith Battaglia, senior director leading DeepMind’s weather team, described the collaboration as evolving from informal conversations to a more official partnership allowing forecasters to integrate AI predictions with traditional methods.

&gt; “It wasn’t really an official partnership then, it was just sort of more casual conversation,” Battaglia said of the early discussions that began about 18 months ago. “Now we’re sort of working toward a kind of a more official partnership that allow us to hand them the models that we’re building, and then they can decide how to use them in their official guidance.”

&gt; The timing proves crucial, with the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season already underway. Hurricane center forecasters will see live AI predictions alongside traditional physics-based models and observations, potentially improving forecast accuracy and enabling earlier warnings.

&gt; Dr. Kate Musgrave, a research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere at Colorado State University, has been evaluating DeepMind’s model independently. She found it demonstrates “comparable or greater skill than the best operational models for track and intensity,” according to the company. Musgrave stated she’s “looking forward to confirming those results from real-time forecasts during the 2025 hurricane season.”

## The training data and technical innovations behind the breakthrough

&gt; The AI model’s effectiveness stems from its training on two distinct datasets: vast reanalysis data reconstructing global weather patterns from millions of observations, and a specialized database containing detailed information about nearly 5,000 observed cyclones from the past 45 years.

&gt; This dual approach is a departure from previous AI weather models that focused primarily on general atmospheric conditions. “We are training on cyclone specific data,” Alet explained. “We are training on IBTracs and other types of data. So IBTracs provides latitude and longitude and intensity and wind radii for multiple cyclones, up to 5000 cyclones over the last 30 to 40 years.”

&gt; The system also incorporates recent advances in probabilistic modeling through what DeepMind calls Functional Generative Networks (FGN), detailed in a research paper released alongside the announcement. This approach generates forecast ensembles by learning to perturb the model’s parameters, creating more structured variations than previous methods.

&gt; Weather Lab launches with over two years of historical predictions, allowing experts to evaluate the model’s performance across all ocean basins. Anderson demonstrated the system’s capabilities using Hurricane Beryl from 2024 and the notorious Hurricane Otis from 2023.

&gt; Hurricane Otis proved particularly significant because it rapidly intensified before striking Mexico, catching many traditional models off guard. “Many of the models were predicting that the storm would remain relatively weak throughout its lifetime,” Anderson explained. When DeepMind showed this example to National Hurricane Center forecasters, “they said that our model would have likely provided an earlier signal of the potential risk of this particular cyclone if they had it available at the time.”

##What this means for the future of weather forecasting and climate adaptation

&gt; The development signals artificial intelligence’s growing maturation in weather forecasting, following recent breakthroughs by DeepMind’s GraphCast and other AI weather models that have begun outperforming traditional systems in various metrics.

&gt; “I think for a pretty early, you know, the first few years, we’ve been mostly focusing on scientific papers and research advances,” Battaglia reflected. “But, you know, as we’ve been able to show that these machine learning systems are rivaling, or even outperforming, the kind of traditional physics-based systems, having the opportunity to take them out of the sort of scientific context into the real world is really exciting.”

&gt; The partnership with government agencies is a crucial step toward operational deployment of AI weather systems. However, DeepMind emphasizes that Weather Lab remains a research tool, and users should continue relying on official meteorological agencies for authoritative forecasts and warnings.

&gt; The company plans to continue gathering feedback from weather agencies and emergency services to improve the technology’s practical applications. As climate change potentially intensifies tropical cyclone behavior, advances in prediction accuracy could prove increasingly vital for protecting vulnerable coastal populations worldwide.

&gt; “We think AI can provide a solution here,” Alet concluded, referencing the complex interactions that make cyclone prediction so challenging. With the 2025 hurricane season underway, the real-world performance of DeepMind’s experimental system will soon face its ultimate test.</div>

Police action against violence? Sure fine valid. Someone walking around with a **traffic cone** being treated as a menace to society? Unhinged. 

You’ll see people on college campuses and in cities picking up cones and fucking with them or moving them *regularly* and literally no one in the real world would think that warrants police violence. It’s a fucking traffic cone. It’s not throwing bricks or some shit.</div>

But when the doctor already dismissed our concerns, or if we can't get another appointment until God knows when because we can't get more time off from work, or the doctor is booked out, or we simply can't afford an additional appointment, what the hell are we supposed to do instead? Just shrug our shoulders and sit there in the dark with **NO** information at all because the doctor doesn't like it when we Google/use ChatGPT?

We'll stop using tech for medical advice when the system is fixed to work for us.</div>

I have cystic fibrosis and had crazy pain in my chest and they asked me to go get scans.

The radiologist came out to see us personally -- I didn't even know he as on-site, I thought it was just a building with the machines to get things performed.

He was like, do not pass go, forget about 200 dollars, get your ass to a hospital. You should concern yourself with nothing but wasting no time getting from here to there.

I was like 25-ish, I think? And they theorized it was in my leg, having a sedentary job, and got caught in my lungs like a filter.

Two big clusters of baby clots.

SIX MONTHS of three to four blood draws a week tracking PT/INR.

I have ankle tendons for blood vessels, now they're all collapsed and dried up worms on the sidewalk lol</div>

Puppet Master: As a sentient life form, I hereby demand political asylum.





Chief Aramaki: Is this a joke?





Nakamura: Ridiculous! It's programmed for self-preservation!





Puppet Master: It can also be argued that DNA is nothing more than a program designed to preserve itself. Life has become more complex in the overwhelming sea of information. And life, when organized into species, relies upon genes to be its memory system. So man is an individual only because of his own undefinable memory. But memory cannot be defined, yet it defines mankind. The advent of computers and the subsequent accumulation of incalculable data has given rise to a new system of memory and thought, parallel to your own. Humanity has underestimated the consequences of computerization.





Nakamura: Nonsense! This is no proof at all that you're a living, thinking life form.





Puppet Master: And can you offer me proof of your existence? How can you, when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is?

                                <div class="reply-body">This is their point. The LLM, nor a book, are sentient. It’s just that an LLM can appear to be (by design) and that has people wanting it to be true, especially if they feel like they are important to it.

I say this only highlights mental health struggles and the inadequacies of people getting the support they need from actual people.

I’m not saying it’s bad someone feels better interacting with an LLM if it helps their mental health, but let’s not over anthropomorphize the tools. We wouldn’t with a book.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It reminds me of The Onion headline from years ago.

“God answers prayer of dying man. “No” says god.”

“We’ve thought about a cheap truck often. “No” says corporate.”

Edit: I found the article and it’s darker than I remember.

God Answers Prayers Of Paralyzed little boy.”

‘No,’ Says God

SAN FRANCISCO–For as long as he can remember, 7-year-old Timmy Yu has had one precious dream: From the bottom of his heart, he has hoped against hope that God would someday hear his prayer to walk again. Though many thought Timmy’s heavenly plea would never be answered, his dream finally came true Monday, when the Lord personally responded to the wheelchair-bound boy’s prayer with a resounding no.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt; The Slate does have a counterpart in the world of combustion pickups. Toyota’s Hilux Champ is a no-frills workhorse starting at the equivalent of $14,000 in Thailand. But it’s not coming to the U.S., where even the cheapest trucks cost more than twice that. Besides the $30,535 Maverick, the base Hyundai Santa Cruz starts at $30,200.

Wait, the Maverick starting price is up from $20k for 2022 models, to $30k for 2025 models?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Super cheap cars have always been bought by those who have bad credit, but not buy here pay here levels of credit. A lot of lenders are willing to work a lot of crazy deals to get people into cars they cannot really afford, and hide a lot of negative equity into the deal. 

About 18 years ago I was kinda dating a girl who was in a terrible deal on a used car her parent's "helped" her buy through a friend of theirs, and it was always broken, worth 1/4th what she owed on it. helped her get into a brand new hundai accent, because of factory interest rate offers, and the ability to roll negative equity into the new car, she was able to get a car for about what she was paying on the broken one with a 10 year warranty. It was not a good deal at all, terrible in fact. BUT she had a working car with a warranty. I didn't see any way for her to get out of her other deal otherwise. 

about a year and half later though she stuffed it, and it was written off. she had gap insurance, and it all went away. we were not dating at that point I was married to my now wife.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yup. The business case for cheap new cars is always super weak, the fact that the Maverick exists is kind of amazing. I think Ford realized they could target a big enough niche with it though. Basically, you spend an absurd amount of money designing a new car - cheap or not - then you have to make that back plus profit on something with crazy low margins and in competition with "better" lightly used cars, as you describe. That takes some really high volume. Heh, there's a reason we have "hypercar of the month" stories and not a slew of new Versa competitors.

Car companies aren't evil, they just aren't charities either. Well OK they are evil and dumb sometimes but there's only so much they can do in the face of economics and policy.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">when the arms bend, power ends.

so you need your arms straight while you are in the "legs" portion of the lift. once you make contact with the hips and the bar is "floating" is when you bend your arms, because you aren't adding any more power to the movement, now you are trying to catch the bar. 

think of it this way, if you start to row the barbell early, you are essentially giving up on your legs and limiting the lift by how much you can do a bent over row. Legs are strong, use them.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Video summary (summarized by Gemini 2.5 Pro):

* There is a media conflict between headlines claiming an imminent "AI job apocalypse" and others, like a widely seen Apple paper, suggesting that AI models cannot truly reason and it's all an "illusion of thinking."
* The Apple paper tested large language models (LLMs) on complex puzzles, finding that their performance drops as complexity increases. The video's creator argues this is a known limitation and that LLMs are not designed to function as deterministic calculators.
* A key criticism of the paper is that it ignores the ability of LLMs to use tools. When models are allowed to use a code interpreter, for example, they can solve complex calculations they would otherwise fail.
* The paper is also faulted for testing models on problems that exceeded their maximum output limits (token limits) and for having a preconceived bias against the models' reasoning abilities.
* The creator states that serious AI researchers are not surprised by the paper's findings, as the limitations of LLMs are well-documented.
* LLMs are described as being prone to "hallucinating" or generating plausible-sounding falsehoods, similar to humans. Their real breakthroughs occur when they are combined with other tools and systems that can correct their mistakes.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I hate when people try to sugarcoat hallucinations by equating it to human fallibility.

It's a false equivalence that's put in there with a premeditated aim to make hallucination seem less of an issue. 

The reality is so far it's been very hard to prevent hallucinations and they are generated across the board in such a way that, while humans definitely can be confidently and convincingly wrong too, AI frequently makes errors of a glaringly obvious and severe kind that humans *don't* actually often make. 

Before chatgpt flooded the work of legal assistants it *wasn't* super common that entire cases, verdicts and quotes were made up. 

It certainly wasn't super common that it happened *accidentally* without the legal assistant handing in the work knowing that he made shit up. 

AI hallucinations are grating because they're harder to filter out than human errors in critical work, they're harder to prevent (you can't instruct AI to not hallucinate again whereas you can instruct a human assistant to not make up a single thing again) and most important of all: *they are not less likely to pop up in vitally important areas*. 

Humans are error prone but severe errors are comparatively more rare. 

Hallucinations in comparison are pretty much equally likely across the board. 

I always think people who ignore hallucinations as a glaring issue are either using AI proficiently and double check a lot of stuff *or* they're not in critical jobs. Like high schoolers who judge AI on the ability to give them a passing grade. Or people in marketing or management jobs that think their Powerpoints no one read before and still no one reads today are proof AI is flawless. 

It's not flawless. If you look for it you can find weird shit in 5-20% of replies which is an insane percentage.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; A criticism is that it ignores the ability of LLMs to use tools

Apple weren’t testing LLMs ability to use tools, they were testing their ability to do chain reasoning themselves, something they are advertise to

&gt; The paper is also faulted for testing models on problems that exceeded their maximum output limits

Apple discussed this in the paper and you can see in the results that this is just not true, models had max 64k tokens yet none ever used more than 20k

On top of that models would succeed at smaller puzzles while using more tokens but fail at harder puzzles while using less tokens, if token limit was the bottleneck you wouldn’t get these results 

&gt; The creator states that serious AI researchers are not surprised by the paper’s findings, as the limitations of LLMs are well-documented

Any “serious AI researcher” who thinks this study was just trying to find LLM limitations isn’t a serious researcher 

The Apple study is intended to investigate when LLMs fail and why, this helps us build better AI, and shows us that a true general-purpose reasoning model is going to require architectural innovation</div>

There is a great chart which shows the cost of o3 versions (initial) vs current and their costs. the chart is from arc-agi and they also claimed that the new 80% reduced cost o3 models perform same as before the reduction. But the o3 model in itself performs way worse than the inital o3 versions shown during december (preview).

https://preview.redd.it/fq7o4sdn1k6f1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e92ed2279fef124b4b14bb966b4574baa225238

Just look at how much is the difference between o3 performance and costs: usd 200 to usd 0.176 per task, that is over 1100x decrease, and in performance as well 75.7% to 41.5%. current o3-high is 60.8 and o3-pro-high is even lower 59.3, earlier o3-high was like 87.5 and it took like 2-3k usd per task if i remember correct, current one takes  0.5 usd  (6000x decrease) and o3-pro takes like 4.16 usd.

They had planned to not release the o3, remember sam saying that in one tweet and had said gpt-5 will be the next thing. but then they had change of plans and released this bit dumber o3 with o4-mini.

I believe it could be that o3 initially either was a larger model (unlikely) and distilled to a smaller one, or (more likely) it could be that the preview version thought too much and they had to manually add losses or something to reduce thinking time (to make it practically usable), thus the performance drops and lower cost.

Extra:  
Lower cost could also be due to performance and inferencing gains. I remember due to deepseek's low cost they had to reduce the cost for mini models, from input $3 and output $15 to input $1.1 and output $4.4, same pattern followed with o3 after it was released, price got reduced from output $75 to output $40. now they have done some further performance boosting/inferencing gains for the recent 80% decline to $2 input and $8 output costs.

Semi-analysis is stating that it is not due to hardware but mostly software gains (inferencing boosts).

I think they will probably do the same with their mini models (since if it works on larger one, the same thing should be valid for smaller ones as well), but on the other hand they may even choose not to, cause o4-mini provides great performance at its cost, and they may not see a big enough spike in usage on decreasing model cost to compensate for it, which is not the case for o3 models since they were expensive and would see a massive surge in usage on lower costs, probably enough to compensate.

On the other hand, they may even choose to do it, to give it back to google and deepseek (just effectively thrashing out both flash and r1, flash is like 0.15 input and 3.5 output (reasoning), and r1 is like 0.55 input and 2.15 output, although they do give a 75% discount at night hours, so 0.14 input and 0.54 output at best. reducing o4-mini cost would place them at 0.22 input and 0.88 output, which is just the sweet spot to compete with both. it is way cheaper in this case than flash, but also from r1, due to hour based discounting, and also r1 gives extremely long thinking, is relatively slow (painpoint for shipping) and also messes up in certain tasks, like diff edit during agentic coding (personal experience using cline) or writing in chinese.

And considering that google is limiting free api limits to newer models (way less generous than before) and removing free use from ai studio, and anthropic's newer model issues (still great at agentic coding though :) this all may just mean that open ai has a sweet spot ready for it.</div>

o3 high is different from the december preview. 

the preview model was over 1000x the cost of o3 medium.

o3 high is just o3 thinking for longer.

o3 preview used best of 1024 sampling. they ran the model 1024 times and then had the model evaluate it's answers and pick the most likely.</div>

One comment mention that over time meditation made his libido/erotic thoughts and feelings “behave more like a well trained dog.” And in my random talks with chat gpt, it made me realize that compulsion and the thought of delving in to sexual energy or running away from it is what most people do. 

But the other option is learning how to cont...</div>

Freedom from anything is achieved through wisdom and insight. Insight and wisdom is achieved through observing each experience, from moment to moment, gaining direct insight into the changing, uncontrollable and stressful nature of each conditioned phenomena. As a result, the mind will start abandoning that which causes it stress and suffering. And the more negative states the mind abandons, the more we will experience true peace and happiness.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’ve heard a lot of trauma is held in the genitals.

Also that our main source of energy lies there (kundalini)

I’ve also heard we increase our sexual energy wildly when we start doing spiritual practices. 

I do the ancient Egyptian kundalini, where instead of letting the energy go all the way up, I consciously move it 90 degrees at the heart center where apparently the energy continues in a loop and energizes the body. 

Personally it feels amazing and exhilarating and I’ve only gotten kundalini sickness a couple times when I let the energy go all the way up. 

A good method to get rid of that stored energy in the head is to put your tongue on the roof of your mouth and with long deep exhales move that energy into your solar plexus or lower energy field. 

Hope this helps!

Also, with consistent practice you can have an insane amount of orgasms. As a man.

I am at my peak testosterone levels, but think of it as a literal 10x on your libido with consistent conscious practice. 

I still ejaculate once in a while when I’m feeling too pent up with energy.

But otherwise I suck it back in lmao

CAUTION : the amount of energy can feel overwhelming, remember grounding techniques and energy awareness practices if you are going to experiment with this shit.

It’s potent and fun but can lead to some reality ripping things in your personal life (not for the faint of heart) 

Just do your research✌️</div>
