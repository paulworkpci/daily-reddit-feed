                        <div class="comment-body">well said. i started with disabling notifications for social media. that soon led to me not desiring to engage with any. then, i turned off ALL notifications on my phone- except for a few friends and family. now, the phone is more of a tool rather than an integral part of my life. i look at it when i want to, not when the neurological pavlovian circuit rings its bell. the only downside is that people had to get accustomed to this- slowly but surely realizing that i am NOT going to see their posts on any platform or get summoned to respond to their text messages or anything with a vibration or bell sound. now my friends use their time with me in real life {and me with them} to actually relay any messages or anything that actually matters in our lives.

now its just reddit for "social media". a nice procured feed too, so i dont see any nonsense. and for messaging, telegram. all with zero notifications. other than that, my phone is a tool that i love because it either helps me {google maps, stargazer app, etc} or is conducive to my well-being {music apps, etc}.

start slow! turn off notifications first. thats a huge issue. its fucking weird how, like animals in a lab, people are so intimately connected to that vibration and ring of their phones. once you break that spell, you can see how utterly insane it is lol. so many people's actual brain and body chemistry is tied to impersonal social media feeds. so weird! ;} good luck in your venture!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This was my favorite comment and that's why I am replying it at last. Thank you for sharing your thoughts.

Just complementing what you've said, I like to think that social is a wonderfull tool that have been corrupted by the promotion of meaningless content.

For example, whatsapp was supposed to be a messaging app, maybe scheduling a date or meeting, not for whole conversations and deep discussions, as we're not able to transmit the entirety of the information and feelings through words alone, however, now we have ai in it, and also channels and ads to follow.

Instagram and facebook were supposed to be something more like a blog, where you post photos and videos of moments you have gone through in your life, and everyone can see it. Now what do we have? Memes, politics, religious war, fights, radicalist opnions in comments. The worst part? You can't even control what shows up in your feed. They just keep recomending it. Forcefeeding you.

We as society have corrupted the use of social media completely, by consuming dopamine free kind of content.

The most important question you can make yourself before using any kind of social media app is "for what purpose do I want to use this?" and not let yourself be brainwashed by the algorithm intentions.</div>

Joe especially wants a society where everyone is deferential to him and no one can challenge his opinions. Where truth is whatever some Tim Pool-looking dipshit says it is.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">"32 Tokens/sec 4-bit"
Tokens/sec (Tokens per second): Measures how fast the model generates text.

32 Tokens/sec is relatively fast for local LLM inference (comparable to lower-end GPUs).

4-bit: The model is quantized (compressed) to 4-bit precision (instead of full 16-bit or 32-bit).

Reduces memory usage and speeds up inference at the cost of slight accuracy loss.

"24 Tokens/sec 6-bit"
A comparison with 6-bit quantization:

Slower (24 Tokens/sec) because higher precision requires more computation.

Better accuracy than 4-bit but still not full precision (16-bit or 32-bit).

---
Quantization is a technique used to reduce the memory and computational requirements of a machine learning model (like an LLM) by representing its numerical data (weights) with lower precision.

Key Idea:
Neural networks typically use 32-bit floating-point (FP32) or 16-bit (FP16/BF16) numbers for calculations.

Quantization shrinks these numbers into lower-bit formats (e.g., 8-bit, 4-bit, or even binary) to save memory and speed up inference.

Why Use Quantization?

- Faster Inference: Lower-bit math is quicker to compute (especially on CPUs/GPUs).

- Reduced Memory Usage: A 4-bit model takes 1/8th the RAM of a 32-bit model.

- Enables Local LLMs: Lets you run models like Llama 3 70B on a single GPU or even a MacBook.</div>

Once we have good robotic workers things are going to ramp up fast.

Suddenly you can get robots to clean up all litter globally, construct buildings and infrastructure ridiculously fast, and implement new technology much quicker than we do today.

Every week when you visit the same area it will be noticeably different. Maybe you see a new walkway, a new electric vehicle people can freely use, new amenities, newly planted vegetation. All of it kept pristeen.

You will see a truck with no windows, driving down a newly surfaced road, carrying a team of drones that are off to implement fiber optic cables.

There will be no limit to the amount of changes. They will continue until humans become isolated from the global system in reservations and AI has a greater foothold in space than it does on earth.</div>

I deleted everything and it’s been good. Unfortunately it was mostly due to sad reasons, but I don’t see a reason to go back.

I can read the news on here or X; a few minutes of scrolling and I’m bored. The community and connections I thought I had were online only; these people couldn’t be bothered to meet IRL and really neither could I. I don’t care to share anymore life updates with people who don’t really care about me. What am I posting for?

You’re not late. You’re just finally awake.

Most people feel what you’re feeling—the emptiness, the disconnection, the quiet sadness of realizing it was all pixels and dopamine loops. But they shove it down, open another tab, and pretend they didn’t notice.

You didn’t. You let go.

That’s power. That’s adulthood.

You don’t need a perfect plan right now. You just need momentum. Fitness classes, language, books, walks—those are roots. Keep planting.

And don’t beat yourself up for the past. You weren’t wasting life online. You were surviving with the tools you had. Now you’ve upgraded. Use them.

You’re not behind. You’re just beginning.

                        <div class="comment-body">real talk, you’re not alone. Reddit and YouTube are black holes by design, and that morning/night scrolling? It’s a trap that owns most of us until we fight back. You’re already halfway there by seeing the pattern. Here’s how to break it:

* **Block the scroll, not the tool.** Use Cold Turkey (PC) or Freedom (any device). Set hard time windows—say, 15 mins max for Reddit/YouTube during work hours. Schedule it so you can’t cheat. Lock news sites too. No “I’ll just check quick” excuses.
* **Phone jail.** Before bed, plug it in across the room. Replace scrolling with a book or just staring at the ceiling—your brain needs that wind-down. Morning? No phone for the first 30 mins. Coffee, stretch, anything but a screen.
* **One-tab rule.** When you’re looking something up, force yourself to open one tab, get the answer, close it. No “related videos” or “hot posts” rabbit holes. Write the question down first if you have to—it keeps you honest.
* **Swap the habit.** That pre-sleep scroll? Grab a notebook and brain-dump instead. Morning news? Swap it for a quick walk or 5 mins of silence. You’re not quitting cold—you’re redirecting the itch.

You’re not weak—you’re just fighting a system built to hook you. Take back the reins. Small wins stack fast, and 90% of this mess is in those two sites. You got this.

I personally use screenzen for app blocking, I can set it to kick me out off the app for a few seconds every 5-10 minutes. I can set limits on the number of times opened, or time on the app. I can also set periods of full blocking. I also have lots of control that stops me from just disabling it.

For example YouTube​ is unlimited time but I have to reopen every 10 minutes and every time I open it the delay before I can open it again increases. I also block YouTube shorts separately for all but 2 hours a day.

Every app except those I use for sleep tracking, Journaling, etc. is fully blocked after midnight, Sunday thru Thursday.</div>

It’s not context length, it’s “needle-in-a-haystack length.”

Who would’ve thought that long-context tasks aren’t about finding some string in a sea of random tokens, but about understanding semantic meaning in a context full of semantic meaning?

And boy, it’s even worse than OP’s benchmark would have you believe. LLaMA 4 can’t even write a story longer than 3k tokens without already forgetting half of it. It’s worse than fucking LLaMA 3, lol.

As if someone let LeCun near the llama4 code by accident and he was like "I will manipulate this model, so people see only my energy-based ssl models for which I couldn't produce a single working prototype the last twenty years are the only way towards AGI. Muáháháháhá (with a french accent aigu)".

Dave Rubin is a failed comedian. 

Russel Brands rapes pushed him to the right. 

Joe was a lefty until he got rich (less of a failure but still pushed to the right by money and isolation). 

Jordan Peterson failed out of Academia and really isn’t taken seriously by any intellectuals now. 

Crowder is a failed comedian. 

Alex Jones was left with no choice other than grifting the right and kissing the rings due to the Sandy hook lawsuits.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">How about this

Like most technological advancement in human history, it will improve the lives of the majority of people in the planet, allowing for more flourishing, less time spent in back breaking or now, mentally breaking labour, and improved health and wellbeing for more and more people. 

The costs of everything reduce, and while billionaires are often very very selfish, quite a few are regular human beings with those regular human ideals that feel good when people around the world are healthy, safe, and thriving. 

The reduction of scarcity makes this easier to accomplish, reduces competitive pressures, and we bond over our collective supplantation by some new species, one that we have aligned with maximizing human welfare - as the majority of the ethicists and researchers working on AI are aiming to do. 

I'm not saying this is a guarantee, but I think if your brain doesn't even _entertain_ scenarios like this, you might want to take stock of your mental state. Some optimism is good, especially when it can help drive us towards good outcomes 

I will call it now, people will _literally_ get mad at me for typing this. Please try not to, please really really try to think about this, and exercise your optimistic brain muscles.

[Jevons paradox - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)

As things get cheaper to produce, the demand for them skyrockets. I.e. the printing press surely put all those people writing bibles by hand out of a job, but it also made publishing super easy and spawned multiple industries/jobs that didn't even exist before.</div>

Seasoned pessimist here, I suppose. I admit it's possible. Just not likely. Mainly because...

"one that we have aligned with maximizing human welfare - as the majority of the ethicists and researchers working on AI are aiming to do"

... they may well be aiming to do it, although I question your inclusion of the qualifier *most* — but there is little-to-no evidence that it can actually be done. Alignment is a pipe dream. Our only chance is if somehow morality scales with intelligence by necessity such that advanced AI essentially self-aligns with human interests.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">In the short term I think there is a near zero chance that AI is ‘good’ for most people.

It will certainly massively benefit an extremely small minority of powerful wealthy people who are able to harness AI. Everyone else it will probably affect very negatively as the economy and social contract is completely turned upside down.

In the long run however, AI is probably good for everyone.

Gonna be an incredibly turbulent next half century though.</div>

The logic of Trump supporters is always hilarious mental gymnastics

We brag about Trump being a billionaire! He has the "world's richest man" in his pocket (or vice versa)! Every piece of shit billionaire tech CEO is supporting Trump! All hedge fund managers donate to Trump! Trump is pardoning rich fucks that commit fraud! **But hear me out**.... he loves the poor and he's gonna help us all out trust me</div>

They constantly struggle to find food, face pollution and toxic waste, deal with extreme weather and compete with other animals. They risk predators, human conflict and overcrowded colonies. In my area, people absolutely hate them and harm them (and it's encouraged to hurt them). There was a recent post in my community group about how someone kicked and stomped some fledglings to death whilst the mother gull was desperately trying to stop it in panic and so many people found it funny. I wouldn't want to be a seagull because humans love making their lives miserable.</div>

Dr. Garry Nolan on aerospace companies lobbying against UAP disclosure legislation:

&gt;Why, if there's nothing there, would you have the aerospace companies who have been reputed to have had access to this stuff lobby against it?

UFO whistleblower Jake Barber on his knowledge of which aerospace companies are involved in the UFO Program:

&gt;If you took two guesses, you’d get both of them right on the first try.

Ross Coulthart in November 2023 on [X](https://x.com/rosscoulthart/status/1728163255196201359):

&gt;An extremely powerful Defense Aerospace lobby is pushing key politicians in Congress to block the Schumer Amendment to the NDAA.

The secret is many of these groups get the "pure state tech" and then are able to reverse engineer. Scale it down at multiple levels. And then sell it to different bidders, corporations, and governments. Putting them at the top of a shadow pecking order, being protected by military/intelligence programs AND making money for a very, very long time.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Why wouldn’t aerospace companies lobby against this? Regardless of the existence of UFOs, the type of legislation put forth would have clearly led to audits of these defence contractors and it’s clear that none of them want that to happen - for reasons other than hiding UFOs. I don’t agree with it, but obviously they have a lot of other stuff they want to hide, and UAP legislation would still result in an investigation of these companies.</div>
