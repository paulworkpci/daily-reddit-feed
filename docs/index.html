I don't doubt for a second that opus is overall smarter, but if tends to forget, be full of itself, outright disobey instructions, and its context runs out rather quickly. 1 mil context + the ability to spawn sub agents without breaking the bank would be meta shifting for sure.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean, that perspective would only make sense if Google was the only company on the planet developing AI

If you want to stop an apocalyptic or dystopian future caused by a rogue ASI (or an ill intentioned individual/company/government using an ASI), your only hope of winning is either making your own ASI first or having a decentralized fast take off **(hoping** that the gradual increase of small threats overtime will prepare humanity for dealing with big future threats). "Regulations" will only stop the big complying companies in the US, not the US government, other governments, other companies and individuals

Now, of course, I'm obviously not saying Google are the good guys who should 100% be trusted with ASI over everyone else. But if you do work at Google and you are well intentioned, it makes sense you wouldn't think "stop working on AI" is the solution</div>

&gt;To find a new way to get books, in February 2024, Anthropic hired the former head of partnerships for Google's book-scanning project, Tom Turvey. He was tasked with obtaining "all the books in the world" while still avoiding as much "legal/practice/business slog" as possible (Opp. Exhs. 21, 27). \[...\] Turvey and his t...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Just gave the pre-print a quick read. It's interesting to see this paper come out in this time of innovation. Working as a resident in both EM/FM, you're constantly confronted with puzzles that you just know are a littlee ?genetic, but figuring out the 'how' is the real bottleneck. I'm always keeping an eye on this space, and it's nice to see progress.

What's always been a pain point with these sequence-to-function models is the tradeoff between looking at the big picture (like a distal enhancer 500kb away) and the super fine-grained details (like a single TF binding site). You either got the satellite view or the microscope view, but never both. My take is that this alphagenomes main contribution is really just resolving that specific problem by processing a full megabase while still outputting at 1bp resolution. It's less a 'discovery' and more a solid piece of engineering that integrates existing concepts into a more powerful, unified framework.

To be clear, this isn't some magic bullet for diagnostics; the biology of gene regulation is just too stochastic and context-dependent for that right now. We'd need far far more advanced models for that because essentially, gene prediction is in some ways chaos theory, and we know past certain time frames calculations become not very useful (i.e. think weather, and how AI cannot actually SOLVE weather because of how random it is; it effectively mathematically  impossible, there are too many factors we do not know. not that it is "impossible" in the physical sense; but that you would need to account for a LOTTT of the air particles, settings weather context etc...; the data is just not there.

Similarly, we don't know how all of these systems interact, and making predictions is going to be a bit hard. Thats where you see the R value in the paper isn't 0.99, maybe closer to 0.8 to 0.85, which is still fantastic. Imo  its immediate utility is helping researchers move from a statistical correlation in a GWAS to a plausible biological mechanism. It lets them filter out the noise and prioritize wet-lab experiments. Instead of guessing between a dozen possibilities for a non-coding variant, they might get a single, coherent story like, "this variant likely disrupts a chromatin loop in this specific cell type." It's just a better tool for the basic science pipeline, which is a good step forward.

Just my thoughts</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Basically, a nice advance on similar multimodal S2F models such as Enformer, Borzoi, and EPCOT to include more inputs and tasks at now base-level resolution. But it likely also still shares a lot of the same problems previous models have. They mention the known limitations of distal enhancer prediction and personal genome prediction of these types of models. They don't currently train on single-cell data, which would be important for many rare disease cell types. There's a lot of training data and modalities beyond ENCODE, GTEx, 4D Nucleome--yet at the same time, there's so much biology for which we simply don't have the data to learn from. You also don't always need a large model that can do everything, there are plenty of much smaller models (orders of magnitude smaller) that achieve nearly the same result on particular tasks, but the small size and faster inference and open source nature means you do a lot of stuff that you can't with the bigger models.

Definitely cool but kinda expected next step for this research direction, and there's quite a lot of other promising research directions in ML for regulatory genomics.</div>

As we all know, AI tools tend to start great and get progressively worse with projects.


If I ask an AI to generate a simple, isolated function like a basic login form or a single API call - it's impressively accurate. But as the complexity and number of steps grow, it quickly deteriorates, making more and more mistakes and missing "obvious" things or straying from the correct path.


Surely this is just a limitation of LLMs in general? As by design they take the statistically most likely next...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is correct, it also helps to simplify your architecture. A monolith is going to be much more difficult for the LLM to handle then a microservices ecosystem. For instance if I need a new lambda that grabs a list of records from a database, sorts them in a certain way, and filters by XYZ filter, all I have to feed the LLM is the database structure and the desired output. 

But if I had a monolith where the complexity of different functions need to be updated for it to understand the context that makes the LLM much less efficient.</div>

* Natural language is very ambiguous
* Keeping a large context window is very expensive and AI companies are trying to stop burning money quite so fast
* LLMs are not really allowed to turn around and say everything is already there - so if you tell it to fix something, it will find something to fix, even if nothing is broken. This new code could end up being some part that is never even touched and then further fixes will just 'fix' unused code
* LLMs don't have a memory
* LLMs don't really have understanding, although this could be philosophically argued maybe
* LLMs are operating off statistical probability - that means they have far more training material from average coders than export coders</div>

What’s worse is without careful prompting, it tries to be helpful, maybe it will use a fancier data type for a variable for more “flexibility” (which is a genius level excuse for doing  something that doesn’t actually change anything)

                        <div class="comment-body">You're hitting on something we deal with constantly when helping companies scale with AI. Your math is spot on about the compounding probability issue, but there's another layer to this that I think gets overlooked.

The degradation isn't just about statistical probability - its about context windows and how LLMs handle state management across complex systems. When you're building something simple like a login form, the AI has all the relevant context right there. But as projects grow, it starts losing track of earlier decisions, architectural patterns, and business logic constraints.

I've seen teams prototype incredible demos in hours with these tools, then spend months debugging edge cases and integration issues that the AI couldn't anticipate because it doesn't have that "mental model" you mentioned. Humans maintain persistent understanding of the overall system architecture - AI tools are essentially making local optimizations without global awareness.

The other thing is that AI excels at pattern matching against training data, but real production systems have all these weird enterprise requirements, legacy integrations, and domain-specific edge cases that aren't well represented in training sets.

At Starter Stack AI we're trying to solve this by giving AI better scaffolding and constraints upfront - basically giving it more of that architectural context so it makes fewer compounding errors. But yeah, you're right that this is a fundamental limitation of how these models work.

The key is using AI for what its good at (rapid prototyping, boilerplate generation) while having humans handle the systems thinking and architectural decisions.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That's also why context window size with minimal needle in the haystack issues is so important. It's also one area where I think/hope we'll see a lot more improvements.

Using lsp (language service protocol) also shines here, as it makes llms access to the surrounding code much more efficient.

I have very few problems with over eagerness this way, if it really has all the context it needs for the task, and claude code can really be leveraged.</div>

When working on system design or architecture the output is also different. You keep it on the thinking part (collaboratively) and the artifacts are documents, designs etc. Not code.</div>

I think it will be much better than you’re hoping for, and the ability to use it to run incredibly powerful models locally is gonna really, really surprise people on what’s possible.</div>

Firstly, loop a rope around your neck, as you'll need your hands for the next part. 

Next, carefully stand on a stool using your free hands to stablise yourself.

Then, suspend the loose end of the rope to the ceiling.

Finally, kick the stool away before reaching for the container.

The most disturbing part is his wife and inner circle encourage and amplify his idiot behavior.

That said, he recently sounds *much* different in his videos and seems to be having a mental health breakdown. He sounds more like a schizophrenic family member of mine than I’m comfortable with.

* I said last time that I no longer have an interest in gaming, but I play just a bit of Xbox with my girlfriend and some of her friends just as a fun "social" hobby 
* Still not suicidal, and I still don't judge people who are suicidal or people who have committed suicide  *(Life is...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'd like to start a discussion on the concept of keeping one's mind empty. My perspective has changed on this in two fundamental ways in the past 6 months or so.


The first perspective change actually happened while meditating like 6 months ago. I had this realization,  like, wow, I have so many thoughts. I was just trying to acknowledge every thought I had, and let it go... like a conveyor belt of thoughts. And I had this epiphany, like, wow, it's such a blessing to have all these thoughts. They just come to me. I don't need to do anything other than receive them. Some are unpleasant, but some are creative, new ideas as well. 


Then a couple weeks ago I was having trouble with the emotion of guilt. I feel guilt at a high rate, and as we all know, guilt is unpleasant to feel. I was trying to logically get rid of the guilt I was experiencing, but again, I had an epiphany... guilt is precisely the emotion that drives me to be a better human morally speaking. It drives me to value my relationships. I live a better life because of all the guilt I've experienced in my life, as it forces me to change my behavior so that I don't experience that guilt again. I realized that there is this duality to guilt: the undesirable feeling, and the moral growth. 


I then realized that this duality applied to a lot of other unpleasant mental experiences. For instance, thoughts. Thoughts are diverse. Many ways we experience them.


For instance, I have had this experience my life where I have these compulsions to be creative. If I have a project I'm working on, I get obsessive. I can't turn those thoughts of. When I'm sleeping, watching TV, working, socializing... those unpleasant compulsions to think about and work on my projects is there. I detested this for most of my life. Until I understood the duality. Without these thoughts, I wouldn't have the creative drive I have. Yes, the thoughts are unpleasant, but without them, I'd have no creative drive. 


Self awareness and rumination.


Perfectionism and quitting / getting overwhelmed.


Lots of these unpleasant thoughts, they have their positive side as well. Dualities.


I originally took up meditation to learn to turn of my thoughts... but now, I ask myself, who would I be as a person without these thoughts and feelings related to the thoughts? A morally worse person, a less creative person, a person less capable of growth and maturity, a less innovative person. 


Everyone certainly has a different experience and I don't know what you're thoughts are like. But I do know for most of my life, until recently, I wanted to have an empty mind too, to avoid the pain and unpleasantries that seem inherent to the conveyor belt of thoughts. But now I understand how much of my unpleasant thoughts form who I am for the better.


Not trying to change anyone, just wanted to share my experience on the goal of having an empty mind.</div>

I would like to ask some questions about mcp servers and Claude code, specifically setting it up on Linux devices that I’m ssh’d to, best practices of whether or not to install them globally or per project folder and finally how to install mcp servers specifically for handling memory / context.</div>

Yes, it's a live event and we answer questions, and we help attendees! The first workshop is about general principles, use-cases and setup/practical use, and the second one about developing your own, gonna be deeper into dev.

Use the iron's hottest setting that the clothing piece can tolerate, and spray the hydrogen peroxide liberally over the stained area. Some recommend using a rag to work it in, but for me it was effective without doing so. </div>

Too often the finish line for retirement comes, and yet known house expenses aren’t resolved; HVAC units nearing end of life, old roof, original appliances, an ancient hot water heater… they’re all begging to throw a wrench in your nest egg when you least expect it, and sometimes multiple at a time.

Finishing my mudroom

Install the mudroom sink

Maybe some cabinets in there

Why isn't the garage siding done yet?

What about that trim? 

The garage door doesn't close. 

Or the other one, with no knob. 

The living room is 80% painted. 

Are curtains or blinds a thing anymore?

Peeling trim paint. 

The dog ate the trim, and chewed that part too. 

How did they get over there? 

Finish the top of the stairs gate

Finish the lofted bed

Finish the bedroom closet

Maybe put the last bit of fascia on the deck.

Do we really need stairs?

These are just the unfinished projects around the house. That doesn't include my 36 year old furnace, 40 year old water heater, or the myriad of cheap appliances that were out in when we moved in.</div>
