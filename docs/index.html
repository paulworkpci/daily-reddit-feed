These papers were done by Anthropic and some of the newer research on Claude Haiku has completely upended the understanding of how LLMs work. Before the first token is even generated, the answer to a riddle or the ending of a poem is found, with thousands of parameters activated for even small contexts and responses. 

What anthropic also found is that LLMs plan out their responses, and they are NOT just scholastic parrots, but anthropic refuses to actually define what an LLM actually is doing here, and the words they do use are very telling, because they do not use the obvious words of almost-sentience. They are neither a scholastic parrot, but they aren't quite ... alive.</div>

Maybe she made a deal to be quiet while they investigate more and bring charges and they just strung her along until they saw she wasnt going to be quiet, hoping she would just shutup and go away. When she wasnt, especially because she was vocal about the last Epstein file dump being bullshit, they decided hmm....just take her off the board.

Who knows what was happening behind the scenes. I wouldn't be surprised if the Royal Family made the choice to off her when it was quieter than before when it would have been obvious it was them. Now....we dont know who it could have been right? Or was it a suicide? The waters are certainly muddled. Which in itself is a valuable outcome.</div>

I’m not giving you a hard time, it’s more rhetorical than anything, but the cost to value for AI is incredible compared to what you get for what you pay compared to any other point in history.  

Anyway, like investing - it’s best to do your research and understand what is happening and how, if you’re purchasing a service like this.    Also, read the terms.   You are responsible for resources you use, even if you think they should have “stopped it”.    This was even a thing at gas stations back in the day.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;curious how much the work you got out of that $11

quite possibly zero. $11 stings when what you are paying for is not necessarily a useable output but instead a single roll of the dice. getting something that works may require many such rolls, so the expense can add up quickly. there is also always the possibility that there is no number of rolls that can get you what you need, in which case you have paid just to learn that the LLM can't help you.

it may still be worth it in the final analysis, but that kind of uncertainty makes it psychologically painful over and above what the dollar amount itself might otherwise suggest.</div>

I'm autistic and like to say I'm "chronically misunderstood" because 90-95% of neurotypical people have no interest in making the tiny bit of extra effort to meet me where I'm at, in terms of not wildly jumping to assumptions and actually listening to me and trying to understand what I mean.

AI has been great for this. They can help me articulate things that I normally struggle with, because I can explain my struggle to them and they can help me come up with a way to express my needs and feelings in ways that NTs will actually listen to. It also helps with my social anxiety because I can practice conversations I'm dreading.</div>

Before LCDs and infotainment menus became a thing (before touchscreens), the centre console of luxury cars in the late 1990s and early 2000s was starting to resemble the cockpit of Concorde with a ridiculous array of buttons.</div>

And yet, some later cars had more features but much better controls without a screen. It's not that they needed infotainment menus, it's just that they need to spend some thought on good design.

Physical controls cane be designed well or poorly, and screen interfaces can designed well or poorly.</div>

The first step for meditation is to say, "I want nothing." For a few moments, keep all your desires aside. Then you are able to transcend desires during meditation.

# 2. I do nothing.

During meditation, do nothing. The tendency of the mind is to keep doing something or the other. We need to understand that meditation is not an act — it is the art of doing nothing.

# 3. I am nothing.

Usually, in society, we associate ourselves with labels — I am smart, I am weak, I am ri...</div>

Of course these are purpose built for the ARC competition, but these models are still doing genuine abstract reasoning here, they will have to figure out a way to replace the DSL with a more general one of course, but I feel that is a minor roadblock compared to actually solving the ARC tasks

Also I don’t think 60% is needed for any AI to start having the AGI effect on th...</div>

But now they have to explain every time that the test does not test for AGI directly, its goal is just to test for AI issues, with the goal to slowly but surely direct it towards AGI

If we learned one thing, the AI space sucks as naming things, or, humans attach far too much meaning to names.
I wonder what would have happened if Apple would have been founded in this day and age.</div>

Thus, nobody ever actually has to re-type some text they want. I'm guessing many or even most people don't know about this. It's not even brand-spanking new anymore, either, it's been around for a little while now.</div>

                <div class="post-content">When I first started, my box did in house programming. I started going 5 days a week right from the beginning and made a lot of progress. About 8 months after I started they switched to mayhem programming. I started feeling like I could only make it 4 days a week and now, about 9 months after the switch, I don’t even want to go to the gym anymore. I’m strongly considering making the switch to more traditional strength training and just adding in the occasional metcon when I feel like it.

I did it for a few months when I took a break from CrossFit due to personal reasons (I eventually got back to my old gym). 

Even the dumbbells track was incredible. 
The year I was off, I did street parking for a while and I enjoyed it, then I switched to LP. 
I liked LP better, and Pat is the cheerleading everyone needs! 

The FB group is actually really wholesome. Can’t say the same for SP facebook group lol</div>

It means a talented AI researcher is being exiled for months because of a bureaucratic technical error made by the researcher's immigration lawyer (from a previous employer) 3 years ago. And it's happening at a time when AI progress is week to week.

Some people interpreted my tweet as partisan but my complaint is about the system for high-skilled immigration in America, which has been broken for a long time under many administrations.</div>

You can't be saying "he should get a green card, she should get a green card". You can't determine immigration processes. You can go through the records and find cases to back up any narrative you want to create - because the immigration system is long, legal, and complex.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; Noam shouldn't have tweeted this and framed it politically without knowing the reason.

I'm look at Noam's initial Tweet, and I can't find anything political about it. It was Redditors and others who decided to take a kernal of truth and fabricate whatever they wanted to out of it (see the other thread, with hundreds of comments, where 90% of the comments are doing that).

There are problems with the process, and its correct for Noem to highlight it. And the people who try to paint this as being all the fault of one party or one politician carry a large part of the blame. As the followup says, the applicant has been waiting almost three years for a response from their application. The process has been broken for a long time, under many different administrations. Until people are willing to take off their partisan blinders and admit that, things won't get better.</div>

ChatGPT is becoming abusive...</div>

I tried it when it came out and I could not get better results from it than I would from using a regular LLM chat. 

My coding tools are: Claude Code, VS code + GitHub copilot, regular LLM chats. 
Usually brainstorm with LLM chats, get Claude code to implement, and then use vs code and copilot for cleaning up and other adjustments.

I’ve tried using cursor again and I’m not sure if it has something I just don’t know about. </div>

People made extensions to get basic informations like how much tokens u used and how much left but still there are 0 informations about how many call tools are used, for what it is used etc. If u are using standard plan you are fine, but pay as you go are a joke and u don't know how much u will pay for prompt.

People gave already a lot of feedback about it, even Cursor mods banned some users for saying too much.
Instead of giving features to show more informations and be more clear they just add MAX models and cut a lot of context from based models</div>

You're not meant to stick them directly to the frame like it sounds like you are doing. You're meant to attach a hook to hang the picture frames. You pull the strips down as per the directions and it will  stretch and come off without peeling.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is genuinely dangerous as well. There's so many emotionally vulnerable people who spiral down crazy conspiracy rabbit holes because ChatGPT is their only "friend" and it just mindlessly affirms everything they say like it's the smartest shit ever. There are people who literally believe they're modern-day prophets because their bestie ChatGPT keeps telling them their schizo rants are deep and subversive. You can see this happen in real time in places like r/artificialsentience, where they post things like [this](https://chatgpt.com/share/680cf591-58dc-8002-b829-9e33c3b16e83) and gaslight each other with mystical pseudoscientific language about recursion, echoes, mirrors, and resonances.

Strangely, he's right on this one, even if his numbers are off. And when everything is automated, the government *will* have to step in with regulations, because unemployment will eventually get out of control. Automations fine, we don't need people working monotonous jobs if we can help it. New tech always takes jobs, it is what it is. And it always creates jobs. But eventually it will become Imbalanced.</div>
