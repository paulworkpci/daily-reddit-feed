Replace "midget" with "black" or "gay" as see how it sounds. Also, "little midget" is tautological. To attribute his behaviour to his stature is almost as insane as what he's doing in that video.

Anyone who is remotely familiar with people who breed the "insecurity dogs" like pitbulls and the like will have seen far, far worse than this. The whole industry is tied around treating the dogs like shit so they can be as aggressive and intimidating as possible.</div>

i’m working in a team repo with pretty strict naming, structure, and patterns, nothing fancy, just consistent. every time i use an ai tool to speed something up, the code it spits out totally ignores that. weird variable names, different casing, imports in the wrong order, stuff like that.

yeah, it works, but it sticks out like a sore thumb in reviews. and fixing it manually every time kind of defeats the point of using it in the first place.

has anyone figured out a way to “train” these tool...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">how are you using ai? what tools are you using? whats your workflow? You need to properly manage the context you provide the LLM and use proper examples etc of existing similar code and patterns if you expect it to adapt. If you use tools like cursor or vs code you can define rules that are auto attached to specify some guidelines but with this stay concise. Usually when doing agentic workflows you should follow process lilke:

  
context priming -&gt; developing -&gt; reviewing

  
E.g first providing examples., let the ai read similar code etc. (priming) then having it implement the new stuff and then you review.

  
Not doing too much at once. If you use tools like claude code and have good guidelines defined and a good rule file to point to those guidelines claude does a good job already discovering your patterns and adapting to it.

  
At the end of the day all of this depends on your current tool access and workflow. Just asking for how to improve a process without actually telling us about the current one makes it hard to help :D</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yep, took it for a test drive. For the user experience, it's better than OpenAI's Codex cli but lacks Claude Code's more polished quality of life experience (for instance the ability to send a message while the model is working, or to auto-complete a file path with tab). 

As for the actual task, it's good because it uses Gemini Pro 2.5, but  it doesn't follow the instructions in Gemini.md so I had to re-tell it everything. Also Claude Code often goes beyond what I'm asking and does more things, which might be good or bad depending on who you ask. Gemini cli tends to do only what I'm asking, and sometimes a bit less. 

Another surprise is that in my past experience, Gemini Pro 2.5 wasn't very good in using tools. Using Codex CLI, which allows you to use any model (and that's really commendable from OpenAI), the OAI models and Claude used the tools without problem, but Gemini Pro and Deepseek failed miserably most of the time. Here, it is quite capable (but I strongly hinted at what it should do in my prompt).

Compared to Claude Code, it has a larger context so you can feed it more files without fear (up to a certain limit), and it's free for now, which is a big plus. Claude Code is however better and faster, particularly because of its ability to break some tasks and delegate them to sub-agents in parallel, but that's also why it's so expensive and why it burns tokens faster.

So for now I'll still keep Claude Code as my main drive, but when I exceed the limits, instead of using Aider I'm now going to use Gemini cli.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I wrote an [MCP server](https://github.com/pdavis68/RepoMapper) that's based on Aider's "Repo Map" functionality. It gives the agent a better understanding of the code and it's relationships. It's not a static map. The LLM passes in filenames from the conversation and the repomap follows the graph of relationships between the files and then assigns a relevancy score to the files. You can specify how much of the context to assign to it and a few other options. 

Only wrote it over the weekend and haven't used it with Google CLI yet, so I honestly have no idea how helpful it would be, but it might improve things.</div>

Gemini failed miserably to follow instructions properly and the end result wasn't even close. It didn't know the limitations of the console it was using either, which resulted in me having to force Gemini CLI and the program I had it creating to close. 

Claude created a proper plan, and executed it when I was ready, but only when I was ready. The plan was very detailed and appropriate. It took a couple tries to get everything just right, but it succeeded.</div>

That will have to be solved with Neural Implants, but yeah it’s closer than people think. You probably won’t be able to brute force a simulation of reality anytime soon but you can combine old school 3D gameplay rendering with modern AI filters to augment the graphics to look photorealistic.

As long as the animations and physics are decent enough too. You wouldn’t be able to put a filter over janky animations, so they would just need to improve smoother animations. Which is happening with UE5, they are finding ways to blend animations better.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The way to tell is different. My brother did an experiment, he gave the prompt of “girl playing guitar” to 10 different image generators and every single one of them gave a white young pretty girl playing an acoustic guitar in a rustic setting (when he did this idk but the principal remains see below)

The intentionality of the generation is what he pays attention to as an artist trying to spot ai from real. The way patterns are chosen, and the composition. If it’s generic or like Disney esc it’s typically AI, with tons of detail and lighting. It makes sense given an AI’s job is to give the least common denominator result for what’s being looked for. To generate a result to the prompt that the most percent of people would approve as a valid result from the prompt, or to go viral, get the largest audience possible. Hence, it lacks contrarianism, creativity, nuance to my knowledge. All these generated videos are very generic, while technically almost flawless. To me it reminds me of Disney and the fall of new movies, new AAA games and that sort. They’re all impressive technically, but they all feel the same since they’re catered to the broadest audience possible. Like the thunderbolts getting good ratings but poor reception. In a world over saturated in content, the next goal is to be different unique and interesting. To create the trend for others to follow, instead of following data and recreating what worked in the past</div>

Parts of the people look like they're in front of a green screen

With the sisters, the right one is more pixelated than the left one. The left one's chin looks "green screen" when she turns

I think a lot of it has to do with lighting. AI doesn't seem to register background lighting well. It does primary, just not others- like the sushi neon sign not impacting the guy, especially noticable when she was past</div>

These jobs are highly specialised and require lots of dexterity and human connection. I agree most other office based jobs are 100% gone and eventually AI will be programmed to cover all aspects of electrical engineering and other manual labour jobs. I think doctors and nurses will be the most protected jobs.</div>

For instance:

"At no point in the nearly half-billion years that Judd and her colleagues analyzed did the Earth change as fast as it is changing now."

James Black, who were the ones to initially identify carbon emissions as a contributing factor to global warming in 1977.</div>

“Let’s look at earth climate from 400 million years back to see we’re actually in a cooling period right now. Don’t mind the fact the earth is WARMING. Climate from 400 millions years ago is totally relevant to todays weather! Not like humans only started pumping co2 into the atmosphere 200 years ago or anything……”

There’s tons of dirty money that’s influencing scientists coming from green energy to incentivize us to shift towards greener sources. There’s def not any money in oil and they would never try and distort the facts around climate change! The billionaire oil Barons are simply honest folk!</div>

So someone told him that and he was like "yeah but it's cool how it helps me feel like I am understanding it". Buddy. Pal. No. That's not cool how it does that, that's actually a problem if you think you understand it and you don't actually understand it. Like a really big problem</div>
