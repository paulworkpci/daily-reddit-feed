I'm probably not the first person to think or post about this but I need to talk to someone about this to get it off my chest and my family or friends simply wouldn't get it. I was listening to a podcast talk about the Kardashev Scale and how humanity is a level 0.75~ and it hit me like a ton of bricks. So much so that I parked my car at a gas station and just stared out of my windshield for about a half hour.

                        <div class="comment-body">Building on the idea of AI as a potential Great Filter, it strikes me that many of our current, complex global challenges appear intractable given humanity's persistent inability or unwillingness to enact fundamental societal change. It seems we are, perhaps implicitly, deferring the expectation of solving these 'wicked problems' (innate animalistic tendencies charged by the capability of the mind) to a post-AGI future. If that premise holds, it suggests that humanity, operating within its current paradigm, may never achieve a Type 1 civilization status, precisely because these unsolved problems act as our inherent limitation or filter. Consequently, the path to a Type 1 civilization might only be traversable by AGI, if and only if humanity relinquishes effective governance or stewardship of the planet to it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The most important thing that counts for the survival of a species on this planet is: 


- how widespread is the species (is it endemic or not)
- how big is the species population (2,000 individuals = very bad, 1,000,000 individuals = very good)


We populate all habitats on all continents, we are 8.2 billion people. The population is growing and growing and growing almost every year. Child mortality was driven down to an insane level compared to any other species of earth. Survival rate of adults it crazy high.

Now will there be a population “collapse” in the future? I predict there is nothing, not climate change, not an asteroid, not a virus, not igniting all the atomic bombs in the world, that will decimate the human population to a level even below 500 million. Which is STILL way more than any mammal on earth. 

That our species is completely wiped out literally requires this planet to become totally and utterly uninhabitable. Which is nothing that is remotely possible to do. Seriously. Crunch the numbers. Look at the data.

Edit: Wow. I am surprised that upvotes trickle in for this one. I already braced for a shitstorm. 😅</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Counter argument on why AI is not a great filter: 

If AI destroys its creators that does not mean that the signature of that civilization ends. For example, if our AI ended humanity but still ended up building Dyson spheres etc for its own use, those spheres could be detected by other civilizations as evidence of advanced ‘life’ elsewhere. 

It also wouldn’t remove the past evidence of its creators (radio waves etc). 

AI resulting in the death of its creators would not necessarily (or even convincingly) solve the Fermi paradox, as the AI itself would presumably leave signatures, and we haven’t seen those either.</div>

What I do understand is that AI likely won't destroy us all, but people with AI might. It is a tool that could be used to create utopia or demand dystopia if given the wrong parameters. Again, it could be nonsense</div>

Other "Great Filters" seem infeasible - it's unlikely that a climate change would be a great filter, as Earth has gone through a lot of those in the past, and even humans survived multiple climate events. Meteorite or other natural cataclysm also seem unlikely, because they don't happen as frequently as to threaten civilization, and right now we have the technology to potentially avert some of them.

So what's left is AI, a wholly unexplored and barely understood technology. What further marks it as a candidate for "Great Filter" is that if another civilization developed a benevolent AI or even a replicator AI - we would've already faced it. So that makes AI a real "black box" in terms of outcomes to us.</div>

When you sign up with wayfair as a vendor, you agree not to run out of stock before X date or get fined Y dollars.  


Rather than over-produce and be stuck with 500 shittily made gazebos, you wait until you have 1 left and jack the price up by Y.


Someone buys it at the ridiculous price?  Awesome you're still in the black.  No one buys it?  Cool who wants a free gazebo.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A lot of modern art is like that. There were some newly discovered Rothko's a while back. Rothko's own son, who manages exhibitions of his fathers work, thought they were real and beautiful. They sold for millions of dollars.

Then it was discovered that they were fake. Suddenly no one cared about the art, even though in a blind test even Rothko aficionados  said it was on the level of Rothko's other works. No one cared about the artist who was producing art on the level of Rothko. For all the claims of the transcendentalism that comes through the work, people were shown to just be paying for a credential.</div>

They are just extrapolating from the trend of the past  few years. The rate of change is actually accelerating too. From doubling every 7 months to now every 4 months. They aren’t claiming this will definitely happen but currently there are no signs of it slowing down.

Here’s the research

If this is tools like Cursor and Cline, it's a little interesting, but it counts about as much as anything bolted on to the providers' APIs does.

We're looking at OAI, Anthropic and co actually releasing agents that _they've_ built for this purpose later this year.  That's when we'll get some genuine insight.

I think a lot of the bolt-ons are going to be gone two years from now.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I know this is meant to sound like hyperbole to be used as counterargument, but is this not just how exponentials work? Moore's law predicted that computers would quickly be able to do computations that would take a human the current age of the universe to do, and indeed that was correct. I would predict a super intelligent AI is capable of tasks that would take a human the current age of the universe to do, if they could do it at all in the first place.

I think it's a bit unfair just to dismiss the possibility because it intuitively seems unlikely despite evidence to the contrary. 

  
There are many reasons why this may not happen but scalers should probably stop and ask if they are really confident those things will really slow us down that much.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes and no, 

The issue I see is that ARC-AGI has a limited distribution, most of the problems are relatively similar in term of what cognitive functions you need to leverage to solve them.

And my take on reasoning model is that they use verifiable problems to explore the problem space around that model, making them generalize very well in a very limited portion of the problem space.

Due to that, training on a task is very similar data as the testing will have a huge impact on benchmark performance (if the test set is in the narrow bubble near the training set) while not translating to arbitrary problem solving.

Hence it is a very good way to demonstrate few shot capabilities of these models, that are indeed best in class, but is clearly misleading if you are trying to evaluate the general reasoning abilities of the model.

So training on the train set in this kind of benchmark is good if you are assessing few shot learning, but not good to assess general capabilities.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If you are training models to perform ARC-AGI task and benchmark is a test for how well your model performs - sure. 

If you are claiming that you have a generalist model which should be able to pass a general task without training for it - it is definitely not ok.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes, this data is made explicitly to train models on what a successful interaction looks like. It's like teaching someone the rules of the game. Those rules do not have the answers for "solving" the game, anymore than teaching someone the rules of chess would. This is more relevant for general models, vs models specifically made to tackle arc agi.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">What is "legitimate"? What conclusions can be made when comparing the models, A - trained on a train split of a task and B - has no data for the task.  
I would argue that you can diagnose poor performance of A compared to B, since A has an unknown non-generalizable advantage.   
  
People are not going to use the models to run Arc-AGI.</div>

it should now be 300 uses of o4-mini-medium per day, 100 uses of o4-mini-high per day, and 100 uses of o3 per week which is infinitely more reasonable i now don't have to worry about it, i can just use it whenever i need</div>

If you find a baby bird on the ground the first thing to do is check for injuries. Baby birds can look pretty weak, but if you don't see any blood or obvious damage then it's fine. If it is injured do not try to take it home and nurse it back to health, birds require specific diets and ...</div>

Other -

I give talks to social media companies on using their platforms for science communication. Sometimes I get paid, sometimes I don't. 

I give talks at comic cons about the science and biology of super heroes and their plant and animal analogs. Think what is a "spidey sense" to a spider?

I have a podcast, Bugs Need Heroes, which I received a grant that covered its cost for a year. Science communication is very important to me. 

Currently an adjunct, hoping a full time position opens up now that I have my PhD. I finished last Friday! Woo!

That is a very interesting point over here, a lot of car enthusiasts say that we can't get rid of cars from urban areas like LA because cars are cool and stuff, but if we reduce the number of boring econoboxes on the road but still allow car enthusiasts to enjoy their cars, that could be great.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’ve lived in Japan, it’s one of the best places for car enthusiasts. It has amazing driving roads, a world famous vibrant car culture, cheap car cost (Porsches MSRP is 20% lower there) and virtually zero tariff for imports, and cheap fuel cost (comparable to the U.S). 

Yet it’s far less car dependent than the U.S and has a great public transportation system. It means there are far fewer bad drivers who don’t want to be driving in the first place jamming up the road. 

And because life isn’t dependent on driving, they have a much stringent drivers test to ensure a higher skill floor for people on the road, and old people are required to put stickers on their cars and re-do the test periodically. None of that would fly in the U.S unfortunately. 

That’s why I’m all for policies that reduces car dependency, it’s literally one of the best things for car enthusiasts.</div>

For some years now, I've been hearing all about the Law of Attraction, and how gratitude can be a practice to help you attract better things in your life. I get this principle, but for a long time, I was just using gratitude as a way of trying to get something I didn't ...</div>

It's good that you are centering yourself on yourself and your practice. Understanding your own mind, its desires and aversions, will help you navigate the world and your place in it... but also gives the benefit of great bliss when you relax and observe your thoughts and body. Intuition develops as we listen to the heart.

Love is what opens the door, not a lust for power or material possessions. To dismiss the past and future is a flaw in Buddhism, I feel. The gardener knows he must sometimes water his plants, and prepares. He stores food away for winter, and plants no more than he can harvest, otherwise it is wasted effort. Does the gardener need to love his garden? Maybe not, but it helps, I've found.

But first you must know what is in your garden: you must observe with curiosity and appreciation. A squirrel comes! A bird! A fox! The light of awareness bathes all, but love is the water that brings growth to a parched land. Ask yourself: what needs my care, my attention? Perhaps it is memories of the past that need forgiveness, for yourself and others. Perhaps it is anxieties over the future, in which case see yourself solving your problem, step by step, in your imagination. Perhaps it is the thought of a friend you wish to talk with. Imagine them smiling and happy to see you and what you would talk about. 

Let the mind loop about. If something keeps coming up, attend to it. Stir the depths of the earth with focused attention, as the dark beneath comes up to air, accept the rocks and flaws, pour love on the hurts, then relax and let it grow. There will be bad times. There will be good times. But for now, you simply tend to yourself, and with wisdom from experience, will then be able to tend to others, with compassion and love.

Know that you can always return to your self and your awareness, that you have... have... it all within. All you need is your bed, some simple food and water, and your cushion and you can be content.</div>

Now, no matter what I ask, whether it is instructions to re-pot a dying plant or details on a museum I am planning to visit, it always offers to turn whatever I am asking into a work related output. "would you like to draft a few paragraphs to insert your museum visit into your marketing publication?". I swear these bots are training *us* to be better productive cogs.</div>

It helps to do AI art. If you say "boy" it will give a random boy from 7-18, random hair, random eyes. If you say "7 year old boy, blonde hair, blue eyes, wearing a suit and tie, standing on a grassy lawn mid-summer" it will get very specific. But you have to make it that way.</div>
