                        <div class="comment-body">From a previous post of mine…

Just had a washer repairperson out to address water leaking around the door of my front loader. She saw my vinegar bottle sitting on the laundry shelf and asked if I used in the machine. Told her I used it with every load instead of fabric softener for a couple of years. She chuckled and said that Tik Tok vinegar vids have really boosted her business.

She taught me that the amount of water used in front load machines isn’t enough to dilute the vinegar like a top load. With regular use, it breaks down (she said “eats”) the rubber seals. Best case, you just get a smallish door leak like I did - but quite often, you get water inside the unit and fry the electrics.

For extra soil and odor, they recommend a laundry booster like Borax (20 Mule Team brand) which is machine-safe.</div>

Absolute dead eyes and he has like no human connection with any of his staff or members of his team. I am guessing autistic but he doesn't strike me as a pedo, just someone who is REALLY good at talking to a camera but not good at all talking to an actual live person.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">China asked for countries to unite against us due to the tariffs.  Do we have to cross our fingers and wait for the midterms if they even happen?

Edit: Trump "paused" the tariffs for 90 days, except China.  Do you think that the world will trust Trump and take their tariffs off as well?  I guessing they will say, H no!  Not until Trump is out of the White House.  Congress is now reacting to their own stock and CEOs screaming at them.  A handful have a bill taking tariffs out of Trump's hands.  

Trump is pausing because Elon is angry that he is losing too much money.  He called Navarro a moron and linked Milton Freedman's Zero Tariffs video.  Navarro is Trump's economic advisor.  Trump needs Elon's money to threaten that he will put them out of office by throwing money support against their campaigns.  Obama's economic advisor said that Trump has done permanent damage that can't be undone at this point.  

NYC had a protest march a mile long today.  

June 14th Trump wants a military parade in his honor for his birthday.  

42 bills against protests.  Remember if we get a chance to vote in the midterms, get rid of any Republican.  Start working on your non-voters and Trumpers now so they will be ready to vote against Trump in two years.</div>

Well done for speaking out, I wish I could do the same.
Your system looks quite broken, and the people in power seem to want to break it even further, or at least benefit from it.
Maybe I've listened too much to Bernie but you definitely desperately need to assess inequality. Living wage for all is not socialism. And you definitely have tre means to afford it.
And also, it seems to me you need to build bridges across party lines. Debate is healthy, vitriol and slander aren't.

I'm a little peeved now. Should I start posting on IG for this reason? I understand some people would prefer it if there's an update to your life you're willing to share. I'm a very private person, I'm n...</div>

being offline isn’t a red flag—it’s a *power move*  
especially in a world where everyone’s oversharing like it’s a job interview

if someone needs curated content to “trust” you, that’s not a friend  
that’s a consumer trying to browse your identity

real ones ask questions  
they don’t scroll for proof

if you're private, stay private  
your IG isn’t your personality  
your life doesn’t need an audience to be valid

                        <div class="comment-body">I just lurk here occasionally. And no, it's completely normal to have a neglected old Instagram account you don't update. Some people are more into Instagram than they should be. And it's kind of creepy imo how many people use Instagram to stalk exes/compare themselves to their friends, exes, colleagues. But I used to have an Instagram influencer as a friend who I cut loose because she had no boundaries. 

Your friend is being a red flag. If they want to know about your life they should just talk to you. 

Personally I enjoy sending silly Snaps of my cat to my friends and whatever shit I'm eating. And seeing their snaps. It feels less like a comparison race and more something fun.</div>

And the progress it has made is is much faster and more impressive than what Claude 3.7 has done in a similar timeframe.

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree, and the amount of progress being made here goes to show that memory matters. I know most humans wouldn't be able to memorize every pixel of every town/city/route/cave that they're in while playing the game, but humans can usually generally remember the overall layout of the current area they're in once they've explored it. So adding this feature feels like a crucial part of allowing the LLM to have some kind of functional short-term memory.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The tooling likely makes a huge difference honestly. But IMO this experiment just goes to show that if memory can be solved, huge breakthroughs are likely to happen. For SOTA models to progress onto long horizon tasks I think they'll eventually need to be able to remember things somehow, both in short-term and long-term memory. 



I wouldn't say that this experiment 100% proves that Gemini is better than Claude on this task. But I do think this shows that just by giving LLMs some kind of working memory their capabilities improve drastically.</div>

Also I think our brains are just subconsciously attracted to the negativity sometimes. I can scroll past a lot of posts but I'll click on the controversial one. Same thing with comment sections. Maybe it's similar to how we easily remember and replay harsh things people have said to us, but forget the compliments.

                                <div class="reply-body">90% of the firms in that sector are using their workforce like slaves. Big firms that contracted them should switch to this agent based solution because the IT-support firms that use specialists as customer service agents are 1. a total security risk (open guest accounts as backdoor to teams that use firm laptops with VPN to the big names, I have seen really big names with extensive Cybersecurity team and the cluelessness of contractors were the biggest sec risk) 2. total planless knowledge bases that are a total mess and teams operate at 20% SLA at best. Its a no brainer that AI-Agents that run locally and isolated or at least shielded without additional external operators can provide higher SLA rates, could manage a better knowledge base and minimize security holes (no VPN to external contractors, no legacy guest accounts, no legacy accounts, no laptops that could be accessed by someone else). The big names in this service business will die out.</div>

That’s it. No fancy tools, no complex systems. Just removing the biggest distraction.  
Now I actually finish tasks faster and with more focus.  
Sometimes, it’s the simple habits that make the biggest difference.

Anyone else tried something small that had a big impact?</div>

Errors will likely always be a problem. Even when humans do the coding it happens.

It includes part of a sidewalk, the corner of a parked car, a hedge in the background or other misc elements. The photo has a touch of motion blur, and mildly overexposed from uneven sunlight. The angle is awkward, the composition nonexistent, and the overall effect is aggressively mediocre—like a photo taken by accident while pulling the phone out of a pocket.</div>

**The Solution: Decision Density Mapping (sounds fancy, but it's actually simple)** 

Here's the weird system I accidentally created:

\-Grab a notebook and track EVERY decision you make for 3 days (warning: it gets depressing fast)

\-For each decision, jot down: how much mental energy it took (1-10) and how much impact...</div>

How is this even feasible?  I make 20 decisions an hour on smaller and larger scales.  Just writing them down and rating them will take more time than is possible in a day.  

I just made a decision to answer this post.  Mental Energy: 1, Impact: 1</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You're absolutely right - tracking EVERY decision would be completely insane (and probably drive anyone to madness).

In practice, track only decisions that require conscious thought (not "should I respond to this email" but "how should I handle this tricky client situation").  
Focus on work/productivity decisions, not everything ("banana or apple for snack" isn't worth recording).  
Try it for 2-3 hours a day for a few days, not constantly

When I tested this on myself, I realized I make about 30-40 "meaningful" decisions daily, not thousands. Those are the **key choices** that actually impact productivity.</div>

This is not his first time pausing tariffs either, each time we've seen the market rebound quickly, but this one was the biggest.

This is why blanket emergency declarations like he issued to make these tariffs “legal” are bullshit. Taxes and tariffs are supposed to be the purview of Congress, not the executive. This will he/wont he nonsense drama is exactly why this power shouldn’t exist with the president.</div>
