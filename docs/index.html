The space is filled with hype, hot takes, and vague vibes but surprisingly few people share concrete experiences - I could list just 2 blogs I know.
This post isn’t another "just vibe with it" rant. I want to talk about what actually works (and what doesn't!) right now, for us.

                        <div class="comment-body">I work for a fairly high-end tech consulting company. We're heavily invested in AI. The team I'm currently on is wrapping up a short 7 week project. Three developers all using Cline and Gemini 2.5 Pro. We completed all the required functionality early on, about week 3 or 4, and then we've been doing client wish-list features since. We absolutely crushed it. We used AI in all kinds of ways, not just writing the code.  The app used LLMs quite a bit internally as well (it's a sort of document system). 

We created rules and stuff to aid Cline.   
  
Before creating our PRs, we'd give a diff to Cline and ask it to do a code review (ironically on the code it mostly produced). This was a great initial review. Then we'd do a normal PR review.

Nobody's "vibe coding". We're all serious professional developers. LLMs are a tool and we use them to great effect. On greenfield project you'll get the most bang for your buck, but even with mature systems, LLMs can be perfectly useful. 

Like any tool, it takes skill to master. I think too many people think that LLMs suck because they can't get them to do anything well, but it's usually just their inability to properly operate the LLM.</div>

Email is NOT a storage medium. Also, good luck getting 2FA to work when you're in a foreign country and also your phone was stolen. Also, it's the most attacked thing in the digital world, so most likely to be used by an attacker. (But usually is just used to spread malware to everyone in your contacts list.)

Just make a physical printed copy of important documents and keep them separate from the originals.

Need a digital version? USB stick.

Still need a cloud-accessible version? Use a cloud STORAGE system with its own separate 2FA, like Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, Dropbox, etc.</div>

The computers were more primitive and you needed to know more. I'm sure my predecessors with punch cards felt the same.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I would agree, but for a slightly different reason. And extend it maybe to 20-40s. I think the critical part is that we finished our educations before AI, so we learned critical thinking, how to design software, how to write, how to read and comprehend, how to craft arguments, and art, and ideas. This makes us able to harness the AIs and guide them towards truly exceptional outputs. If I’ve never learned to write well, or to read deeply, I can’t possibly tell if the AI’s writing is great, good, or merely grammatically correct. We (20-40s) have broad enough knowledge and experience to know when something sounds suspicious and needs to be fact-checked. We know what’s under the hood and what came before. And, for what it’s worth, we had the joy of experiencing our minds expanding as we learned, challenged ourselves, and achieved milestones that were hard-won. Those just starting school will not know most of this. They won’t know how or why things work, just that they do. This makes them extremely vulnerable to outsourcing an outsized portion of their intellectual capacity. I feel bad for everyone who comes after us.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The timing on this post is genuinely strange. I've been thinking about this exact issue over the past couple of days and reached the same conclusion.

I recently visited my family, and my mum did something she's always done that I'm now realising completely reinforces my social anxiety. When my dad popped out, she came over and said, "Oh, I really wish you hadn't said that to your dad earlier. He's probably going to feel upset."

This really struck me because I already struggle quite badly with social anxiety and have virtually no local friends. I'm constantly ruminating over every social interaction, having to reassure myself, "It's fine, everyone has awkward moments, they're not scrutinising every word you said the way you are. We all just have a tendency to put the attention on our selves."

It helped me connect the dots and observe the pattern: how it was established and why it's so entrenched in me.

I genuinely believe that those of us who grew up being shamed or made to feel like failures (even when it was unintentional and we have good, supportive parents otherwise) can absolutely work through these issues. It just requires quite a lot of effort and patience with ourselves.

Sending positive thoughts to anyone else going through this. It's tough, but we'll pull through.</div>

It might be a bit rough to watch a one-hour movie comprised of only 8 second clips, but some clever editing and well-placed transitions could  somewhat mitigate that. 

But when Veo 4 drops (later this year?), they might increase the clip length to, let's say, 30 seconds. Then, all bets are off.

And I'm talking about ALL media - movies, series, books, music, art... 

Also, this will happen in a way that people won't really notice it. It will most likely start with a Netflix movie or show that will adapt certain parts of the plot to the user, while staying mostly the same for everyone.

So how will a person that is born now into the AI world, will know what they want and like if they only ever interact with the AI. Will it recycle the same ideas over and over again since nobody knows what choices exist outside of the recylced content?

                                <div class="reply-body">I can’t wait to fix some audio and have some made. 

1) remove the vocal distortion in Little Red Corvette. Add in a 1 minute guitar solo mid song.  Add in a 2 minute instrumental opening for a target TRT of 6 minutes. 

2) Billy Eillish featuring Stevie Nicks - duet acoustic version of Birds of a Feather. 

3) remove the obvious edit in Purple Rain that makes the sound become thin towards the end/middle of the song. Keep the entire song HQ with outstanding dynamics and best of best audio quality. 

4) extend opening of hotel California. Make the Tom Tom drums sound better with a closer mic “in room” sound.  Extend end of song instrumental by 30 seconds. 

Etc etc etc</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly, to me this sounds awful. 

I get the appeal in theory, but I watch entertainment because I want to consume ideas that other people had, not because I want to come up with my own or have some algorithm create ideas it thinks will please me. 

For me personally, having media that is tailored directly to my tastes defeats the entire purpose. How am I supposed to learn, grow, and change if I'm never shown ideas that are counter to my preferences?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">btw, for me, personally, this is a game changer. I recently published a very long sci-fi novel (not gonna plug it here...I feel like that's in bad taste), and my DREAM is to see it play out in a film or limited series.

The problem is, Netflix and all other streaming platforms do NOT accept "unsolicited" requests to review consider novels or screenplays. You have to have a literary agent, and I'm having a VERY difficult time getting one!

So once the cost per generation comes down a little, I'm absolutely going to make the movie adaptation...most likely in a limited-series format.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I completely agree. People don't really get how hard it is to get into film. If you're a writer, you have to write these scripts and send them off and pray that somebody will read it and think your ideas are good. Or you go the writer/director route and you have to find $50k in funding to hire a bunch of actors for whatever movie you can make in your backyard, and after you do that 1-3 times you can ask for more money from big studios in order to make real movies.

Making your film in Veo isn't a substitute for real film, but it's great that you can see your ideas come to life for $125/month.</div>

I got 1:08 on murph no vest. In 2018 I got 44 mins with a vest. Hard to believe I’m the same person. Really disappointed, and defeated.

You're older, you're not training as a full time job anymore, your life is probably in a completely different place now than it was 7 years ago.

But I'm gonna play devil's advocate here. In 2019 I did it in 52min w/out vest. I did it this past year w/ vest in 50min. I took a 4 year hiatus 2020-last Nov. due to new job, new house, and 2 kiddos since. Life changes, but we shouldn't sacrifice our health. I've gotten back on track the past 6 months, down 15lbs and getting my strength back. Get back after it! You owe it to yourself and that babe.</div>

Beyond the laughable part of "a=,b=,c,d.." okay but all your questions have E as well bud..

                        <div class="comment-body">That would be hard to say. I use it so extensively in everything I do now. My problem this morning: My wifi dongle died. I have an old one but it's REALLY slow. I have this old Linksys AC router that I had hacked with DD-WRT a couple of years ago sitting in the closet. Asked Gemini if I could connect to it with ethernet and make it a wifi client. Sure enough, it walked me through setting it up and I'm now back up to full speed.

I would have done it on my own, but instead of 10 mins, it would have been a couple of hours digging through web pages trying to figure out exactly how to do it. My life as a computer programmer has been made vastly better by AI in so many ways. Not least of which is that I'm going to find the last 3 years of my job bearable (heading into retirement). I was getting pretty miserable before AI appeared.

Actually writing code has become so tedious and boring. Solving the technical problems is where the fun is. Once I've solved the problem in my head, writing the code is the tedious incarnation of the idea. So much nicer to have AI do it under my direction and not have to do all that tedious typing. I can write a prompt in 1/5 the time and debug the issue and have everything done in less than half the time as before.</div>

When Cooper refuses to debate any knowledgeable person, Rogan says thats just cause he is a shy guy but ya know you really gotta listen to all 45 hours of his podcast to understand. Not sure how Rogan squares that cognitive dissonance.

So Lex is did what Rogan refuses to- invite an actual historian on to provide a substantive response to Cooper's claim that Churchill was the chief villain of WW...</div>

I am looking forward to other games that they will soon compete against each other.  Would be interesting to see how well they could play a competitive Shooter vs each other or even just playing through the game.  They could use the smaller faster models for quick time action, and the reasoning ones when they are out of combat.</div>

An LLM in the pilot seat of a system composed of other neural networks and conventional software are the examples we have of these crude proto-AGI systems, and might be enough to get us to 'real' ones. Our own language centers don't operate our brains and bodies all on their own, they have interconnect junctions with other stuff like vision, motor cortex, memory, etc.

You wouldn't say someone trying to build a better car was cheating by putting a bigger engine in the thing or, by god, *letting it use wheels*. (The spatial mapping tools are definitely analogous to wheels. I really don't know where I'd be without my object recognition layer in my brain telling me what all these dumb raw pixels are. Nor my 3d internal map of my surroundings.)</div>

Another even got 700 HP from supercharging among other modifications ([featured on Hoonigan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBcNqFfr1uw)), so these things are pretty rad and pack some proper potential.

The 3rd gen Lexus LS with the 4.3l V8 due to the bulletproof reputation they have along with being one of the best full sized used Luxury sedans to buy 

Similarly, I can see the W222 (2014-2021) Mercedes S class as being on the same level of recognition of the W140 of old, as they were supremely well made and vastly superior cars to ones after in terms of genuine luxury

Also any 5 cyl Volvo, cause they're absolutely iconic in being unique and cool</div>

The styling, the interior felt so luxurious and well built. I work with cars so I've hopped in basically everything out there. The new S class, and basically all new MB feel so plasticy. Just the steering wheel alone in the last gen was lightyears better than the new one. 

Here's the current steering wheel:

Simple, reliable, fun, practical and affordable. 


Manual versions of these cars are already dying out (see: GTI) and I think in the not-so-far future that manuals are going to be reserved for special edition performance cars only (ie. Porsche 911 GT cars), which will be way out of the reach of the average enthusiast.</div>

They don't want it to end. I think Joe is just reaching an age where he's realizing this won't go on forever... but if it did, that'd be amazing. A lot of people become a little more religious or at least open to the possibility later in life and this doesn't surprise me really.

One thing's for sure though, dude has almost done a complete 180 from who he was just 5 years ago. Kinda wild to watch in real time because I've heard him talk more than any family member in my life lol, multiple times a week</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think "regularly solving problems no human can solve" is too high a standard, because it is unclear how much a human could solve if aided by luck. On the other hand, regularly solving problems no human has yet solved is clearly too weak, as that is what normal researchers do all the time.

I would call an AI a superhuman mathematician if its overall impact on mathematical research matches that of top experts, but across many specialties. Admittedly, that is a bar that is hard to measure, but I think experts in any affected domain will recognise such an AI as quickly as Lee Sedol recognised that AlphaGo was good.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">BlackRock cares so much for the environment, social (*people*), and governance that they force the companies they control to push ESG objectives.

BlackRock believes people are being treated too well by United Healthcare, and is suing them to recoup their investment losses.

In other words, BlackRock has just shown what a scam ESG is!  

**They don't care for people, or the environment, unless it's making them money!**</div>

The “I vibe coded my dream app in 12 hours” posts? Mostly bots or exaggerated founder content. Reddit is flooded with it now. Just be cautious - don’t confuse marketing with actual PMF.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Congrats!

Looks like you’re enjoying Brahmarie Pranayama. 

Look into a few more pranayama techniques, like Kapalbhati, and Nadi Shodhana pranayama. 

These are all great techniques to use prior to Dhyana. It helps to calm the mind.  

Throw in a few customized Asanas, and don’t forget the Mudras.

                        <div class="comment-body">It's probably for a similar reason as image generators having trouble with negative prompts. 

For image generators, the training data consists of images and their descriptions, which rarely includes things NOT present in the image, and therefore the model never learned what absence of something means.

What percentage of videos in a video training data set contains a static image? Probably barely any. There is an extremely high tendency for *something* to happen in a video, otherwise it would be an image.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Image generators suffer from

1. Weak intelligence, which results in inability to understand negative prompts. However, they get better at this as the model improves. Additionally, prompts can be given in the 'negative form' using annotations rather than natural language, which works

2. Training defects. For example, many image models suffer from inability to generate truly dark or bright scenes. Because in their training they are only ever asked to produce gamma-balanced images, ie ones with mixed white and black.

The inability to generate unchanging videos may be due to 2. Maybe in the training process they purged frames that were too similar to each other to remove low-information data.</div>
