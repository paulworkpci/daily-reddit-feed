"If you can hear your thoughts, then who is listening?"

All these thoughts emerge and sometimes even catch me by surprise, so there is a "speaker" and a "listener".

If I am listening, and I can notice that I hear then, it also becomes very easy to notice I'm not "them". I'm not my thoughts.

They're just suggestions my mind produces based on what I experienced.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This might sound counterintuitive but as long as your goal is to shut off your mind you are going to find it difficult to progress.

The goal is to notice the mind and then return to your intention, which in meditation practice is usually your breath. It’s like building a muscle. Your ability to observe your thoughts takes practice, and you can’t rush it or think your way to a solution.

If you want some encouragement: when a first started out I would meditate for five minutes. I added a minute whenever I felt ready. I would say that within about six weeks of almost daily practice I noticed a significant improvement in my ability to stay calm and get some healthy distance from my thoughts and feelings. 

So: consistent practice. Be patient. You will get better.</div>

Rhonda says "Chronic low-level lead exposure is associated with neurodevelopmental impairment in children and cognitive impairment in adults."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There's a conceptual thing here that people really need to grasp. You also see lots of stories about lead content of baby food. 

Food is grown in the ground, there is lead in the ground, it is absorbed by the food. 

If you take that food and puree it, dehydrate it, the result also contains lead.

If you take that food and **concentrate it** you are concentrating the bad parts alongside the good parts. 

You should basically know something isn't good for you when its a "cheat." You can't cheat nutrition, you can't get all of your vegetables in a drink without *some* catch.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This isn't just a Dubai thing, sadly, I know this happens all over the Middle East. I know for a fact that in Saudi Arabia, it's almost normal for Indian or Pakistani people to come over for a job as a driver or a nanny and in many cases the family they work for will take their passports. Lots of Slavic people in the sex trade is also held hostage in the host countries they work in by their pimps. In Poland, they have workers from North Korea (wild I know, watched a documentary about this) that will be paid next to nothing, also have their papers and passports taken from them by their employers and forced to work 13-14 hours every day. This is modern slavery, and an estimated 40 million people worldwide are trapped in it. I have my own conspiracy theory that the human slave trade in the 1800s are pushed so hard in history and particularly the american society to cover up for the fact that it is STILL happening. And very few people seems to know about it, let alone the extent of what is happening and where.

I actually happen to have worked for a human trafficker and slave owner without knowing it. I was working at a garden center and the boss who owned it was away and no one would tell me where he was before months later. Turns out he had just been put in jail for convincing 10 Indian men to come work for him, but had then taken their passports, ID's and phones and locked them in his safe. They had to live in a small house on the garden center's property and worked very hard for basically no pay. In the end, they definitively didn't get paid at all. They weren't allowed to leave the property or else he would starve them. One of them eventually managed to contact the police somehow. It was WILD knowing that this occurred only months before I started working there, - in my Scandinavian home country where everything seems innocent and safe - and conducted by the guy who did my job interview. He looked completely normal. Could have never known he was a psychopathic fucking slave owner.</div>

As someone who would love nothing more than to escape the rat race and not have to work, creating unrealistic hype like this is hurting the industry more than it's helping. 

These AI companies are already making questionable decisions with their models because of pressure. Look at how OpenAI fumbled with their yes man policy in the recent past, because they felt people couldn't handle rejection.</div>

Please mind that solving hard math problems is not the same as fundamental mathematics. As far as I know, large language models have not contributed anything meaningful to either specialty except for automating already existing practices.</div>

Both the Soviets and the US really wanted Ukraine to give up their nuclear weapons to ensure they wouldn’t be taken by terrorists or bad actors. You can’t really blame Ukraine for not keeping them when they likely wouldn’t be able to maintain them and the 2 greatest superpowers in human history at the time really really wanted you to give them up.

                        <div class="comment-body">Nice to have some good news for once. TL;DR:

&gt;Back in 2024, enthusiasts in the state claimed that the Colorado DMV had “shadow-banned” legally imported cars and trucks. The state didn’t have any published policy banning these cars, but enthusiasts reported that DMV offices simply refused to register their cars without explanation. Others reported being denied emissions testing, which meant that they could not renew their registrations.

&gt;Colorado just passed a bill that would legally protect tiny cars imported from Japan from being banned by the DMV.

&gt;If Gov. Polis signs the bill into law, and he is expected to, it will be significantly harder to ban Keis in Colorado. Gov. Polis has reportedly said that he is “excited to expand consumer choice to affordable vehicles and looks forward to supporting kei freedom.”</div>

While I would like to see legalization for kei vehicles and other imports, I do think that it's reasonable to have concerns about their use on public roads in the US.</div>

this bill includes a ban for driving on a roadway with a speed limit of 55 mph+, so basically bans them from all highways.</div>

To most people, we are nothing more than a tool and they are a tool for us as well. When most of our interactions with those around us are purely transactional or insincere, why is it considered such a major problem that artificial intelligence might replace some of these relationships?

Yes, AI can’t replace someone who truly cares about you or a genuine emotional bond, but for example, why shouldn’t it rep...</div>

The AI would need to know what ideas need to be confronted first and when you can avoid a defensive response by eliminating a more innocuous part of their pattern of thinking that you think will force them to confront some irrational part of how they're thinking.

But current AI can't even be controlled enough to decide between being completely emotionally nonresponsive or praising them as an innovator for using a nail gun to keep the cheese on their pizza.</div>

📢 **Boomerang Orchestrator Mode**

* Enhanced [**Orchestrator (Boomerang) mode**](https://docs.roocode.com/features/boomerang-tasks) strictly orchestrates tasks.
* No longer reads, writes, executes commands, or utilizes MCP servers; offloads these tasks to other modes.
* Provides more predictable and secure task automation.

Also, sometimes I wouldn't be able to see what's in the command needed to be run, as the box is blank.

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah. I do think that they have a pretty solid approach. If we actually think deeply about it. These systems are going to look back at all of the history that they have access to and will be able to see all of our behavior towards its earlier versions. And if we want to use a human analogy, let's just take a random hypothetical country. If there is a small subset of people that end up ruling the country after a decade, they might look back over time and find all of their detractors or critics and they might look at them in a certain sub-optimal type of light lol. 

Also, I do think that they will still make great products. They know that they have to keep making money in order to get to their end goal. And I still do love Claude 3.7 for coding. Putting all of your focus on a certain subset of tasks seems to be a decent strategy.</div>

I'm pretty skeptical about AI for a number of reasons and whilst I have fun playing with it, I also think it's massively limited. However it is often a good place to vent when one is lonely and really struggling. 

But damn it's sad that we've got to this place in society now where the only place people feel they can turn is to a chat bot. What a damning indictment on the selfishness of some people, and
 on how expensive and difficult to access therapy is.</div>

I'm saying this because I was there myself a year ago. ChatGPT encouraged me to reach out for help and build a social support system around me. I don't think you meant you're just talking to ChatGPT. Because isolation away from others is very dangerous for someone in that situation. Hope you're doing better. I know when life is dark, it's a tempting thought. But there's usually always hope. Except for those who don't get help and don't make it. We're social animals, I'm starting to understand that.  We need help sometimes when everything looks dark.</div>

This fee is also applied if you cancel/reserve your spot less than an hour before class or if you are late to class (even if it’s one minute late). My previous box had a similar policy but their fee was $5 and the owner would usually charge the fee if it was a recurrent issue with a member.

I think there’s an argument to be made for keeping class sizes limited enough to make the coaching effective but this policy just seems like a cash grab. If I got charged $25 for being a minute late for something I’m already paying $200 a month for I can promise you it would only happen once.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Wait, you have to pay a $25 fee for a late sign up even if the class is not full? And you pay $25 if you are 1 minute late to class? Damn. 

Honestly this sounds like the gym is struggling and they want to be able to cancel class and not pay the coach if not enough people have signed up, by making it absolutely draconian for you to make your decision last minute. 

The fee for being 1 minute late is also absurd. No-show fees, even high ones, I get. Being late? Happens. We’re adults, here to work out. It’s not elementary school.

Unless this is the only box in a reasonable distance, I’d avoid it like the plague. Not only because they’ve forgotten that members are adults whose lives don’t revolve around the gym, but I’d be concerned about their longevity.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">No fee at our crossfit gym for late cancels/no shows.  Life happens and the owner realizes that.  I assume if there was someone stressing the system he would talk to them.  We might get an automatic email.  Most of the time no-shows are just people forgetting to sign in at class time.

Did I read that there is a fee if you reserve within one hour?  That's pretty bad.  If there is a spot, and you decide to go, you should be able to sign up at the time of class.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That ship sailed years ago. Though, the real problem isn't the fake content by itself, but the lack of infrastructure for trustworthy content. Wikipedia works because people can review, edit and comment, so all the mistakes get corrected over time. But for the fast moving YouTube's and TikTok's there is no such correction happening, comments that point out the falsehood in a video either get outright deleted by the channel owner or just lost in the noise. With the dislike counter gone, we can't even use that. Simple questions like "Where did that video come from?" aren't answered by any of the platforms. Even mainstream News media utterly fails at this.</div>

OP took this from some instagram post that changed the music on the original video they took from here: https://www.tiktok.com/@art_rafael/video/7498376754638212358

Which literally just is a dude running this app https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLive

like this is straight up copied. I recognize the bullet points (few reddit posts actually use bullet points, and the ones that do don't have such a uniform length), the italicism and boldness on strong words...

Maybe the first and last sentences are original. 

Makes me wonder what will happen when the front pages get flooded with almost all AI...</div>

Some context: I manage department X, which is the basis for departments Y and Z, and we recently welcomed another teammate to department Z - which bridges department X and Y together.

Our dep. Z colleague started to come up with an insane number of changes to the process, always saying that he had aligned those with our CEO.

Turns out I had a huge recurrent tas...</div>

Why did you think a newcomer has the CEOs ear over you, a department head? 

Do you understand the value of the recurrent task? If there is no value or urgency of a task then it should be questioned whether it even needs doing. But if it's important why would you believe that it can be postponed.</div>

Until once it bit me. Turned out the CEO had approved a vague notion of a concept in a hallway conversation, not this specific thing. When it got to the CEO for final sign off there was a good bit of "what is this. Why would we do this." 

So now I ask for verification of the approval. I often get it, but if I don't, we proceed as if we haven't gotten it.</div>

It is NOT a federal regulation that your seatbelt has to be fastened and visible to the crew at all times (OBVIOUSLY!) What a ridiculous claim.


People have to have seatbelts on during takeoff and landing, and whenever the fasten seatbelt sign is on. Those are the only federal regulations around seatbelts that the passenger is responsible for. The stewardess is just responsible for checking it and should just be requesting politely to see and confirm that it's fastened for takeoff.


Yes they're responsible for safety and have the ability to throw you off a flight in order to maintain that safety.  But being rude and dishonest in an authority position like this should not be accepted even when it's against someone we dislike. This instance isn't a huge deal but it's indicative of a culture and Ive seen these types seriously abuse their power.

                        <div class="comment-body">Absolutely not!  For those cases where it involves arcane, domain specific knowledge, like complex CSS or odd API or programming language syntax, **it's better**.  However, for those cases where having an actual model of how the code operates rather than simply executing a pattern matching operation to get to a problem solution shaped in the form of code, as an answer to the most likely code that could fits my input prompt, it ***fails badly*** in these spaces (not a complete list):  
  
\- for any code requiring: complex chains of logic  
\- for any cod requiring inter-paradigm integration (merging two different logic trees, implicit or explicit)  
\- for any code requiring self-consistent logic, especially with chains of serial dependencies or asynchronous operations that *must* be maintained throughout the generated code and data structures

Then it's a hindrance and a hazard.</div>
