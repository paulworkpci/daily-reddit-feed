                        <div class="comment-body">I started doing CrossFit at 43 and 440 pounds (I've since lost 120 pounds).  While I'm not quite as old, my weight held me back significantly.

My recommendations would be:

1) Don't be afraid to scale. I still am doing ring rows because I can't hang from a pull-up bar yet. Scale volume and technical movements as much as you need so you can learn how to do them without injury.  
2) Recovery is paramount.  There's very little chance of non-elite athletes "overtraining", but if you feel tired, listen to your body.  Push yourself, but know your limits.  
3) Define your goals up front.  If you are doing this for fitness, follow a training program that is appropriate or just do affiliate workouts. If you are wanting to compete, then change your programming accordingly.  
4) Don't be hard on yourself.  One of the pitfalls I fell into early was when I thought I should be at a certain level and failed to complete a workout in the time prescribed even with scaling.  We all have bad days and sometimes we don't scale enough.  Give yourself grace.

I think those are the biggies.  I would also say just have fun.  CrossFit is a super fun thing to do.  If you're not having fun, adjust what you're doing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is fabulous advice! I was kind of on the other end of the spectrum from you. I started at 40 and had a BMI of 17. In CrossFit, I gained 46 pounds (21 kg) in 3 years and am really healthy now, both mentally and physically. Today, I can push press for 3 reps a bar that weighs more than I did when I started CrossFit, which absolutely blows my mind since when I started I was too weak to even front rack the bar and would just use the tiniest little dumbells in all the workouts instead.

It can be slower progress at times if we had a long way to go in whatever sense, but we make progress no matter what. It really is about the scaling and the recovery. Those make all the difference. When I start to be self-critical like thinking I had a really ugly workout because the score wasn't what I thought I could do, I remind myself that nobody is paying me to do this and I got great benefit just from giving it my best.

This connection between Donald Barr and Jeffrey Epstein has been a topic of discussion, particularly in relation to Bill Barr's role as Attorney General during Epstein's legal proceedings, according to Time Magazine.

U.S. Attorney General Barr won't recuse himself from New York case against Epstein: official | Reuters https://share.google/OJBKgieV2m9DZZLoW


 Alexander Acosta, a prominent figure in the legal and political landscape, is known for his role in the Jeffrey Epstein case as the then-U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. 

Here's a breakdown of his involvement:
Plea Deal: In 2008, Acosta approved a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) for Epstein, allowing him to plead guilty to state charges related to prostitution in exchange for avoiding federal prosecution.

Controversy and Criticism: This deal sparked significant controversy, particularly because victims were not notified and a federal judge later ruled it violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act. The Miami Herald reports that this deal "essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein's sex crimes".

Acosta's Defense: Acosta defended his actions, stating that the agreement ensured Epstein faced jail time and was registered as a sex offender. However, this defense was questioned by former prosecutors and victims' advocates.
Department of Justice Review: A Department of Justice review later found that Acosta exercised "poor judgment" in granting the NPA but didn't find evidence of misconduct driven by factors like Epstein's wealth or status.

Resignation as Labor Secretary: Amid public outrage and scrutiny surrounding his handling of the case, Acosta resigned as President Trump's Labor Secretary in July 2019.


Current Status: Acosta is no longer in government, and many of the other individuals involved in the 2008 plea deal have also left their government positions. 

Trump has all these connections to Epstein' and installed people who were involved in not only the sweet deal Epstein got but also all legal matters afterwards 

Trump is the one at the top of the conspiracy I'd reckon maybe he's not that smart but maybe he's one hell of a pimp and I mean that in the worst way possible.</div>

Grok has crazy compute but the LLM architecture is known at this point. Anyone with a lot of compute and engineers can make a Grok. The papers are open to read and leaders like Karpathy have literally explained on YouTube exactly how to make an LLM.

I would expect xAI to continue to reward hack since they have perverse incentives - massaging an ego. The other companies will do the hard work, xAI will stick around but become more irrelevant on this current path.</div>

However the models that were supposed to do well on this is Gemini DeepThink and Grok 4 Heavy. Those are the ones that I want to see results from. 

I also want to see the results from whatever Google has cooked up with AlphaProof, as well as using official IMO graders if possible.</div>

For anyone who doesn't understand, these are not government organizations. They are independent companies. The president nor anyone in the government has any say in how they run their operations. If true AI ever emerges, and the government wants to take control of it, that's one thing, but for now this is the equivalent of Trump telling Burger King they can't sell Impossible burgers anymore because he doesn't like it.

A true declaration of an AI race would be the US government funding their own AI project, not using independent companies to hopefully achieve that goal.</div>

I would say this would probably a pretty good criticism if we were talking about the first Trump term but not this. The EO is going to be tied to government contracts and so that's the lever they're looking to wield. As in telling the DoD or Intelligence community (or whomever) they can't buy an AI product that isn't "politically neutral" by their skewed and self-serving definition.

I haven't seen any details about what this means but I've seen it mentioned that the vendors will have to certify that their products are politically neutral. At which point it's probably not a huge deal. But I read that from a very tertiary source that was itself sourcing a publication sourcing a knowledgeable anonymous source. So grain of salt and all that.

If it's something more than that then I would imagine they will be taken to court.

&gt; this is the equivalent of Trump telling Burger King they can't sell Impossible burgers anymore because he doesn't like it.

Probably more to the point that this would be like saying you're not allowed to research anything that could potentially lead to an impossible burger. Because this just throws up roadblocks because of fully grown adults who never managed to develop a real skillset or learn how manage their emotions.

If you are a fully grown adult and get upset because a chatbot just didn't say your favorite thing then you need to seek professional help.</div>

Ok to be fair, if AI is disagreeing with the user then that's a very big red flag of deliberate bias. 

Not saying it should ideally be like that and not saying you can't use custom behaviors and constant reinforcement against sycophantic behavior to minimize this, but if AI isn't agreeing with you then you should be asking why.</div>

Everywhere is filled with "LLMs will never be AGI" posts. 

It's not like I'm opposed to discussing whether or not LLMs are on the path to AGI, it's a fun subject. But having the same posts with the same standard arguments under almost any topic in the entire AI / machine learning space does get old.</div>

All it took was for reddit liberals to get pissed about art being stolen to completely turn them against all AI. The people who grew up loving science and tech who watched Star Trek and hoped for a technologically advanced future brainwashed into hating AI and "tech bros". Strange though that one article says AI is a stochastic parrot and the next that AI will take all jobs and the same people will dismiss it and the fear it 5 minutes later. The technology subreddit is the worst offender for this and those people have been coming to this sub lately.</div>

Problem is, latex gloves worn for a short period dont quite do as much irritating like a condom during high speed friction for a very brief and. I cant stress this enough, short period of time.

All jokes aside, you can just use Skyn condoms and bypass the whole issue altogether. My advice would be a  better LPT. Just masturbate with a condom on once and see.</div>

HLE and frontier math are important. But today, we see agentic benchmarks as a bigger deal for most people. You'll see more agentic benchmarks going forward.


For most folks, the intelligence is enough on breadth - we need agent capabilities. That means tools, memory/context, modalities. This is a step.</div>

Plus, the GPT models aren‚Äôt that great and popular for coding among the general public when you look at benchmarks like LM Arena and Design Arena. On both benchmarks, Open AI models are outranked by Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet 4, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Deepseek R1.

Why does Open AI lag behind the other model providers so much in terms of coding? </div>

# Codebase Indexing Memory Fix

We've resolved a critical memory leak that was causing crashes when indexing large codebases (thanks daniel-lxs, rxpjd, buck-0x, BenWilles!):

* **Reduced Memory Usage**: Memory consumption drops from \~500MB-1GB to just 10-50MB for large projects
* **Increased File Limit**: Can now index up to 50,000 files (previously 3,000)
* **No More Crashes**: Eliminates...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed. This likely has very little impact on anything besides clickbait headlines.

I highly doubt any manufacturer is going to stop current R&amp;D or change future plans for something that will in all likely hood be changed in 3 years. 

Not to mention manufacturers have been abusing CAFE standard loopholes for decades. Ie- the PT Cruise was considered a truck.</div>
