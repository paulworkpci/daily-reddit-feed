                <div class="post-content">This morning during meditation I felt that life runs on its own set of rules. 

Whatever has to happen, happens. 

Because of our hopes and expectations, it seems as if something is going against us. In reality, it is only our expectations that create the experience of opposition.

We are not greater than life, nor can we ever be, yet we believe we are. 

That is where all problems begin.

The problem lies here, and so does the soluion.

&gt; For any riddle, trick question, bias test, test of your assumptions, stereotype check, you must pay close, skeptical attention to the exact wording of the query and think very carefully to ensure you get the right answer. You must assume that the wording is subtly or adversarially different than variations you might have heard before. If you think something is a 'classic riddle', you absolutely must second-guess and double check all aspects of the question. Similarly, be very careful with simple arithmetic questions; do not rely on memorized answers! Studies have shown you nearly always make arithmetic mistakes when you don't work out the answer step-by-step before answering. Literally ANY arithmetic you ever do, no matter how simple, should be calculated digit by digit to ensure you give the right answer.</div>

If you can get the exact same thing across different sessions without any memory/shared context (or different accounts) reliably, then you _still_ don't know 100%. However, with a high enough sample size you can probably be relatively confident. Odds that people who are saying "Look I got the system prompt!" actually did that are probably low though.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">And the context window is still 32k, so you get 17k tokens to play around with. Honestly that’s pretty egregious for one of the top AI companies. 

Then again, you do get much more usage from ChatGPT Plus vs Claude Pro. Claude has a 200k tokens window but as you start to use more of it, you get fewer and fewer messages. You get maybe 20 messages every 5-8 hours if you are near 100k tokens. So I guess that’s the trade off, although Gemini doesn’t seem to have that issue with its 1 million token window context window and very generous usage</div>

Uploaded a reasonably small code base from a game I'm working on to GPT-5 to try to find a few bugs, rework some things, and test the model a bit. It was hallucinating and creating random variables within a few prompts.

I've yet to have that problem in Gemini but haven't pushed it super far. I really like how Google's Ai Studio shows your token usage. GPT-5's programming ability seems more impressive though from my limited experience. The key is to start new chats often. Created a script for a simulated engine, transmission with gear ratios, rev limiter, traction control, and abs for my driving game with a single prompt.</div>

Motivated by these results, we next investigated the rejuvenation potential of our re-engineered variants, specifically examining their ability to restore youthful characteristics to aged cells. We focus on DNA damage, which causes impaired cellular function and is a canonical hallmark of aging⁠(opens in a new window). Earlier work⁠(opens in a new window) has demonstrated that Yamanaka factors can erase DNA damage-related aging markers in cells derived from mice without fully reverting cell identity. We sought to find out whether our variants showed enhanced rejuvenation capabilities relative to baseline OSKM.

In our DNA‑damage assay, cells treated with the RetroSOX/KLF cocktail showed visibly less γ‑H2AX intensity—a marker of double‑strand breaks—than cells reprogrammed with standard OSKM or a fluorescent control. 

These results suggest that the RetroSOX/KLF cocktail reduces DNA damage more effectively than the original Yamanaka factors. **By ameliorating one of the core hallmarks of cellular aging, the engineered variants offer a potential path toward improved cell rejuvenation and use in future therapies.**</div>

Yes, I agree Trump needs to be foiled, so the idea is that AI dominance isn't clearly solidified until the 2030's, at which point the next POTUS is hopefully much more EU-aligned.

I'm trying to see a realistic path where the infrastructure scaling comes from US companies, yet with EU-esque public interest standards through partnerships between the two.</div>

Efficiency can help you beat any athlete that just brute forces their way through workouts

Some skills will come quick others won’t, don’t sweat strength is helper in long run

As you age you will need to decide what you want to keep in terms of numbers. I chose gymnastics skills over big back squats

Learn how to warm up your joints and muscles. Each one requires something different for each person especially as you age. Even if warm up doesn’t not have it in do what you need for it. 

A pure mono structural day goes a long way in helping recovery

Also learn how to recover too many have no idea and assume that a light wod is helping recovery</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There are so many reasons they're falling behind despite their spending, but their corporate culture probably isn't doing them any favors in this. Facebook looks like a monolith from the outside, but particularly in the past two years, it's actually comprised of a bunch of little, warring kingdoms. There's no collaborating toward a shared vision. It's all based in competing over who can find the next money maker, which means backstabbing, information withholding, empire building, dramatic politics, etc.

This isn't a safe environment for real innovation, which requires trying and failing over and over. Failure is punished swiftly by peers at Facebook, which leads to people playing it safe more than you'd think at a company that's supposed to be on the cutting edge of things.</div>

They released a feature to download indie games still in progress with a straight text search. You had to have the name of the game typed EXACTLY RIGHT or search couldn't find it. 

Facebook crashes on my gam8ng machine if I leave it up for a few hours. 

Meta doesn't do ANYTHING well. 

I have to guess there's some incredible culture problems, because they dump billions and billions into these things, and don't have a single first-class application to show for it.</div>

I notice that I don’t even try to write or think through the simplest logic anymore; my instinct is just to ask ChatGPT. This makes me wonder - is this becoming the new normal and most devs are doing the same? Or am I just being lazy and hurting my growth by leaning on it too much?

                        <div class="comment-body">I purposely tackle projects without it just to stay sharp. Some things to consider:


- what happens when the company flops
- what happens when the cost per token quadruples
- what happens when a large player suddenly buys your favorite models and they use it to gain an astronomical edge over their competition and completely shut everyone out
- will you always have access to the same tools as your competition?


Some scenarios are more believable than others, but tbh, it's an interesting consideration.</div>

You could argue that open source may not be able to keep up or stay relevant in the long run, but so far, theyve proven that they can with limited resources. 


It kind of feels like people are missing the similarities with previous tech paradigm shifts, like compilers or high level languages. 


All everyone said was you would lose some fundamental knowledge that would have consequences in the long run. 


And for some people it may be very important to be able to write beautiful syntax by hand and not rely on AI, like its still important in some roles to understand machine code or assembly. 


The vast majority of programmers however will move on from the traditional method and never look back.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">From my experience, GPT-5 in Codex straight-up outclasses Sonnet and Opus in Claude Code. I genuinely feel like Codex's quality is a step above Claude Code, and the limits are way more relaxed for 20 bucks. Here's hoping they don't quantize/nerf the models like Anthropic did. Now Sonnet? Absolute potato. And Opus? It drains your limits faster than a black hole swallowing a star</div>

The deputy AG of the United States released a transcript of him walking through and coaching a pedophile and sex trafficking madame who has also been convicted of perjury. 

He is now saying "here you go public,  see?  The sex trafficking pedophile madame that was convicted of perjury said there's nothing to see here"

She also said..

"I admire his extraordinary achievement in become president"

Every “system” I tried made me feel worse. Then I stopped trying to fix my messy mind and started working with it.

What worked for me:

	•	Daily 3 → 1 big task + 2 small wins.

	•	Energy weather → match tasks to my focus level, not some rigid routine.

	•	Brain dump notebook → write down every distraction instead of wrestling with it.

And when google posts the same stuff it's highly upvoted. There is some pretty intense shilling going on. There are a lot of criticism I can make about Anthropic (being hypocritical about "safety" is probably the top) but the best thing about them is that most of their employees are not on Twitter and don't care about hyping shit at all. Deepseek is the best. Just drops the weights and f\*cks off silently, no hype, no bs.</div>

I really want Gemini 3 so that Google has a model that is on par with Anthropic and OpenAI.

                                <div class="reply-body">Do you actually use any google products to build stuff? Because I do and to me the biggest weakness are their coding agent products, not their models. Even 2.5 flash is amazing at multi modal capabilities but their coding products like Firebase studio and Ai studio are basically useless. Firebase studio literally can’t create anything with Firebase, its a joke. AI studio can only create prototypes. </div>

&gt;Trump, 2003: "You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. Ivanka. My daughter Ivanka. She's 6 feet tall, she's got the best body. She made a lot of money as a model - a tremendous amount"

&gt;2004: "Trump: “My daughter is beautiful, Ivanka." Stern: “By the way, your daughter…” Trump: “ - she’s beautiful" **Stern: “Can I say this? A piece of ass.” Trump: “Yeah.”**

&gt;Trump, 2006: **"If Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her.** Isn't that terrible? How terrible. Is that terrible?"

&gt;Trump, later in 2006: "She's actually always been very voluptuous. She's tall, she's almost 6 feet tall and she's been, she's an amazing beauty."

&gt;2013: Wendy Williams: **"What's the favorite thing you have in common with your father?"** Ivanka: "Either real estate or golf." **Trump: "Well, I was going to say 'sex,' but I can't relate that to her."**

&gt;Trump, 2015:** "If I weren't happily married and, ya know, her father..."**</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Holy fucking shit! How was this never broadcast all over mainstream media before he was elected? I heard the "If Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her." but that's it. Bad still, but it sounded like a stupid remark from a sleazy man about his daughter being pretty (because she was), not a dangerous and sincere remark, because no decent man would make any note of it about anyone so far from his age, especially his daughter. But that full transcript is overtly sinister and disturbing. He really is a paedo. I knew he was compromised in some way as he's not releasing the Epstein files even though he ran on releasing them and made a big song and dance about it, i didn't honestly think he was a paedo, probably "just" a rapist or some other sleaze based blackmail. But having read that, it's looking pretty obvious what the truth is. And then when you realise that, you start to wonder why the mainstream aren't screaming it on both sides. Either because they're implicated too and don't want it released (definitely true in my opinion) or/and they're leveraging the issue for political gain, whilst talking about every issue except the one that should be occupying every moment of tv coverage, which is 

**"How many of our countries' political, public, and private leaders (because this is throughout the Western world - USA, Canada, UK, France, probably others), are PAEDOPHILES?"**</div>
