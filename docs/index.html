buddy, its BS that Trump cut social services while also increasing the deficit, its fucking appalling that Trump is covering for the guy he used to molest children with.

This is the most insane political scandal in the country's modern history, but i guarantee you they will still vote GOP</div>

*The most compelling idea in Arch-Router isn’t a new neural network architecture; it’s a classic, rock-solid engineering principle:* ***decoupling****.*

*The (model) splits the routing process into two distinct parts:*

1. ***Route Selection:*** *This is the what. The system defines a set of human-readable routing policies using a “Domain-Action Taxonomy.” Think of it as a clear API contract written in plain English. A policy isn’t just intent\_123; it’s a descriptive label like Domain: ‘finance’, Action: ‘analyze\_earnings\_report’. The router’s only job is to match the user’s query to the best-fit policy description.*
2. ***Model Assignment:*** *This is the how. A separate, simple mapping configuration connects each policy to a specific LLM. The finance/analyze\_earnings\_report policy might map to a powerful model like GPT-4o, while a simpler general/greeting policy maps to a faster, cheaper model.*</div>

But as you alluded that there are tasks that are best suited for different models. If you can capture those tasks via a routing policy you get the ability to improve the latency, lower the cost and more craftily define a user experience that would be unique to your app. Model choice is the only free lunch in the LLM development era.</div>

Unfortunately i forget the context but it was shortly after he was on and during Protect Our Parks (i think) he said something along the lines of 'I wasnt going to push back too hard, he has an election to win'. 

Yeah, thats the fucking point. Thats exactly why you should push back. I know hes always been about just having conversations but hes become real comfortable letting people use him to push their agendas.

Edit: It was a Fight Companion episode the day after Trump was on.</div>

assuming someone hasn't asked for advice...

what makes you think you are meant to say anything?

and why are your ideas important to anyone other than you?

                                <div class="reply-body">One of the biggest issues. For something like an AI waifu, you need a model that you can trust. And honestly that means locally. 

Maybe you can laugh at Grok parroting Musk's opinions when you examine its thoughts... but how about when you're in the middle of being seduced? (weird as it is to say)


I think a local model that you can trust, that you know for a fact is 100% loyal *to you* (because you have complete control over it), even if it's slightly less capable, will become very important shortly once more consumers are able to run them locally. They just need to be capable enough to verify any information given to you by more powerful models, and perhaps specifically trained to identify ads and propaganda. 

This will be more important the more misinformation is spread (which AI itself contributes to)</div>

The second group is what they are milking. The same group of people whose dream car starts and ends with a 911, and they wouldn’t consider *anything* else.

And if you bring up how mediocre the base 911 is for the price, those people get very upset because they don’t want to hear that the hero car they yearned for since childhood is now a marketing exercise by Porsche to milk people like them.

I would go as far as to say if you buy a $140k base Carrera, you are paying for a $70k car with the other half paying for the 911 "clout". In fact, I'm not sure if any other OEM can sell something as underwhelming as the base Carrera for $70k.</div>

You're not wrong. I was shopping around for a touring allocation in the US and couldn't find a single one for below 50k over which was my budget. I've finally found one now for 70k over down from the initial 100k over ask. After speccing it, the car is over $375k. That is firmly supercar territory.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think there's a big problem. When a popular chatbot starts recommending piracy sites publicly, the more piracy gets normalized and the more attention gets put on it. Piracy only works if a fraction of people do it. The powers at be know about piracy sites, but they don't care as long as they're not popular because its not worth the effort. But when those sites become popular, that's when they start shutting them down.

But if grok is recommending piracy in general, that puts more attention on piracy as a whole. And the more people are accustomed to piracy as a whole, the more likely a system will be developed to prevent it entirely and ruin it for everyone. Like an actual ID system for the entire Internet, which this administration seems keen on doing.</div>

If nothing else, I think so much OpenAI talent has been poached that they can very quickly start building on what was being developed there, at least the overall framework. They have an **obscene** amount of compute coming online which will help them train more quickly.</div>

And of course any tendencies trained with RL would not necessarily be evident from the prompt. Note that they mention, "A fix to the underlying model is in the works" in regard to the behavior where Grok assumes its beliefs are defined by public remarks from Elon, which would be via RL.</div>

                <div class="post-content">It just takes a little foresight. Pull your meat out of the fridge and generously salt it. Let it come to room temperature and pat it dry before cooking it. Osmosis will draw the water from the meat to the salt, and then re-absorb it. Give it a nice sear until golden brown, and finish it off over indirect heat if you have to. Use a thermometer to know when to pull it out and rest it in foil until final temp. End result is tender, perfectly seasoned meat. Dense cuts like beef can take a dry brine...</div>

[LiveBench](https://livebench.ai/#/)

People seem to get mad at it but, Livebench seems to reflect my real world cases the most accurately. I don't think any individual bench mark will be perfect, so we should look at a bunch. Grok 4 looks similar to Grok 3 release in that in the stuff they show it tested really well but after some use it's about on par with the previous release models. XAI is probably a generation behind most other big players, which is reasonable and makes more sense than they some how blasted past every other leader.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I expected this from my extensive testing. The model is less sycophantic which means a lower lmarena score. It is still very good though. My second favorite model for general purpose questions.

Gemini 2.5 pro is still my favorite model but sadly it is a massive sycophant constantly telling me how great my questions and insights are. I hope they fix that for Gemini 3.

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s not just that it’s less sycophantic, it’s that it has a lot of rough spots relative to other models. Image recognition seems relatively worst, as does tool use via search (defaulting to Twitter is alright for current events, but not ideal for a great many other use cases). 

For code, using it in Cursor lacks a lot of the smoothness of other models - granted that it’s new and likely needs some tuning. The lack of a CLI tool puts it below Claude. It also doesn’t seem to have MCP support as of my last check or much in the way of integrations.</div>

I recently asked both Grok 4 and Gemini what perspectives aboriginal tribes had on homosexuality before Europeans arrived. Gemini gave a generic “they all support” and noted two-spirit, something invented in the 90s. It was a completely empty response and historically inaccurate. 

Grok 4 gave me a table of 10 tribes, the status of homosexuals in each group, and key details about each group. It also noted bias in the data as much was written by Europeans, even referencing scholars names from the past.</div>
