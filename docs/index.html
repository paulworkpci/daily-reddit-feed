Hell, look at METR's recent work -- the time of tasks (mostly software engineering) that AI can complete is doubling every seven months. It's doubling every four months if you just look at the last couple months of AI models. There's *zero* evidence these trends are even slowing down -- benchmarks are saturating faster and faster no matter what they are.

People in other subreddits are too busy squabbling over if it can count the R's in strawberry. People I know in real life barely even know what ChatGPT is beyond "oh that silly chat bot?" It won't be real to them until it comes from their boss in the form of a lay-off notice. This is so bizarre to me???</div>

It's not that they don't have "no idea" but are actively denying it. And I just don't get it.

Whatever your coding forte is... backend or frontend, React or Angular, Python or .NET... doesn't matter. It is time to leave that behind and start thinking about improving your architecture skills and soft skills.

Solution and system design, talking to clients and translating "client-speak" into English and a viable real project, managing your own team (which will consist of a team of agents) will be the future.

Don't be the modern equivalent of the 60-year-old boomer coder who is refusing to do anything cloud related because he still thinks that "cloud is just a fad bro" then gets fired and will never find a new job ever again. The programming subs of Reddit are surprisingly full of those, just AI instead of cloud. It'll be a bloodbath 1-2 years down the road.

But it will not be the fault of AI but your laziness and your "I know it better than actual scientists and experts". I work daily with AI researchers, and I have told people for five years now how to prepare, but even now, basically on the edge of a new digital era, people still find excuses and stupid reasons to do absolutely nothing. Which I don't understand and blows my mind.

Look, even if I'm completely wrong, the worst thing that happens is that you learned some new skills every modern dev should have anyway, oh no. And now think about the worst thing that can happen if you are wrong, and nobody needs people who can only write code anymore.

Sounds like a pretty fucking easy decision, and I can only explain it with some kind of underlying issues of ego and self-confidence if that's still not enough to convince you to save your fucking ass.</div>

For example, add a chart to show expanses in AI field to the chart that shows this progress in task times. And you'll see that they will correlate, as investments are growing exponentially too. The problem is, we cannot double investments every 7 months, cause we will run out of money and resources.</div>

If AI takes jobs fast enough that there's a critical mass of unemployable people (not unemployed! If you wholesale lose your job to AI, chances are those skills you've spent decades accruing are close to worthless. This moves too fast to expect enough people to reskill) at a given time, I can absolutely see that being sufficient impetus to enact things like UBI or negative income tax.

It did that glazing because it was instructed to, and as people showed, it was willing to reduce quality of output to keep glazing the user when the user seemed to pref delusional output. </div>

Regardless, and moreover, your description of it reads very intuitive, but a bit simple relative to the situation.

Leaving that here because the sycophancy problem is, shockingly, much more interesting than most internet memes reduced it to be. Anyone truly interested in the nature of this technology oughtta be following a bit more closely on it than meme level. Not saying you're necessarily doing that here, but enough people are that I figure a callout is worth shoehorning in here.</div>

Now you can mostly skip going to a senior/architect and present them with knowledge or a solution you put together. 

There is no shame in saying, I used LLM to do part of this research, what do you think about this solution during review or knowledge sharing. 

Plus, do we all really remember what we implemented last year? No, you always remember bits and parts and need to review your own code again.</div>

ChatGPT is more capable of explaining what's going on behind the scenes than any software developer.

Are you saying coding will be obsolete next week because AI will do everything?

&gt;Some people love to complexify systems because they love larping as Mr Robot, but I think simplicity is genius.

Simplicity is genius, the ability to reduce complex problems into simple ones is the whole job of a programmer. However reaching genius simplicity requires a deep understanding of the complex systems.

The "simplest" way to code (and which requires only a shallow understanding of your systems) is to create mountains of spaghetti code, which means the simplest way to program is to increase the complexity. Inversely, increasing the simplicity of the system is the complex part. 

Just in case it's not obvious, coding agents aren't nearly close to being able to do that. Which will still be true next week and for decades.</div>

I don't know what they've done to their UI but it is catastrophic. I may cancel my sub for the first time this month. Gemini is that good now. I've been using them together for months but I just can't with ChatGPT's interface anymore. They need to buy T3Chat immediately and slam theirs in.</div>

OpenAI will still stay in the game for a few years based entirely off of momentum, Grok will stay in the game too since Google won't be as uncensored and Elon can't handle losing. Anthropic is screwed because they care about safety too much to make it in the current market. Meta's LLMs are screwed as they get ever more behind SOTA open source models. Deepseek and Alibaba will gain marketshare worldwide and eventually get so good that Western companies will call for safety-focused regulations to ban them, which will in turn be hampered by the fact that Chinese companies have been releasing the full weights of their models. 

Various European, Korean and Japanese companies will continue looking like they'll come out with something that's SOTA but it's always going to be a few years behind and their best talent will leave for better opportunities elsewhere. Every moderately-sized nation on the planet will come out with some half-assed LLM that they'll try to use to try to mitigate bureaucracy but so many shitshows will commence that eventually most places will opt for a Chinese or American alternative.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm worried about coupling the "AI coding agent" with the "AI model".

Atm we have 2 healthy ecosystem categories:

1. AI coding agents. Cline, Roo, Aider, Kilo Code (disclaimer: I'm a maintainer for Kilo Code), you name it. They all have TONS of WEEKLY releases (better integration, workflows, etc.) 90+% of them (at least the popular ones) are 100% free and open source. 

2. AI models. We see 2-3 of those every single week. They're getting cheaper and better.

These 2 categories work in a nice way where we get more features, faster, for cheap/free (local models are also getting more popular nowadays).

Acquisitions like these heavily bias this dynamic. I can't help but think that Windsurf will start favoring OpenAI models over others (like Gemini/Claude) which could inevitably lead to its downfall.

Time will tell.</div>

I don't mind paying for what works. If you're a paid tool and you allow more models into that otherwise closed ecosystem then they should be equally as good at the job or or just don't bring them online.</div>

This is a very good time to sneak in with the OpenAI name which is just as strong as GitHub right now and capture the lions share of the enterprise market by being significantly better than Copilot is right now. 

Not to mention that as the model provider, it’s in their best interest to maximize caching capabilities and server-side codebase indexing along with heavily subsidizing API costs as “marketing spend” in early years while building market share that will pay itself off when prices inevitably decrease.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt; It was always meant to be low-volume production but orders as of the end of last year were only in the dozens.

&gt; First customer deliveries of the Celestiq are expected by midyear, according to the company, which declined to disclose how many orders it has received for the car.

&gt; If successful, it could create a new two-unit business model for the company: one focused on hand-built, high-end vehicles and the other on mass-produced models.

I think they’ve done a good job with the rest of the lineup but I really don’t understand the celestiq. Sure you can customize it however which way you want, but only where they let you. 

Can’t have anything interesting on the dash unlike rolls or a bentley. Rear infotainment is still tacked on in any config. The tech looks like it’s out of an escalade half the price. The styling is derivative. And apparently it is not nearly as comfy as it could be

they’ve managed to launch a car 75k over a v12 maybach and that car is already arguably awful value</div>

I feel like I could vibe code a Cursor clone, using Cursor, and have it come out better than any of the competitors currently have.

like, why can't any of these tools just read the terminal and automatically iterate on an error? why do I have to copy-paste the error and have it fix it? why not just have it run a check itself and look for faults? makes no sense.

                                <div class="reply-body">Gotta say it’s more than that. Yes they get an IDE on the quick, but just as much or even more value is the data feedback loop coming from the IDE’s users. This can give insight around where the ai succeeds, where it fails, and user responses are now training data. Other advantages is it gives OpenAI an entry point into a users workflow where it can start providing direct value that only open ai can provide. The advent of ides like cursor and windsurf was starting a path that could potentially commoditize ai behind someone else’s user interface. This gives open ai ownership of another set of customers and actually a place to hook in their $10k ai engineers. I suspect this will pay off.</div>

Not sure when it happened exactly, but I’ve basically stopped Googling error messages, syntax questions, or random “how do I…” issues. I just ask AI and move on.
It’s faster, sure but it also makes me wonder how much I’m missing by not browsing Stack Overflow threads or reading docs as much.

                                <div class="reply-body">That's the golden answer. When there is a clear and common way to do things, it shines. If you can tell it exactly how to do something, it will usually do it well. But if it requires special framework knowledge, or some level of architecture design, it will likely flail and require you to reorganize the code manually, or write it yourself to save yourself the pain of a super detailed request over and over again.</div>

I vibe-coded a maze generator over the weekend and (re)learned  depth first search, advanced SVG DOM manipulation, parameterized optimization strategies, and finally wrapped my head around management of IIFE's (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) barely writing a line of code.

The Carnivore diet isn't something I'd recommend you do indefinitely, but it is excellent in that it eliminates a ton of bad shit people eat. Plus since your carb intake is extremely low, you can potentially lose weight more easily than you would if you strictly counted your portions.</div>

If you work somewhere long enough you can tell who is cool and who isn’t. I met someone at my first proper job who I remained friends with after and we even travelled together. We’re not as close anymore but…

I think it’s possible but rare to find someone who isn’t a snake. 

All that family stuff is generally a big lie. Most of these people don’t even like each other.

Edit: I just shamefully remembered I have another ex colleague who I’m friends with and we meet up every now and then. Shoutout to her, can’t leave her out.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The problem with a slow burn is that small disruptions in the economy can have large cascading effects

For example, we wouldn’t need to lay off 25% of the American workforce before it starts collapsing. AI, taking the simple jobs in and of itself is enough to collapse the economy.

I like to think of the analogy of self driving cars. Once we get to the point where an intelligent system is able to drive all cars and control traffic, you won’t have a job for a car to take you to. Our whole ideas about property, protection, employment is going to be drastically changed in the next few years.

I suspect the system will collapse, and we will all be fighting in the streets for scraps of food within 10 years. The only way out of this would be a government legislation that is both proactive about mitigating risk, and working towards UBI to ensure humanities access to services. Neither of those things are happening in the next few years. Our government is reactive, and they will wait until shit hits the fan.

Buckle up, things are going to get real bad. Don’t have kids, don’t make any major financial decisions, pay off your debts, and stock up on rice and beans.</div>

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley\_fern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern)

Gemini code:

// Base Barnsley Fern IFS (Iterated Function System) parameters

const baseFunctions = \[ ...

{ a: 0,    b: 0,     c: 0,     d: 0.16,  e: 0, f: 0,    probability: 0.01 }, // Stem

{ a: 0.85, b: 0.04,  c: -0.04, d: 0.85,  e: 0, f: 1.60, probability: 0.85 }, // Smaller leaflets

These parameters in the Gemini code are identical to those on the Wikipedia page, which were in turn taken from the 1988 book.</div>

I usually would go to the noon class because it was down the street from my job, but now that I have my kids half the time I can’t justify leaving work for 1.5 hours when I can’t make up the time staying late or leaving early. The weeks I don’t have them, I’m usually traveling.

Maybe your mental health will improve now you're divorced, but if I were you I'd consider taking the time and sticking with it. If this is a tough time for you then seeing your gym friends every week will help</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">being tired does make you more lucid. it's an interesting time to meditate for sure.

I used to do a bunch of psychedelics, and have had times where just from being tired, I felt almost like i was tripping on shrooms. very trippy

cool experience you had!</div>
