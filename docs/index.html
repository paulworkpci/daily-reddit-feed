The rich are already taking all they can from the poorer and the only leverage poor had is that rich needed their work/money. But now, they don't even need a good chunk of their work - they just need them for manual labor. And with many people needing jobs, the salary of those jobs would go down, and the poor become even poorer. 

Really surprised to see this many people thinking that the government will take care of their needs, when most government in fact do not give a crap about you. Just look at the housing market crisis. They are collectively doing nothing because it benefits the people in government with real estates.</div>

By learning about the history of technology. Automation/technology in general has historically *always* been met with concern and opposition (literally going back to antiquity), yet it always has led to more value for humans. In fact, historically we have made ourselves redundant several times over by increasing the output of labour with technology and automation in different sectors.</div>

Full Interview - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FcbPQoVXJs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FcbPQoVXJs)

Irish scientist Dr Colm Kelleher has developed an interesting theory after studying these anomalous crafts involved in incursions that appear like drones and planes:

[https://sundayworld.com/news/irish-news/irish-scientist-with-top-secret-us-government-clearance-explains-why-we-are-not-alone/a215160076.html](https://sundayworld.com/news/irish-news/irish-scientist-with-top-secret-us-government-clearance-explains-why-we-are-not-alone/a215160076.html)

&gt;***“Brightly lit and silent. After the first ten we thought it has to be an advanced tech Special Access Programme by the Air Force. But the pilots were taking enormous risks over populated neighbourhoods with experimental craft?“***

&gt;***After 100 cases we concluded they were not US Air Force. Pilots were violating all safety features. It was decided the phenomenon was mimicking SAPs. We created a hypothesis: ‘bi-directional mimicry’ where the phenomenon was reflecting back to us what our advanced SAPs were doing.***

The idea that the UFO phenomenon is able to mimic our technology goes back. In 2003 Jacques Vallee and Eric Davis wrote a paper suggesting the same thing:

[https://thedebrief.org/where-the-second-uap-disclosure-act-failure-may-now-steer-the-ark-of-human-history/](https://thedebrief.org/where-the-second-uap-disclosure-act-failure-may-now-steer-the-ark-of-human-history/)

&gt;***“UAP visiting Earth would find it necessary to hide themselves from our detection mechanisms until they have assessed our technological layer or potential threat and hazards. They would employ an adaptive multi-layer risk program to avoid danger. Low observable stealth such as simple camouflage through mimicry, which works well in nature, may be the technique of choice for visiting UAP experienced in surveillance.***

&gt;***Examples of mimicry techniques are UAP entering the atmosphere with either the look or trajectory of a meteor or hidden within a meteor shower, behaving like dark meteors without the associated optical signature, hiding within an artificial or natural cloud or a satellite re-entry, behaving as pseudo-stars sitting stationary over certain regions, or mimicking man-made aircraft’s aggregate features.”***

Back to Dr. Kelleher:

[https://www.rdrnews.com/opinion/columnists/drones-mimicry-and-deception-oh-my/article\_3227e326-b41a-11ef-beba-635327989fc3.html](https://www.rdrnews.com/opinion/columnists/drones-mimicry-and-deception-oh-my/article_3227e326-b41a-11ef-beba-635327989fc3.html)

&gt;***The phenomenon itself appears to mimic human technology. This bidirectional deception, where UAP disguise themselves as human-made drones, creates profound confusion. As Dr. Kelleher explains, investigators face two layers of obfuscation: one from human secrecy and another from the phenomenon’s inherent trickery.***

Irish scientist Dr Colm Kelleher has developed an interesting theory after studying these anomalous crafts involved in incursions that appear like drones and planes:

[https://sundayworld.com/news/irish-news/irish-scientist-with-top-secret-us-government-clearance-explains-why-we-are-not-alone/a215160076.html](https://sundayworld.com/news/irish-news/irish-scientist-with-top-secret-us-government-clearance-explains-why-we-are-not-alone/a215160076.html)

&gt;***“Brightly lit and silent. After the first ten we thought it has to be an advanced tech Special Access Programme by the Air Force. But the pilots were taking enormous risks over populated neighbourhoods with experimental craft?“***

&gt;***After 100 cases we concluded they were not US Air Force. Pilots were violating all safety features. It was decided the phenomenon was mimicking SAPs. We created a hypothesis: ‘bi-directional mimicry’ where the phenomenon was reflecting back to us what our advanced SAPs were doing.***

The idea that the UFO phenomenon is able to mimic our technology goes back. In 2003 Jacques Vallee and Eric Davis wrote a paper suggesting the same thing:

[https://thedebrief.org/where-the-second-uap-disclosure-act-failure-may-now-steer-the-ark-of-human-history/](https://thedebrief.org/where-the-second-uap-disclosure-act-failure-may-now-steer-the-ark-of-human-history/)

&gt;***“UAP visiting Earth would find it necessary to hide themselves from our detection mechanisms until they have assessed our technological layer or potential threat and hazards. They would employ an adaptive multi-layer risk program to avoid danger. Low observable stealth such as simple camouflage through mimicry, which works well in nature, may be the technique of choice for visiting UAP experienced in surveillance.***

&gt;***Examples of mimicry techniques are UAP entering the atmosphere with either the look or trajectory of a meteor or hidden within a meteor shower, behaving like dark meteors without the associated optical signature, hiding within an artificial or natural cloud or a satellite re-entry, behaving as pseudo-stars sitting stationary over certain regions, or mimicking man-made aircraft’s aggregate features.”***

Back to Dr. Kelleher:

[https://www.rdrnews.com/opinion/columnists/drones-mimicry-and-deception-oh-my/article\_3227e326-b41a-11ef-beba-635327989fc3.html](https://www.rdrnews.com/opinion/columnists/drones-mimicry-and-deception-oh-my/article_3227e326-b41a-11ef-beba-635327989fc3.html)

&gt;***The phenomenon itself appears to mimic human technology. This bidirectional deception, where UAP disguise themselves as human-made drones, creates profound confusion. As Dr. Kelleher explains, investigators face two layers of obfuscation: one from human secrecy and another from the phenomenon’s inherent trickery.***</div>

I am hopeful but it sounds fishy.

edit: I guess it's because they lack the lab equipment to carry out the experiments themselves, but I feel like they'd still want their hand in these sorts of developments, maybe by leasing lab space or hiring 3rd party workers.</div>

And to your edit, true...but couldn't they just buy a lab company? Like some company that is doing this work, buy them, then do as you say.

Waiting for a scientist or someone to correct me/us on this, as I have no idea how this area works.

When your nervous system is fried, your brain just wants to get through the day. Not grow. Not create. Just survive.

Fixing that changed everything.  
More than any planner, timer, or morning routine ever did.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">you have to start making hard decisions that most people don't want to make.  If you are having money problems then you need to get a better job and/or do without.  Like instead of fast food eat beans and rice until you dig out.  If you are having problems with people then you need to start setting hard boundaries.  If that does not work then cutting off people is the next step.  In my experience, that long term play is hard for most people so they get stuck.  Also, cutting off someone toxic like your parents or someone in your family is really hard to do.</div>

It's a super important reminder that sometimes the most "productive" thing you can do is actually address the underlying stress and give yourself permission to just... be, until you're out of survival mode. Glad you figured out what was really going on! Hope you're finding more space to breathe now.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I had this realization a couple weeks ago when I was feeling overwhelmed with all my different responsibilities that I thought being more organized would help me. I thought maybe having extra support or a different system would "fix" it. I learned very quickly that I can't fix my systems when I keep adding to my to do list/drowning. It was really uncomfortable to detach from the idea that I needed to make a drastic change to feel in control, but I just needed to take a breath and focus on what's right in front of me. Truly just doing what you can each day and also recognizing your need for rest. It takes a lot of work to cut through the overwhelm of everything you know you need to do and just focus on actually doing the work you need to do - which always sounds easier than it is, but sometimes we make things more complicated than they actually are.</div>

They’ve already begun detaining non-citizens who engage in anti-genocide protests. If you think they’re not coming after citizens next you’re a clown. 

This is one of the ways they launder attacks on citizens and their first amendment rights. If they can say it’s not real, it’s not organic, they’re paid by outside agitators, etc, it doesn’t read as contradictory to all the self-described free speech warriors on the right. Hell, look at how a lot of these freeze peach guys react to just the act of protest on social media. The Soros angle is just how they justify their contradictory views.

It’s building up to be read as just the government protecting our nation from an outside agitators (Soros) who want to destabilize our country and rig elections. It’s not much of a stretch using this narrative to start saying that protestors are terrorists. 

The “Hamas supporter” angle on a wide scale only really works for brown people and immigrants. This might be one of the ways they justify locking up or deporting US citizens.

This is all speculation. They might be even dumber and bolder than I’m giving them credit for.</div>

Both sides parrot this claim when they are unable to understand the other side. To these people, the left seems so out of touch with motives so inexplicable the only possible explanation is that someone must be paying them because, to him, no one could possibly be that stupid.</div>

It's that each generation is too computationally costly for the output - which can possibly be very random, like a slots machine. You can give it a really good prompt depicting exactly what you want to happen, but then you hit Generate and PRAY it generate precisely what you want to happen, or else your credit is completely wasted on something nonsensical. Especially when it involves multiple entities interacting like an epic sword fight or wrestling match on a mat. 100% characters go morphy and wibbly wobbly like a messy blob of mud.</div>

It seemed like Optimus-alpha was superior, though — hopefully we get some info on that, too.


edit: can they just keep the name Quasar Alpha? That sounds way cooler than the current naming schemes.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don't know, but my guess would be the amount of data produced when it comes to text vs image/videos making things hard to scale. The compute cost is crazy.  
  
I know image/video (image sequence) models aren't necessarily "token based" but when a transformer based neural net produces tokens there are just few of these tokens and the file size containing that text is usually super small. But when we make images or videos, the file size is huge and the amount of tokens that need to be produce dramatically increases, even with a very efficient tokenizer.  
  
Increasing the size of the model with the shear amount of data outputted at inference makes it hard when you have an AI that has finished training but also during training, because you also need to do inference during training in order to know how close the model's test output is to the expected output and then adjust the weights of it's neurons based on that difference.  
  
I guess that's why the image generators of GPT-4o and Gemini take quite a bit of time.  
And that's just 1 image, if you want a 5 seconds image sequence, you multiply that already more expensive process by quite a lot.</div>
