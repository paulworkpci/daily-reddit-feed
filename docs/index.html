When the only real way to know how to feel is to see the product/feature/service whatever, in action and sometimes even that's not enough and you need to actually engage with it in order to appreciate if it's any good.


It's like an announcement for the announcement of a trailer being posted.

                                <div class="reply-body">The point of vague posting is marketing. It's all just marketing. Open AI does it and seemingly everybody can't stop thinking about what they have upcoming when they do. Endless speculation means they own the mind share of people thinking about them as opposed to others.

It's basically free, too. Just have some employees with an AI following post a few emojis or a short sentence or two at scheduled times.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's a great video. I really like some of the podcasters from the Rogan verse on individual levels. For instance I find Theo very relatable with coke ( I love partying) and Akash reminds me a younger Russel Peters with his crowd work and race specific jokes.  But the boys all together are definitely profiting off the current political landscape and they definitely know better but sold their souls for the bag. 

I'm taking a break from podcasts and listening to audiobooks.</div>

The best part of this whole story is Maron has just uncovered an amazing line of jokes for all comedians to start going after these little piss baby comedians.  

Their right wing leanings is like the least rock-n-roll edgy shit a comedian could do.  

No cool celebs go maga, its just the washed up has been losers like Dean Cain, and Scott Baio.</div>

But people are a product of their environment. Chances are Rampage was belittled by a family member growing up, too. For Rampage, that's just an example of normal and accepted child rearing. Sad for everyone involved.</div>

While their parents are still youngish (middle aged and up), everyone should ask them how they plan to support themselves after retirement  — finances, residence, lifestyle. Vague answers, denials, or resistance are red flags. Put them on the spot to have an answer (in a kind and loving, but insistent, way)...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Over the years my mom (widowed) was the rare type of person who is blunt and open to any topics, so over the years we had several discussions about her plans. We knew financially she was Ok, but when she turned 80ish there were conflicts. 

We had a hard time getting my mom to give up driving. We had a family intervention and took her keys but assured her we would either drive her or arrange transportation. She was furious but submissive under so much pressure — facing 3 grown children and 5 grandchildren  who weren’t backing down.

And we had to insist that she move out of her house to an ALF, which she resisted vigorously (she had lived in it 40+ years). All of the family helped her clear out the house, haul junk, organize her belongings, and get moved, and she ended up loving her new place, thankfully. 

 I’m fortunate bc my mom planned well and was a careful manager of her money. As an army widow and full-time nurse, she had generous income and she saved / invested over the years, so when she retired there were no financial burdens, fortunately.  She gave my sister (an accountant) power of attorney and that was a reliable safeguard over her finances.

Overall, our family was lucky / blessed with a shrewd and responsible mother and we didn’t feel burdened when she became less independent (although inconvenienced at times). She died at age 90.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm blessed to have a mom who very openly discusses aging. 


My biggest advise is that framing the topics of aging appropriately is key:


- Overall: the greatest gift a parent can make a child (beyond life) is openly discussing end of life. It's scary and sad but it's inevitable. I find that pointing to friends (ideally of the parents) who struggle with aging parents, lack of preparation, emotional abuse (dementia is mean) etc helps make the case for why it's a gift to talk about again now.


- Start from worst case rather than current state: it's much harder for a parent to think about giving up something they have now (way they live, driving, health) than to engage on "I hope this never happens but there's a significant chance it does and if it does would you rather....". 
Example: Living will -&gt; ideally you or me never have a stroke or accident but if we do, the EMTs/ Docs are going to try to save our lives (no one looks for a living will while it's an emergency) and only if they succeed to keep us alive but without being able to express our will (vegetative state) are they going to look at the living will. Now do you want to be rececitated at all cost that you are already in a vegetative state (because if you can talk, you can express your will and thus living will does not matter). Point is, it frames the whole conversation properly. The choice is not live or die. The choice is live in a state that is not what you have now (no communication, maybe less perception of your surroundings, etc) or die.
The same is true for nursing homes: The choice is not living at home or at a nursing home, it's if you have to live in a nursing home, do you want the nice one or the not nice one. Ah the nice one, we'll let's get you on the wait list just in case.


- Appreciation: Make sure to give your parent a compliment for being courageous in dealing with the topic.


- Not me vs you but what can I do for you and what can you do for me. 
Example: I would never come at financial matters through the lens of "dad, if we don't talk about this I may be on the hook for money I don't have just to take care of you.", instead it's "dad you took care of me for a long time. I want to be there for you and I know you want to help me and my family as well. Let's think through the worse case that aging doesn't go as planned and you need professional assistance day to day. That way we can see how I can help if the time comes and to what extend you can may not require our financial help."</div>

After sitting down and talking about the specifics, they had to adjust their plans a bit and are now living very comfortably and independently.

We also had to get their wills updated and discussed advanced directives.

There were arguments and tears and raised voices at times, but in the end there's no ambiguity for how things will be handled going forward.</div>

( i have integrated like 28 exercises)

still early but the camera tracking works pretty well. reps get counted automaticall...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A wide range but 10-50hrs depending on the person and what they go for IMO.

For more competitive people [speedruns are around 1-2 hours on red/blue.](https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnredblue?h=Any_Glitchless-eng&amp;x=wk6oork1-38dyy180.013xmnx1)

That being said it's not fully comparable time-wise since the LLMs have a lot of delay processing instructions and waiting on feedback/navigating through menus. I'd imagine a good approximation of the time it might take an LLM without those built-in delays would be closer to half or less of what is seen.</div>

Just upload an image and write an accurate prompt for it.

When you use it it's usually quite a bit slower than what I showed here, but then you can download a video of the footage you made and it's smooth.

Google's engine is much better than this, because it remembers parts of the world even when you're not looking at them (you can see in my videos that objects keep shifting and changing, even the characters) but it's not available to the public yet. This is free and fun to play around with. I think of it as a small demo of what we'll be able to do with Google's Genie model.</div>

Serious response: why don't you take a breath, skim over it's question and ignore the text. It's really not hard, you're expecting to see it, scroll past like it's an ad on reddit. It's easier surely than getting annoyed at it... 

Sometimes it's suggestions are excellent next steps and I reply with a "that would be really useful thanks, can you also..." expand on and improve it's ideas and it'll help improve how you express your prompts.</div>

"Really? I bought mine. They sell 'em at K-Mart for 3 bucks."

"He died in Korea for that flag!"

"Wow, what a coincidence. Mine was made in Korea."

No one—and I repeat, no one—has ever died for a flag. See, a flag is just a piece of cloth. They may have died for freedom, which is also the freedom...to burn the fuckin' flag.

                                <div class="reply-body">Very useful when you need help with an excel formula. You can ask it to write a formula and tell it where the data is in terms of rows/columns/cells. Very handy if like me you often forget the name of a function or just can’t be bothered working out which function to use or how to use a specific formula for a not that important use case. I find it very time efficient.

Always check what it does is correct though, obviously.</div>

"When BYD announced that it had actually pulled this off with some of its latest EVs, the development made headlines all over the world. It's called Megawatt charging because it delivers 1,000 kilowatts of electrical power at 1,000 volts, which is twice as powerful as the fastest chargers we have here in the United States. And BYD claims its new electric sedan, the Han L, can gain almost 250 miles (400 kilometers) of range in just five minutes with this setup.

I almost didn't believe it. So while I was in China for the Shanghai Auto Show, I knew I had to see it for myself. And after a flight to Beijing for a technical briefing and demonstration, to which InsideEVs was the sole Western outlet invited, I can confirm that five-minute fast-charging is very real."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If you do the math, the cars averaged around 137mph with stops included... They would've covered an average of ~3300 miles every 24 hours, which is comparable to the record distance of Le Mans (3360 mi). That's actually incredible for EVs, especially considering that they were actually recharging and not just ripping out the whole battery and shoving in a new one. Granted, I'd assume they weren't braking and accelerating / using as much total energy for those miles as they would at Le Mans.

When Formula E launched about a decade ago, they had to jump out of the cars and hop into spares midway through the race because they couldn't cover the full distance. This looks like a huge step up in practicality.</div>

But credit where it's due, those distances and speeds are very impressive. Now put it in a sexier body style. (Yes I'm being delusional; the gran coupé is the only BMW 8 series body style not being immediately discontinued, which suggests it sells better than the coupé and convertible.)</div>

I started doing this as a joke, but stuck with it for a month. Before bed, I’d set a timer for 60 seconds and just laugh. At first it was fake, but within 20 seconds it always turned real.

Weird results:

I fell asleep faster (like my brain didn’t hold onto stress as much).

I woke up in a lighter mood.

During the day, I caught myself laughing more easily at small things.

                        <div class="comment-body">I had a similar experience with a fussy baby on an airplane. I had booked a first class seat on a red eye from LA to Newark and when I got to my seat I realized that I was next to a woman with a baby. Not an infant, but definitely under 2. The baby didn’t have a seat, so she was obviously meant to sit on her mother’s lap and this kid was NOT having it. Fussing, wiggling, kicking her feet, etc. 

My first thought was “you have GOT to be kidding me, I cannot believe I paid for first class only to be sat next to a fussy baby!” I am not generally a rude person so I wouldn’t have said anything or made a scene but I was fuming internally. I looked around to see if it was worth asking a flight attendant quietly if there was another seat I could move to but looking at the cabin it didn’t seem likely. 

And then I saw the woman’s face and I could tell that this was not her idea of a good time either. In that moment I realized that this was happening whether I liked it or not and the only control I had in the situation was how I responded to it. I’m a mom also, my kids are older now but I remembered how hard it was sometimes.

So I introduced myself to her, asked her friendly questions about the baby (how old, what’s her name, etc) and then told her to please let me know if I could help her with anything to make the flight easier and I made the decision that no matter what happened I would treat her with empathy and not be a jerk about it. 

And about 20 minutes into the flight the baby fell asleep against her mother’s chest and didn’t make a peep until we landed. So if I had been rude or passive aggressive it would’ve been for nothing.</div>

Because as a mom travelling with my kid I always worry about how he is going to disturb the flight, and me stressing gets him worked up. So I work on showing calmness myself, but by showing that Mom that you weren't going to act annoyed helped her calm herself and her son. 100%</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This reminds me of a time when I was younger and slept outside on a warm night, on a hilltop under a clear sky during a meteor shower.  As the night progressed I would be visited by hungry mosquitoes and I realized I wouldn’t be getting much sleep for all the swatting I let doing around my exposed head and neck.  I took a similar approach and tried to be accepting and observe the sensation of the flies landing and in some cases biting.  Like your description, it really did shift my perspective enough to calm my body and after a bit of time being the observer, was able to fall asleep.  

Also only got 2 or 3 bites that night.  And the meteor shower was amazing :)</div>
