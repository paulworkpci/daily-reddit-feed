She wasn’t terrible - although she had a specific thesis behind center right podcasters having a sway on their audience.  She’s not incorrect, but center left comedians do the same fucking thing, and Tim validated that counter point with great examples.  I felt it was a great conversation and should definitely be had more often with other polarizing YouTubers and podcasters.</div>

I also would like that add that Tim made a couple of really good points that need to be considered, because it’s kind of annoying to hear this interviewer try to get Tim to explain this comedian podcast sphere that helped get Trump elected.

The point she was trying to get out of that conversation was so frustrating because she was ignoring that

1) Kamala Harris was massively unpopular and she was inserted into the presidential nomination because Biden wouldn’t drop the fuck out of the race. So people in the left were not energized and certainly not people who were undecided voters.

2) people like Tim Walz, and Bernie sanders were invited on the podcast and they couldn’t make it. So what the hell are they supposed to do? Left politicians were not getting out there and defending their platform. Especially Kamala. She didn’t do her first interview for weeks and the first one she did she had Walz holding her hand.

This is so much more about the democratic establishment not knowing how to deliver for their voters and adequately communicate their message to the masses, NOT some right wing podcasters having on Trump and Vance.</div>

What I think we're close to is this being usable, through many  generations, to make full media. As in, you have a story planned (by you or an LLM), and you generate hundreds of clips that you mash together.  

Basically, each generation is a thoroughly described scene. Perhaps akin to movie scripts. The AI needs a few more features to get there though, namely character and scene consistency.  

It should be capable enough that you can describe a scene and a character once, and then call that value in further scripts and clips.</div>

Think about it, whatever we do unwillingly becomes our personal hell. But when we do the same thing willingly, it can feel like heaven. It’s all about attitude. That simple shift from resentment to acceptance can transform your experience.

&gt;*It's dark because you are trying too hard. Lightly child, lightly. Learn to do everything lightly. Yes, feel lightly even though you're feeling deeply.*

This has been my saving grace. Just do things as lightly without resistance.

If they are chores, add music. Its helped me to handle chores that I would never do in a week.</div>

I have to wash the dishes -&gt; I will wash the dishes

I have to file my taxes -&gt; I will file my taxes

This simple shift in wording makes a world of difference. Instead of feeling like shit or guilty about having to do something but not having it done yet, you just admit to yourself you're going to do it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Let me respond with a conspiracy theory:
The real conflict is class conflict. Wealthy power vs. all. Now, by dividing the lower classes on the basis of race, the poor blame each other for their exploitation and the resentment never generally trickles up to where it belongs. In other words, the race war is a mechanism for controlling the vast majority of upper-middle, middle and poor classes in the U.S. 

Media is a deception that perpetuates the narrative and thus the great unwashed (as they are termed by the rich) never revolt and never complain. Or if they do complain it’s directed at the target racial group to resent.</div>

Everyone should read that again.  And spoiler alert: Reddit with all its ‘moderation’ is also the media that’s lying to you.  That is the most heavily moderated subs.  So all of the big/main ones.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Depends man, Ive lived in the US most my life, Australia on 2 different occasions (multiple years) in two different major cities, im actually a permanent resident.  Sydney was just like any other large city in the world, but had no issues making friends where i hear it can be hard in places like NY or SF.

That said, they are a lot less politically correct but in a way that is just ok and accepted and it didnt feel like people were walking on eggshells all the time.  It was nice, I actually was going to live there permanently and become a citizen...then i came home for a bit, met a girl, and unfortunately never made it back.  Id take Australia any day though over the US from my experience.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I am genuinely struggling to think of an event that could conceivably be more American than this. Several identical sausage-shaped novelty trucks, courtesy of a sausage brand, race around a gigantic oval track for the entertainment of hundreds of thousands of people who will then watch dozens of racecars spend hours turning left at breakneck speeds. Maybe if a dude wearing a flag cape jumped them on a Harley afterwards while a bomber flew overhead, that'd do it.

Nothing against NASCAR or the Indy, but only in America could they, and this, ever exist.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’m curious about the USAMO numbers.

The scores for OpenAI are from MathArena.  But on MathArena, 2.5-pro gets a 24.4%, not 34.5%.

48% is stunning. But it does beg the question if they are comparing like for like here

MathArena does multiple runs and you get penalized if you solve the problem on one run but miss it on another.  I wonder if they are reporting their best run and then the averaged run for OpenAI.</div>

I can request and generate 3 versions of my new feature faster in Aider (and for 1/10th the token cost) than it takes to make one change with Roo Code. And the quality, even with the same models, is higher in Aider.

Anybody else have a similar experience with Aider? Or was it negative for some reason?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I try to tell that people all the time. You will save cost and increase quality in comparison to tools like roo code or cline. It's only a little bit like driving a manual car (takes a little bit longer to learn in comparison to Cursor/Windsurf, roo) because you have to give it files+directories to look at for context (which is actually a sort of prompt optimisation if you think about it, at the end it enforces better quality output). There is one/two cases where I cannot recommend it: If you don't know a large code base structure or the code base is not git based then it's not a good tool to use. Maybe that MCP is not on the roadmap for future too (but that's a future problem for me and forks like aider-desk are looking at this, have not tested that one yet).

Take a weekend off and learn aider chat (+ openrouter) and learn how to configure it with env files. I deeply recommend to RTFM and look at their official documentation. Commands like /ask, /save, /load will make your life easier.

The reward will be that you can always switch models (even local ones) and upgrade models relatively fast if there is anything better and you keep your cost down with the best quality combined.

I love aider and it's my number one AI assistant coder (especially in architect/editor mode), best quality, most efficient.</div>

Google’s biggest issue is that when people think of them, they think first of what their search engine has turned into lately and they think “how could a company that turned into this be the future of technology”</div>

Google was *always* going to win the race because the battle is fought on the computing scale and Google creates more AI processing power with their TPUs every years than all of the rest of the AI industry combined. It doesn't matter how smart the people are at other AI labs, google can just throw an order of magnitude more hardware at the problem, even with inefficient algorithms and outperform you.

That said the moment RL became a big factor in LLMs was when DeepMind would absolutely dominate. They have the best talent in RL and it's not even close.

So Google has the "winning trifecta" of best talent, best hardware and most capital to throw at the problem.</div>

Not because they're a great exercise, but because it's so accessible. You can do a dead hang anywhere. This exercise is also really accessible for almost everybody because you can get to the 6 minutes at your own pace. If you can only hang for 5 seconds, you'll just get back at it. Requires very little motivation. I personally like hanging on my staircase.

                        <div class="comment-body">Unreal. I woke up this morning in a lot of pain with my back. Literally just read this and decided to hang from the underside of the fire escape stairs at the back of the office. 

As soon as I had my weight on my hands I felt a strong POP in my left shoulder and thought I’d just dislocated the damn thing. I immediately got down and my back feels soooooooo much better! 

I’m still in a bit of shock tbh. I hadn’t felt anything off with my shoulder before and it’s fine now but the instant relief from my back is so so nice. Still a bit tender but I’m no longer worried about needing to go home early to lay down for the rest of the day. 

Thanks a million OP!</div>

Literally brought me to tears. I had been in so much pain.</div>

Naturally, I sprint to the nearest playground like a man possessed. Shirtless. In dress shoes. I jump onto the monkey bars with the grace of a dying walrus and immediately feel a *cosmic realignment*. My vertebrae made a noise like a zipper being undone by the universe itself.

My vision went white. When I came to, I was floating six inches off the ground. My chronic back pain? Gone. My taxes? Filed. My ex? Texted an apology. The stock market? Up 12%.

I’m not saying this cured my sciatica, but I’m now legally classified as a suspension bridge. Thank you OP, you’ve singlehandedly unshackled humanity from the tyranny of gravity.</div>

I think dead hangs are great for posture and stretching but acting like they are super accessible is not all that accurate (making special trips to the park is not super convenient unless you’re already going to the park)</div>

The AI:

* Scanned all the science.
* Figured out a plan.
* Even wrote the code and ran simulations on Azure HPC.
* Crunched what usually takes YEARS of R&amp;D into basically hours/days.

But here’s the insane part: **They didn't just simulate it. They actually WENT AND SYNTHESIZE...</div>

What really blows my mind is peoples inability to see how technology doesn’t start in its final form and will continually progress. 

People swore it would never replace actual coders and now we are about to have a full on game studio of AI agents running under my command to build whatever I want. And that’s just for pleasure, think of the medical/science this will be doing.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I recently lost a lot of weight. I had been working out consistently for 5 months and the weight wasn’t going anywhere (I was stuck between 185-190).

I moved recently and dropped 20lbs (I was kinda worried that I was sick) even though I stopped working out in the new environment. I was waking up early just like in my previous environment, eating more at home/preparing my own food just like before but I really think being somewhere where I had way less stress &amp; around ppl I trusted was the biggest factor. My weight has been consistently at 162 for about a month, no going up 5lbs or down. I even began to eat out a few more days than I did in the previous place, still at 162. So I definitely do believe it matters how you feel when you eat.</div>

They have gone NUTS with banning people who were previously flaired but skeptical of anything Trump is doing, and the sub was never great but is a parody of what it was even a year ago now.

Dont take my word for it though, go look at their recent threads on the ashley babbit settlement, then go look at threads from even just 2 months ago;

It went from the majority of comments lamenting on the fact that she would get any sort of settlement, to literally every comment supporting her and most calling for the cop who shot her to be jailed.

There have been weekly "BAN THE FAKE CONSERVATIVES" posts in there for a while and it seems they've cordoned off a nice section of whats either bots or the dumbest people online (its bots though)</div>

"he uighur death camps in china literally started out as national healthcare. Socialized medicine is literally just genocide.

They are literally walking around advocating death camps and making it mandatory for you."</div>

A lot of good stuff out there. FreeCodeCamp is also great. I’m a big fan of books, but that’s been better after I gained some experience. I believe I started seriously learning with the Head First books of HTML/CSS and JavaScript using notepad.</div>

I literally asked Claude about Speculative Decoding after watching GosuCoder's video on it - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIP-ZZHm--Q

And it gave this beautiful artifact with ELI5 explanation: https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/e2100ef0-8f1a-4115-aa8a-dfe26b0682c2

The prompt was simple:

&gt; Generate an ELI5 diagram in React that shows how speculative decoding works. Let's say we have a draft model named Qwen 2.5 Coder 0.5B and a main model Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B.

Now imagine doing that for coding. Learning becomes so fucking easy.</div>
