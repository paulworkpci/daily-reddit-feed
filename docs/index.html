                <div class="post-content">Even today, ads is the vast majority of Google's revenue.  It is their bread and butter. Not just search ads, but also display ads on the web. As more people use AI to answer simple questions it is going to lead to less search revenue. But also less display revenue because they won't be visiting websites that have ads on them.  Google can try to put ads into Gemini, but then users will simply flock to whatever LLM doesn't use ads.  I see dark times ahead for them.</div>

I'd anticipate at least an update on project Astra (infinite context windows), their new google glass devices, and something major in medicine. that 10 or so % will shed right off.

plus it's not like ads are going to churn much business right now anyway. people for the large part aren't buying crap right now.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The issue isn't who's better at AI , it's how will Google preserve its cash cow , because AI (at least the models the way they are now) **removes the need to click through a bunch of links to find the nugget of info** you need .. but it'sprecisely the clicking through links that gives Google its revenue...  You can easily display sponsored ads to the right of AI answers but no one will ever likely click on them if they find the info they need . In the answer 

Plus Google isn't just competing with one or another domestic search provider but likely a dozen AI companies that will stand up similar products</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Ask yourself where that ad spend is going to go instead. Chatbots haven't attempted to monetize ads because its not simple to do so. Hence OpenAI going with a subscription based service. So I wouldn't assume Google is doomed. Third party websites will still show ads. Google provides that service. Android apps will still show ads. Google provides that service. YouTube will still show ads. Search will still show ads and Search serves a different use case than a chatbot. The most monetized searches are the ones looking for a link to a website to buy something or pay for a service. Chatbots are used more for research and writing and coding.

If there were an obvious outlet for ad spend to go to other than websites, search, apps, video streaming then I would be more worried.</div>

These AI LLMs are way too expensive to give for Free. Or even for a subscription. Unless you make limits, or put high subscription costs, it will be hard to scale profitably. 

I *think* that Altman said something similar when they announced they are not becoming a For-Profit and will be a PBC. He said something about not having enough compute or something. 

Either way. Ads will come to AI LLMs. And when it does, Google will be ready with everything.</div>

Google is very well positioned to integrate ads into their AI offerings, but it will be much harder to have a monopoly. At least OpenAI is a strong contender, but not the only one.</div>

It doesn't mean they are doomed Google has many other ways to make more money like GCP, but traditional search use going down is not good for Google. </div>

This helps especially if your alarm goes off before the sun comes up because it's an obvious signal. It also has the added bonus that there's no easy snooze button involved.

With a light, you don't need to look at your phone or a clock. It's not meant to wake you up, but to be a signal that fills the entire room. You can even see it with your eyes closed.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I remember hearing about Mark Zuckerberg designing a bedside clock for his wife that only displayed the time if it was after a certain time in the morning, and before a certain time in the evening, obviously. So then if she woke in the early hours she wasn’t thinking “oh, the alarm is going to go off in 30min”, and then couldn’t get back to sleep; she could just roll over and go back to sleep. I don’t want to support Zuckerberg, but it honestly sounded like a great invention.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'd get too stressed not knowing how much time I have left to sleep.  Is it 6 hours or 30 minutes? 

Also sometimes I'm just randomly wide awake.  If it's like 2 hours before I'm to be up, I'll try to force myself back to sleep.  An hour and a half left though? I might as well just get up and do something.

But, maybe I'm not quite wide awake.  In that case, I'll go back to sleep at an hour left, but get up if it was under 30 minutes. 

TLDR: A partial clock just isn't for me.</div>

In short, it's a Highly Customizable AI Research Agent but connected to your personal external sources search engines (Tavily, LinkUp), Slack, Linear, Notion, YouTube, GitHub, and more coming soon.

I'll keep this short—here are a few highlights of SurfSense:

Essays require deeper thought on a topic and logical progression of thought. They tend to be "homework" type work because we don't put all those pieces together on the fly (at least not to any deep level). By using AI to avoid writing essays, students are dodging one of the more meaningful ways of learning.</div>

There is nothing wrong with using composition as an educational tool. There is a problem when learners can’t be bothered to do the work. At the university level, that’s on the student.</div>

It really depends on the data. I highly doubt reddit is selling data that can just be scraped. They likely have a lot of other data they include like comment/post views, interactions and time spent, reports, policy warnings, user data about who upvotes what content and what content those users create, marketing and bot content, distribution of views over time etc. </div>

Real talk. 99% of all Corvettes (all generations) that I've seen in my life did not have a passenger in the seat. I'm not joking. I don't know what it is about Corvettes or their owners, but they never have passengers.

It has caught me off guard the few times that I *do* see a passenger.

I recall being at a truck stop gas station in the middle of nowhere and parking next to a Corvette being occupied by a couple probably aged 60+. They looked to be in the middle of a long road trip. The wife had a "Fuck. This. Shit." expression written all over her face. She was *not* happy to be riding in that car for so long.</div>

I might be different from the rest of this subreddit, I think having dozens of buttons everywhere is just too confusing and doesnt look nice, this is much better than just a long row of random buttons.</div>

it makes it far easier to catch any small changes you might need to make to adapt the code, compared to trying to catch them later when you are reviewing.

I found it a good practice then, and I think it's well applied to code generated by AI.</div>

I've started feeling more emotional outside of meditation, crying more, feeling anxiety more and also more feelings of joy and love.

Keep going!


My experience was that one day during meditation I realized I had no internal dialogue and was simply staring at a wall. it also made me laugh. It was very much like I was getting a cosmic joke and the joke was on us/me. Exactly how I described what it was like.


You are not losing your mind but continuing meditation is certainly changing your conscious awareness. Please keep going with your regular hourly practice.</div>

Questioning the building blocks of reality like self, time, awareness and 'thing' will cause dramatic shifts in perception and understanding of our experience from a subjective phenomenological perspective. So yes it's very normal.</div>
