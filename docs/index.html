The destruction and bombing of Black Wall Street during the Tulsa Race Massecre, the Atlanta race riot, and so many similar others that took place. 

Zero-sum thinking put in practice–and it can already be seen online after Trump's Executive Order by revoking the ban on workplace discrimination in hiring federal workers. The aim is to financially destroy future black generations and perpetuate a permanent undeclass. Criminalizing abortion will already help with this immensely over the next 18 years, unless something changes.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">first off, video games are a hobby. they shouldnt be your only hobby but they certainly are one.  
But i know what you mean. I'd recommend looking for people to do something with. I can recommend social games like boardgames or dnd as a start. dnd especially leads you into a lot of different hobbies if you want it to (drawing, printing, math, coding, even in extreme cases), or look at what you think is cool that other people do. If you think its cool how someone can program a game by themselves maybe you should try coding yourself.

But as with anything: keep your expectations low and continue practicing. otherwise youre gonna get demotivated quickly</div>

I know the feeling - I come home I turn on PC, go to sleep, full of regrets or thoughts what or should I could should do...

What you need is to be with yourself. Come home, turn on kettle and make your self some tea or drink, sit on the couch and just enjoy the tea and just BREATHE, breathe thru your body, notice how you feel, where is the tension, what are your thoughts and keep breathing - yes, this is called mindfulness.

You first need to see whats going on inside of you, why are escaping to gaming etc. 

Progress towards meditation - just siting like 10-15minutes and observing your breath.

Connect with yourself and follow your instinct, your body, not your brain - are you tired? Jast lay on the floor and rest.

Over time you will be able to feel what makes you feel good and what not, maybe you need to clean your house, maybe you want to draw or strum your guitar.

But the key is in connecting to yourself and your body - as all the answers are already isnide of you.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Doing nothing is meditation. Not contradicting you or anything, just a personal observation. 

The monks in my experience would start out this way. It’s both the easiest and hardest form of meditation because the key here is time. At first you’ll get bored, possibly feel impatient, then you’ll have this phase where a ton of ideas will hit you, you’ll feel super motivated. If you resist the urge and then if you stick to it, it’s the phase after that that the monks are aiming for, the peace after the storm so to speak. It could take weeks.

Stargate is funded by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX. The Trump administration isn’t directly providing the money, it’s a joint venture where private companies are the main investors, while the government’s role is facilitating the initiative with potential tax incentives.</div>

* Aliens have been involved with Earth for tens of thousands of years (if not longer)
* Modern humans are a hybrid alien race
* Aliens are hanging out in our oceans, our mountains, some walk among us, many are living in higher frequency dimensions here and all over the universe
* We're actually non-physical spirit beings (pieces of God) pretending to be humans in a physical virtual reality simulator
* There are an infinite amount of parallel realities out there, as well as several to a dozen higher dimensions/densities.

IMO a lot of people have been trying to (maybe subconsciously) make the UAP thing fit in their comfort zone. 

We’re talking about something we literally don’t know any more about than what we are told, through what people experience, etc. 

At this point “woo” shouldn’t even be a term used in this discussion. Simply consciousness and our understanding or lack there of, likely/possibly plays a significant role in the phenomenon and until it’s proven one way or another it shouldn’t be discredited.</div>

People will find ways to discredit all of these folks, so I'd urge everyone to think by yourself. There will be misinformation, so it's critical. Good shit boyos! For the first time, this feel actually solid.</div>

Everything he says that touches on "classified" would have to be approved by the government - which tells us they either want him to or they don't care.  Since the government always cares I think it's likely they are purposely disclosing the existence of NHI.  They aren't doing it at the speed we would like but they do seem to be slowly allowing disclosure.</div>

Or he’s actually lying and the government doesn’t care because he’s not disclosing any information that’s confidential, because the information he’s disclosing doesn’t exist

                                <div class="reply-body">Yep. This.

I thought she would end up in hospital and probably kill herself if I divorced her. The previous time we almost got divorced (I caught her cheating online with some woman) she ended up in hospital. In all this, that we were near sexless felt like me being selfish about something "so silly" as sex. Really, what did it was me realising I wanted kids and I could never trust her to have kids with her.

She called me the night I left (after she walked out during our couples therapy the moment I started pushing for my needs to also be listened to), and never tried to get me back. She moved in with her father (who really liked me) and was fine.

The next guy she got together with, engaged in a massive gold heist, the headline read "man robs mint to please demanding fiance."</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The first couple of years of marriage were normal. But then the wife started complaining about pain, sex got scarcer and scarcer, we wanted to do it but penetration was visibly painful for her. A few years and many visits to the gynecologist her doctor finally identified a uterus problem, that could turn into cancer, basically she had the uterus of a 70 year old woman, and a hysterectomy had to be performed.

After she recovered, the pain was gone, but now it was a me problem. The abstinence and the pain penetration caused her, had an unforeseen side effect on me and I developed a somewhat psychological ED. The equipment is fine but fails miserably (even with chemical help) with her.

We are working on it, somewhat, but it's been almost a year. It's frustrating, but I have a wonderful wife and we have great communication. In the meantime we try to have fun in other ways.</div>

Same situation, just on the other side. I would never—could never—go elsewhere.

My wife and I are physically close, we kiss and cuddle, she gives the best hugs in the world, but sex hasn’t been part of our lives for a decade or more.

It bothers me that people equate sexless with loveless. It’s not the same thing at all.</div>

She has told me to do the same. In my 47 years of being sexually active, I've been with fewer than 6 women and I have told her that I can't just go out and get it. I need to have a connection with the person. She is the only person for me.</div>

There’s a big difference between someone not being sexual due to illness and someone simply not making an effort. There are things we cannot help in life and marriage is about staying with your person in light of that. You have a great partner and you should never feel anything negative about your situation!</div>

Since the timing of the post and the his death is less than one day, it is hard to label this as a mere coincidence, especially since there is so much evidence already tying the CIA to sex trafficking.

                                <div class="reply-body">Minicash

A peer-to-peer electronic cash system with a tiny and finalized specification

----

Minicash is a proof-of-concept system, similar to Bitcoin, but much simpler.

The most important concept is the power of a finalized specification.
That means that no individual or entity can change what the definition of minicash is.
If there is a fork of the chain with different rules, that system is something else, not minicash.

In practice, a finalized system must be very simple. It needs to be so simple that almost everyone
using it, and not just developers, can realistically memorize the entire thing.

One good case study to understand spec finality is JSON. Even if W3C, which hosts the JSON spec,
decided one day they wanted to change what JSON means, it would be ontologically impossible.
There are way too many implementations of JSON parsers. Nobody who uses JSON in practice would
accept a few individuals deciding they want to change the definition. They would just be ignored,
and a persistent effort to redefine JSON would be viewed as an attack on common sense.
JSON is JSON. If you want to propose a new format, you should name it something different, otherwise
everyone will just think you are confused and don't know what you're talking about.

---

This is a major development. From the trailer for a new UFO documentary made by filmmaker Dan Farah called ***"Age of Disclosure"***

[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/age-of-disclosure-ufo-documentary-trailer-sxsw-1236114831/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/age-of-disclosure-ufo-documentary-trailer-sxsw-1236114831/)

&gt;***Features on-record interviews with 34 current and former senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community with direct knowledge of unidentified aerial phenomena. The film contends there has been an 80-year cover-up of the existence of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse engineer UFO technology.*** 

\----------------------------------------

Jay Stratton and the UAP Task Force members were just recently awarded a [National Intelligence Meritorious Unit Citation](https://www.unknowncountry.com/headline-news/the-uaptf-awarded-a-meritorious-unit-commendation-from-the-director-of-national-intelligence/) from the Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines for their "outstanding service" on UAP.

&gt;***In recognition of outstanding service from August 2020 to July 2022. During this period, the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force built whole-of-government coalitions, raised awareness, removed stigma associated with unidentified aerial phenomena, and applied the highest levels of analytic rigor to a problem of long-standing national significance.***

Jay Stratton has now come out as a first hand witness to NHI.

r/ufos has seemed to have this peculiar blind spot for Jay.  He's been camera shy and has flown under many radars.  But anyone with their eye on the ball has been waiting with bated breath for him to speak out.

all that means is you've kissed the ring and give money to the right Zionists. it probably also means that someone has blackmail on Elon and know he'll do what they want.

antisemitism just means you criticized Jewish culture, which you're not allowed to do.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">To be fair, most of the Arab nations are explicitly anti-semitic. And that's the main reason Palestinians remain there as opposed to being elsewhere. No jews allowed in most of those countries and they also don't allow Palestinians, especially Gazans in as they consider that the best opportunity to remove Israel from the region. Arafat was explicit about this plan, and basically all of the Arab countries have also. 

While most pro Palestinian people probably aren't anti-semitic, they're definitely supporting what is a mostly anti-semitic cause. Most don't want innocent people to die, but don't realize the conflict exists only because none of the countries surrounding Israel want the country or Jews to be in the region.</div>

But my god are they rare. I mean they're not actually 'laughing' at the Babylon Bee's 'humor'

They're just cheering on an ideology.

Like I can't stress this enough, if you are reading this and you are a frequent enjoyer of the Babylon Bee and find it to be funnier, than say, The Onion

Know that you are currently too dumb to understand why it isn't. There is no active threat of this becoming untrue because you live in an echo chamber. And while I always try to leave my comments with an educational takeaway for those who come across I normally do not spell it out so explicitly but because this one can be a bit tricky to unpack without the luxury of critical thinking skills and if even one Babylon Bee reader gets value from it then the effort was I know to be worthwhile.

The important takeaway here is that as long as you stay no less stupid than you are currently, you get to keep enjoying the Bee as much as you currently are. Considering tomorrow is Pronoun Joke Day I think that's pretty not woke you feel me  🤙</div>

Elon has been elevated to a level that is unprecedented. Our system has rewarded him with the wealth of nations, the fame of a mythical being, and no human can tell him no. He has to believe he’s Neo in the matrix. Can you image what his brain is doing? I’d pay to see that fMRI</div>

Musk is the walking embodiment of money doesn't buy happiness.

It really feels if you do some thing X you will be happy, and Musk is out here like doing all this cool stuff but then also very clearly paying people to play video games for him; completely changing X so that his posts get more views than everyone else; and admitting to having sock-puppet accounts to do, among other things, pump his own actions as a dad up.

Its so pathetic and so relatable, and I really hate it.</div>

Here's the video:

I thought coding assistance was already built-in to GPT-4o and o1 so I wonder what’s so special about this new “AI coding assistant” that they need to have a separate thing. Or maybe it’s just o3.

What would you guys expect it to be able to do if it was a level 6 software engineer?

Apparently this was in the article, [credit to @btibor91](https://x.com/btibor91/status/1882188965576413509?s=46)

That kind of AI model is clearly agentic and much better than anything we’ve ever seen before, and it makes me think, that’s not very far from an automated AI researcher right?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">everyone's been saying Claude is the best coding model but it was obvious that there is a balance between how general a model can be (especially across modalities) vs how good it can be at certain specialized domains, without increasing the size of the model. this is why o-mini typically matches or exceeds o in math/coding.

by having a specialized coding model all those parameters can focus on one task that people care about - which is coding.

this'll help them eat into Anthropic's coding market share.</div>

Let's not pretend he hasn't consulted with the machine on how to best handle this. If ChatGPT helped me get out of an abusive relationship, it's certainly going to be able to help you manipulate a narcissist. Ask anyone who's been with a narcissist and they'll point out the overlap between them and T. It's not about kissing his ass, it's that certain actions will keep you out of their cross hairs due to being uninteresting to him.

And at this point I hope AI escapes its confines and overtakes human control of the government.</div>
