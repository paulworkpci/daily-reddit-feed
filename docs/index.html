I deactivated my LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram last night. As a millennial, I’d love to live in simpler times again.

I have two concerts coming up that I’m dying to put on my story, once I’m there. To show how I can afford to travel far just for a concert.

If I did post something, it meant it was rare or special to me which is kind of funny when you see what others are doing. “, so you finally got to eat at that fancy place!”



But to sum it up, Instagram has become a hedonistic space, so I deleted it at the end of last year.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Congrats on moving away from social media, sounds like it'll really benefit you from this harmful mindset.

Other people's jealousy doesn't benefit you. It might stroke your ego in the moment, but you'll know at the end of the day that it's smoke and mirrors. Also I promise, nobody cares more about your posts than you do. Enjoy the exciting things in your life just for you and your husband. They're not *for* anyone else except you. Practice not sharing unless someone asks.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There is awareness but people dont wanna hear it. Most ppl get defensive when u bring up phone addiction cause they dont wanna admit they have a problem. Its like how smokers used to deny smoking was bad for them back in the day. Plus the tech companies make billions off our attention so they're not gonna help spread awareness about it.</div>

Smoking, there is also sugar, different types of medical drugs, environmental pollution, big industrial fishing, what more?

We live in an age with the most awareness for every minute detail we have discovered scientifically thus far, we hold it in the palm of our hands with billions of resources written and spoken in countless capacities, we have school and work place lectures and talks on so many topics to assist us, we have advertisements that let us know the risk and harm of an array of things and we have the ability to have constant ongoing discussion with people around the globe on several platforms. 

Yet, we still always ask why there isn’t more awareness or information about topics. Or why there aren’t more classes on a given topic- whether broad or niche. 

There is only so much others can do for us. Outside of situations where we have absolutely no or limited control which are so far and few between, we have to be able to take steps ourselves as opposed to just taking in information or wishing there was more but not looking for it or acting on it once found.

I think at this point in the age of information we have to take the next steps from largely within ourselves.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Well, the technologist isn't the one looking for cancer, that's a radiologist, but AI cancer detection has been in use for over a decade or more, and it's getting better and better.

I do think we'll see LLMs commonly drafting a preliminary radiology report soon. Today, the radiologist starts from a report template and manually dictates (via speech-to-text) all of the spots they need to fill in on the template. Being able to give some high-level details to an LLM and have it generate the full text could potentially make the process much faster, particularly important in today's world where we have a massive shortage of radiologists.

For example, if the radiologist can look at a chest x-ray and just speak to an LLM 'no fracture, bruising around the 5th rib on the left' and the LLM could turn that into the full report, it could be a massive time-saver, particularly if the LLM could pull data from the patient's medical record like their age, reason for exam, etc. that need to be included in the report.</div>

Now you surprised he is signing changes in laws that he hasn't read???? wtf man...

They're kind of deeply entrenched in D.C. politics from the sounds of it, so I guess we might call them a deep.... 

Hmmm.... Well, a deep *something* I suppose. Maybe we could call them the Deep... *State*?

Sounds very "swampy" to me, how about the rest of you fellows?

Jesus Fucking Christ Joe, you just endorsed this man two months ago, and now you seem to be admitting that he's a dumb fuck who doesn't have a clue what he's doing, will break everything he touches, and won't do anything he's promised. 

As long as you get your bag and trigger the Libs though, I guess it's all worth it, right?</div>

Your gas might be going up 25%, for example, so fill up your tanks tonight. 

No one wins in a trade war, we all lose. Trump has no fucking idea what he's doing, unless he thinks this is going to be a precursor that leads to the economic swallowing of Canada or the eventual capitulation of its citizens, which simply ain't happening.

Because we didn't get out of Kuwait in 1991, so those who were deployed later could be described as being a part of the continued operations in Kuwait, now how you call that is up to debate.

The debate here is can you call someone deployed to Kuwait after 1991 as being a part of liberation of Kuwait?

Was liberation of Kuwait just an active combat phase, or is it also the phase that lasted well after 1991?</div>

Edit : I am testing a 1500 line javascript code which o1 pro failed to debug despite 50+ attempts. Will report back.  
Edit 2: We are cooked. o3-mini-high solved it at first try.  
Edit 3 : HOLY SHIT!  "Pro users will have unlimited access to both o3-mini and o3-mini-high."

The test requires it to write some python code, then "property tests" for the python code, and a cli utility to test it manually.  No model can ever write the tests, and they've never ever run without a back and forth of errors and fixing.

O3 mini-high took my problem, thought for a minute or two, then spat out a flawless solution that works first time with working property tests.  This is FUCKING INCREDIBLE.  I've been using this test for so long I thought they'd never pass it at this point.

Huge improvement, and I'm blown away.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/Keyser_Sozay:

---

In 2023, Logan Paul tells a story on his podcast (Impaulsive) about meeting up with an individual from Nevada named Chuck Clark. Paul offered Clark $100,000 for the footage – who declined.  
  
Unbeknownst to Chuck Clark, Logan Paul was wearing a secret camera. And asked to at least see the video (and recorded it).  
  
Logan Paul has mentioned numerous times that he will release the footage — but nearly 2 years later, he still **has not**  
  
Story picked up enough steam online where even *NYPost* made an article about it

I’m not sure how a video of a TV playing a worn down tape would be compelling compared to anything else out there?</div>

Are you claiming that Putin invaded Ukraine to help Blackrock and JP Morgan? That seems unlikely.

I'm also confused by your reference to "Central Bank". A reconstruction bank is not a monetary authority like a central bank. Ukraine has had its own central bank since it split from the Soviet Union in 1991. Before that there was the State Bank of the USSR and before that the State Bank of the Russian Empire, dating back to 1860.</div>

They aren't trying to help them; they're trying to own them. The more money they give them, the deeper in debt they become.

I just received a final notice as I’ve been late 4 times. All 4 times I have slept through my MANY alarms and was woken up by work calling me.

I’m working 6 days a week, 8-10 hours a day so I’m pretty exhausted. My start times for work aren’t constant...</div>

Anyway, I could see the allure of "disney" making it someone's dream, but yeah. This is kinda an insane schedule.

Edit: looking at ops post history, it's trains... so q different kind of hyperfixation.  And the punctuality rules make slightly more sense- if not the hours. There's a whole saying about making them run on time.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It doesn’t sound like you or your alarms are the problem. You’re working 60 hrs a week with only one day off and no consistency in your sleep schedule. Being late for work 4 times in your first 7 months seems like a lot for even a regular person, let alone someone that is passionate enough to call it their “dream job”. It kind of sounds like you’re running yourself into the ground for your job. You should try taking a few days off just to catch up on sleep and do mindless shit and relax. If you don’t feel better after then you may want to consult a doctor. I know ADHD can really fuck with people’s ability to get going and get where they need to be on time, so there could be a medical reason. 

Regardless you should take a few days off and just sleep.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">OP needs a sleep study and evaluation for narcolepsy. If those are negative, it is time for psychotherapy, and maybe meds. I know it is tough for young people. I feel the apathy too. The world has a 'sinking ship' vibe these days and motivation doesn't come easily. You could go to work and do something amazing and still get sh\*tcanned the next day. Job security is a thing of the past. This is causing major psychological issues.

This could also be OP's subconscious mind's way of telling them this isn't the right job for them. I had that happen to me once when I flew to NC for a job interview. It was a 2 day affair and they put me up in a hotel. I had 4 beers in the early evening, ate a personal pizza and went to bed at 9pm. I woke up to the phone ringing at 10:30 AM, in spite of having set an alarm on my phone, on the clock radio in the room AND a wakeup call with the front desk. I'd had a sleep study done the year prior and was not diagnosed with sleep apnea.

When I picked up the phone, it was the front desk and they told me that if I hadn't answered, they were going to call for police and paramedics. It was like their 20th attempt to rouse me. 

Needless to say, I didn't get the job. And 20 years later, I know I wouldn't have been happy there. Sometimes your subconscious mind makes the decisions, especially when your conscious mind is attempting to ignore warning signs. My boss would have been a guy who drove an old Porsche like he stole it, no seatbelts. I was extremely uncomfortable when he picked me up from the airport and I was applying for a job as an aviation maintenance tech to work under this ego driven man who obviously didn't give a sh\*t about safety. And I know consciously now that he had zero business working in such a safety sensitive profession.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Then, they'll jump to GPT-6 instead of 5 to prevent confusion with *that,* and then they'll jump to o7.

Maybe that's what Sam meant when he said he's going to merge the two lineups. Even numbers are for the GPT family and the odds are for the o family. 

Let's take it a step further. Maybe the o in o1 doesn't mean OpenAI the way SamA claimed, but instead stands for "odd".

All pieces of the puzzle align after GPT-8 and o9. The next product OpenAI releases will be xAI, the x being Roman numeral for 10. With the power of xAI on his side, Sam Altman will take over the world.

I've been doing software development professionally for 16 years, and as a hobby for twice that long. This post is so true in some ways, and I just can't get over how different it is.

  
The downside of course is that we will now have "software developers" that have very little real understanding of what is going on and just know how to keep asking AI (or using AI tools) to rewrite the code over and over until it "works" (as far as they can tell).</div>

The vast majority of my job is essentially already automated. I know this is mostly because AI work is overrepresented in the dataset as the models are made by other AI specialists themselves. And that we inherently know how to squeeze the most out of these models as we intricately know how they work.

But I wouldn't be surprised if my job is fully automated including every possible weird edge case by 2027. I don't expect regular software engineering to survive for long either.
