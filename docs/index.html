                        <div class="comment-body">Bit of a ramble but maybe Mal is another example of the Crossfit HQ wanting the prestige of being a proper sport but not wanting the responsibilities that come with it.

From what I remember, Mal pretty much was ridden on by the Crossfit Media as the next big thing from quite an early age.

I used to coach swimming in the UK and we had some young people go on to swim at a national level.  There is loads of rules around safeguarding young peoples mental health, privacy, what can be posted on social media etc etc.  There doesn't seem to be any of this in Crossfit, its down to the individuals and their team.

We seemed so keen in those years to hot house young teens and emerging talent in new training camps to make "the next Tia", that most people never stopped to think whether we should.  The Crossfit scene burnt through Mal, Haley Adams and others.  There was a massive drive to train and sculpt them into the ultimate female Crossfit Icons as soon as they were able by any means (PED rumors are probably untrue but also have never gone away).  There was a hosts of young female athletes that are all now off doing other sports or activities far away from Crossfit.

The focus was especially bad on new up and coming teen girls.  The boys seemed to get less hype and scrutiny.  I don't want to speak or read too much into that but it seemed noticeably different.  Quite frankly, i couldn't tell you who any of the up and coming male athletes are now.  But the Female ones are always being touted.

Crossfit isn't like swimming or gymnastics where if you haven't hit top Olympic level by the time your 17 its already over for you.  At the CF Games we have competitors into their late 30s and beyond who are standing on the podium after having kids.  Hot housing at a young age just isnt necessary.

If Crossfit wants to become "a proper sport" it needs to have policies in place and way of working with and protecting its young competitors.</div>

This is complete speculation on my part, but I think the reason why girls and young women get so much more hype than boys and young men is because HQ really likes promoting the image of muscular women to the masses since a muscular woman evokes a lot more attention than muscular men. While muscular men aren't "common," a person might go out on their daily routine, and if they see a muscular dude, it might draw some attention, but unless they are bodybuilder huge, it probably won't be something that said person would think about since it fulfills the narrative of "well, men are strong, so that makes sense". On the other hand, muscular women are much more rare, and runs counterculture, so if said person sees a muscular woman, that's going to hold their attention more.

Furthermore, CrossFit and its women athletes often have a narrative of getting women into the weight room (kind of like Dani Speegle's "Girls Who Eat.") That's a good thing, and it's awesome seeing more women hitting the weight room whereas 20 years ago it was still mostly men, but you're not going to foster that image or that motivation from the men, or for that matter from "above average" women. They need to highlight the superstars and the girls who show potential to hit that elite level.</div>

She's at a point in life where most people here age are learning who they are, going to school, finding careers, finding partners, making new friends. It's a really busy time in life and to give that entire space up to be in the gym full-time year-round would be hard except for a very small number of people who want to make it their entire lives. There is no life balance being a competitive athlete, really.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If the first place purse for winning the CF Games was 10 million dollars, then Mal O'Brien would not be a full time retired CF athlete right now. If it was 10 million, MOB would come in 250th every Games, because the Games would then attract top level athletic talent from other sports. The Games athletes who "win" right now are those who win based on this amount of money possible given the current circumstances. 

What's the upside? You have to train full time. You have to go into extended isolation that is inherent with this kind of attrition and training. There is no pension plan and no retirement plan for being a full time CFer. Most will suffer long term injuries for life based on this kind of training. Heavy PEDs usage takes a massive toll on anyone's body over the long haul. If you are a female, you will be sexually objectified by CF HQ's marketing. You also have to deal with morons like Dave Castro. For a dying brand and a dying sport. Again, what is the upside. 

I have no personal ill will with MOB, but for the average CF box all over the country, it's probably better that she's not participating anymore. It sends the wrong message. Her "success" sends the message that this is what you can get, this is what you can reap in terms of money, opportunity, "celebrity", status and so forth if you use PEDs as a teenager. Someone had to get her PEDs and teach her how to use them as a teenager. Where is the integrity in that? Where is the dignity in that? That's a horribly toxic message to send to young people who participate in CF. That this here is a shining example of all the material gain and status gain you can accrue if you juice up. 

A local small CF box is a "community". Part of the duty and obligation of that community is when you have young people around it, and most boxes invariably do, then you have a responsibility, the adults there, to set a good example and push those kids to make good choices in their life. To develop not just in terms of fitness and health, but to be good solid fundamental people period. How do you promote any of those core values if you also embrace people who are jacked up on gear? 

Keep that out of my box. No, seriously, keep all that shit out of my box period. It's the wrong message to send, it's the wrong example to follow, and I want my CF box to have no part of it. Like I said, I wish MOB no personal ill will. She made her choices. But in my book she's no example for young people in CF to follow.</div>

No company has released anything interesting with phones in years. The foldable phone is the nicest thing released so far, but I'll never spend 2k on a phone.

I don't give 2 shits about anything AI related to phones. I don't care about enhancing photos, and I don't use voice features.</div>

It’s in your pocket and always listening to your surroundings.

Want to buy that latte? It’ll warn you that are already over your calorie intake for the day and to stay away to stay healthy.

Want to buy a new pickup truck because your old one is dying, it’ll offer a better alternative that is more environmentally friendly so that you can do your part to save the earth.</div>

Edit: upon getting it to work again, it says:

"In terms of accuracy, I’m generally quite reliable in recognizing when I don’t know something—better to underclaim than overstate. But sometimes I might say “I don’t know” when, in fact, I could provide a reasonable answer (I err on the side of caution).

👉 Do you want me to break down how often I’m too cautious versus when I’m genuinely uncertain?"</div>

First spend some time writing out (yourself) a detailed outline of the website and the needs. BE DETAILED, it's fine if you ramble on the stage. List all the pages you'll need, then for each page describe them in detail. Talk about the database, all the data you'll Want to store. Any hosting service you might use EVERYTHING.




NEXT
 take that document you wrote and give it to chatGPT 5 thinking and have it a) reformat the document to be more cohesive, and create sections in the new website outline document for the parts of the full stack architecture you didn't mention. Talk with GPT about those sections until the whole document is filled out. 


NEXT
Open a new chat with GPT 5 thinking, give It the fully laid out website outline and have GPT convert the outline into a detailed step by step guid for AGENT which doesn't leave room for assumption. The instructions will end with the agent sending you the finished product as a zip file. 


FINALLY
open a new chat, activate the agent mode, paste the instructions, and in 15 minutes youll have the whole thing. 


There will be some errors, they won't be big, probably an import error and some spelling mistakes but that's it. I'm website will also need some more work to make it look better but it'll be fully functional.




From here Id recommend getting everything into your GitHub, then connect It to the GPT codex as this will be the best way to ask questions about the code base</div>

                <div class="post-content">When I used to sit down to meditate, I would have an idea about what it was supposed to be and feel like. It's natural. I would try to do something with my breath, something with my mind, maybe something with my body, and hope to achieve a certain kind of experience. 

Eventually I would grow tired of trying to make something happen. Something would kick in to say "relax, stop" and all the trying would just wind down. That's when I'd find myself just sitting there, breathing, being, quietly.

But it's also possible to make too little effort, and then we need to stir up energy and firm up what we're doing. In that case, it's first after trying a bit more that we find the right spot.

Inhale deeply through your nose for 3 seconds
Hold your breath for 2 seconds
Exhale fully through your mouth for 1 second
Repeat this cycle 5 times and your brain will reset to a calm, focused state—whether you’re stuck in traffic, prepping for a test, or even floating in zero gravity.
This quick trick regulates your nervous system instantly, helping reduce stress and improve mental clarity without any tools or setup. Try it next time you need ...</div>

I remember reading people use 3 counts in, 2 counts out for running (shorter exhales than inhales)

But on the flip side use things like 4-7-8 breathing (shorter inhale, long hold+exhale) for slowing down heart rate</div>

It helps me to visualize inhaling a calming light and exhaling my dark anxious energy, and exhaling slowly like I'm blowing a dandelion. It sounds silly, but those additional things help calm me down that much faster.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Can confirm. The trick in triggering the relaxation reflex is having the exhales at least a little longer than the inhales.


OP's count can lead to hyperventilating.


One of the most effective breathing techniques is box breathing that others have been recommending (4-4-4-4)</div>
