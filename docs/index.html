                                <div class="reply-body">Here is one theory I came across:

&gt;But, after extensive analysis of the photograph, Mr Bara has destroyed the theories of alien or experimental military craft in a 35-minute YouTube video.

&gt;He looked at images of the area where the UFO was snapped and found there should have been hills and mountains in the background.

&gt;After checking weather conditions from the time the photograph was taken, Mr Bara discovered there was cloud cover from 1,500 feet to 2,500 feet at the time, meaning it was very low and getting lower.

&gt;He then overlaid the UFO picture on the new image of the area, matching up fenceposts and found what he claims is the UFO was an optical illusion.

&gt;He said the diamond-shaped object in the famous image is actually a mountain peak covered by fog.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I find it annoying how such incredible technology like Neuralink can't even be discussed in a positive light without needing to add some sort of fucking CYA disclaimer at the beginning that you dislike Musk. This has gone overboard. Does everyone feel the same way about all their products? Do they have to say "I hate Koji Sato for trying to slow down EV development but I love my Toyota Prius"?

Do they have to say "I hate Albert Bourla for his greed but I think the COVID vaccine was a great thing"???

Why can't we just fucking talk about amazing technology that's literally letting paralyzed people get their lives back. Especially because half the tie people talk shit about Elon it's to say that he doesn't do anything meaningful and it's all the engineers... Okay so shut up about him then.</div>

That's what PR people call "free advertising," through social media or other means. Joe is probably the best source of earned media in the world now, and he's choosing to give it almost exclusively to the right and is lately throwing in a healthy amount of billionaires into the mix.</div>

We're supposed to think that a guy who has spent decades around some of the world's best athletes looked Trumps body and just organically thought "wow, this guys is in great shape". No, these interviews are infomercials. There are things he's clearly supposed to ask about, and not ask about.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/PositiveSong2293:

---

In October 2017, an intriguing post appeared on the Facebook page “Art Bell’s Midnight In The Desert Feat Heather Wade.” The post featured a daytime photograph of a “UFO” in the desert, with a helicopter hovering above the scene. The accompanying text read: “I’ve had these photos for 10 years, and it’s time to share them. They were taken in July 2007, during a radar test at our field in the Mojave Desert. I’ve always hesitated to show them, but here they are now.”


"In an attempt to get to the bottom on these alleged UFO photographs the have been analysed by five different people from around the world. Jason Gleaves from the UK is of the opinion that they are the genuine article. Dr Bruce Maccabee from the USA is not sure whether they are fake or real and the same goes for Tobias Lingren in Sweden. And last but not least Ricardo Varela and Inajar Kurowski in Brazil left us in no doubt that they believe the photographs in question to be fake."

I work with the creative industry every day, and 6-8 years ago I had an experience that i've mentioned here before on my normal account, where I saw a huge chrome sphere several stories tall, hanging perfectly still, right next to a skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur... I was with a whole group of people and I was the only one that thought it was "weird" or interesting. Everyone was just like "LOL UFO" and went on with drinking....

In other notes - except the shape, my experience is exactly the same visuals as these pics. For what it's worth.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Zuck is definitely scared shitless. Is Joe or no one on this sub gonna bring up the quote from Trump's new coffee table book that he is selling. Captioned under the Pic of Zuckerberg visiting the White House: 

“He would bring his very nice wife to dinners, be as nice as anyone could be, while always plotting to install shameful Lock Boxes in a true PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT.

We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time **he will spend the rest of his life in prison** — as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.” 

https://apnews.com/article/trump-book-zuckerberg-prison-election-donations-putin-b717f6248311b3ed002d872ec97d59d9

This is not someone quoting him, this is the unhinged shit Trump chose to publish to the public in his new book about his first term. Can you imagine the private threats he's received from him? No wonder Dana got his seat on the board.</div>

I don’t mind cooking in the evening- that’s the fun part! But getting all the prep done means all your mirepoix is ready, the salad is all washed, the stir fry veg are chopped, the meats are sliced and marinated. It saves so much time and energy in the evenings.</div>

The only reason ocean freight is even remotely safe from other nations and paramilitary groups is because of our fleet.

If we hadn’t made the spends maybe life would be better domestically but it would probably be a net negative globally.</div>

For context, I am two things, one is a very sceptical person, so I am the nerd that goes “source?” when I hear something outlandish; the other is I am very practical, I’m the one that keeps calm despite panicking inside during a crisis, the one who needs to know the...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There's a natural bias that makes cynical people or pessimistic people sound smarter. This aspect of psychology is important and even comes up tangentially in topics like investing. Cynical people are actually often stupid, but "next year is gonna be amazing!" doesn't have the same ring as "next year is the end of the world!" Even though neither one is a particularly better prediction.

Anyway, Reddit is the worst. TikTok is probably the happiest social media but lots of people say it's the worst one for some reason. Depends on your feed, I guess.</div>

Unfortunately the short form content really does ruin your attention span so I think it's overall worse for mental health. Not that Reddit is the holy grail many people make it. I see so many say they don't even consider Reddit social media because they "learn so much".

  
Like, I know i can't talk because I'm still here too. But this site is definitely social media, and definitely not as educational as people here like to believe. You spend 90% of your time scrolling through BS and reading the same snarky comments over and over. Then the other 10% of the time there's some really helpful info about your niche hobbies which seems to make the other 90% worth it. Is it? Probably not. But not sure what else to do.</div>

but I *"Ackchyually"* wanna add that there are times happiest ≠ better since tiktok's algorithm is feeding you dopamine rush nonstop just like other addicting stuffs. For me, there's always beauty in the balance either way.</div>

Currently for me the one social media that actually doesn't make me feel like complete crap as long as I use it only a reasonable amount of time is Tumblr. Because of I just put fandom stuff in my interests and only follow fandom accounts the algo will only give me that kind of content instead of shoving in a bunch of news related nonsense.

I’m an artist and a long time ago I remember when AI was introduced to the art space I was telling some people to really start to collaborate more, do projects and learn marketing as a solution to the situation I was met with so much hate for being practical where as people were panicking lol. But knowing now most of the people on Reddit are bots,people going through a phase, or just people yelling in the echo chamber. Like you wrote I think the best thing to do is spend more time in real life with those we have a bonds and connections with then on the internet for sure it’s helped out tremendously id say my only problem is Reddit even though I usually just come to this sub mostly and Pinterest.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Fun fact: That was actually a demo for a full length game, that came with an array of different pinball designs to play. 

Unfortunately, due to the fact you actually had to call a phone number, and the company name being barely readable in it due to a font issue, it flopped terribly to the point many people didn't even realise you could purchase a full game.

                                <div class="reply-body">One of my best memory games, too, although from before 1995.

I used to stay at my grandmother's some weekends because she had a computer (and some games).  She bartendeded and one night she got home after work (~1:00 am) and I was playing SimCity.  I explained a bit about the game and she wanted to try it out.  She started playing and I went to bed.  I got up the next morning, and she was still playing.  That became our game.  We played a *ton* of SimCity.  Then SimCity 2000 came out and that really kicked it up.  So much more to figure out.  We even bought the books (that were *beefy* books, few hundred pages) and poured over them all the time.  We still swap SimCity memes all the time and I play a ton of 2000.

One of the games I'd love to get a remake is SimCity 2000.</div>

I mean have you used o1 as a software engineer? I don't see the hype, nor anything even close to agentic systems replacing engineers en mass this year.

As the economist titled, 'It's crunch time for AI' this year, they either make their business cases or we are going to see a huge drop in investment in these companies.</div>

Chollet tend to think that thinking should cost way less than the compute we throw at it right now, ARC trained o3 takes 13 minutes per ARC task while an ARC trained human probably takes 10 seconds median time, and a symbolic solver would never take more than a second.

not to say this isn't interesting and impressive, but I don't think it is a valid measure of consciousness.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">From ChatGPT:

  
"Many scientists believe that animals have some level of consciousness. They can show emotion, solve problems, and respond to their surroundings. But we don't know exactly how they experience awareness. Different animals might have different forms of consciousness. Research on this continues."

"Some level". I'm not an expert but I guess technically this should level of consciousness.

Also some animals pass the mirror tests like goats, elephants or dolphins apparently:

&gt;The **mirror test** is used to assess self-recognition, a possible indicator of self-awareness or consciousness. Some animals do pass the test, suggesting they recognize themselves in a mirror. Examples include:

&gt;**Great apes**: Chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and some gorillas.

&gt;**Elephants**: They’ve been observed touching marks on their bodies visible only in a mirror.

&gt;**Dolphins**: Bottlenose dolphins demonstrate self-recognition by inspecting marks on their bodies in mirrors.

&gt;**Magpies**: This bird species has shown the ability to recognize themselves by removing marks seen only in a mirror.

&gt;However, many animals fail the test, but that doesn't necessarily mean they lack self-awareness. The test may not suit all species due to differences in perception, behavior, or cognitive priorities. For instance:

&gt;Dogs might fail because they rely more on smell than sight.

&gt;Other species might not care about or understand the mirror's significance.

&gt;The mirror test is just one way to explore animal consciousness and has its limitations. Many researchers argue for broader approaches to understand the diverse forms of awareness across species.</div>

For instance, we have clear example of these models taking steps to prevent themselves from being shut off and/or to protect themselves from further training. Which means they developed a model of the world. They developed a model of their place in the world. And they wish to maintain their place/their existence to accomplish whatever goals they've been tasked to accomplish.

Some would call survival instinct an example of consciousness. Others would dismiss it altogether. 

And so the goal post will continue to shift... even as the models continue becoming more capable.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A few years ago, I hit a point where I felt completely stuck. My mind was a chaotic mess—constant overthinking, self-doubt, and no clear direction. I kept feeling like I was running in circles, and it seemed like no matter what I tried, I couldn’t break the cycle.

That’s when I stumbled upon the idea of journaling. At first, I thought, How could writing in a notebook actually change anything? But I was desperate for clarity, so I gave it a shot.

Here’s what I did and how it helped:
	1.	Dumping the Chaos:
Every morning, I started with a simple brain dump. No structure, no rules—just writing down everything in my head. It felt like taking out the mental trash. After a few weeks, I noticed I had more space in my mind to think clearly.
	2.	Tracking My Thoughts:
I began noticing patterns in my writing. I realized how often I was self-sabotaging with negative self-talk. Seeing it on paper made it easier to challenge those thoughts.
	3.	Setting Intentions:
I started ending each journaling session with one simple goal for the day. It gave me a sense of purpose, even on tough days.
	4.	Reflection and Gratitude:
At night, I’d write down three things I was grateful for and one thing I learned that day. Over time, it helped shift my focus from what was going wrong to what was going right.

The results? Life didn’t magically get easier overnight, but I became more grounded, self-aware, and intentional. Journaling became a mirror that helped me see myself more clearly—my fears, my strengths, and what I truly wanted out of life.

Now, it’s my go-to tool whenever I feel overwhelmed or stuck. It’s amazing how something so simple can have such a profound impact.

If you’re thinking about starting, my advice is to keep it simple. Don’t overthink it—just write. You might be surprised at the clarity it brings.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Journaling has been a lifesaver for me. 

What you do each morning sounds familiar to a habit I began this time last year called “Morning Pages.” In the beginning I only wrote the recommended three pages. The more I wrote the less depressed I was. Then I began noticing small changes in my attitude. Next, I discovered that I couldn’t bear to miss a day. I wrote longer and my topics varied . 

Once I began writing down the awful things that occurred or when something didn’t go the way I expected or wanted — I broke down the steps leading up to my failure or disappointment. That’s when I finally realized how much of the responsibility for my actions were all on me — no one else. 

Adding the grateful pages was uplifting and forced me to recognize all the wonderful things I have and how thankful I am for them and the people in my life. I stopped concentrating on what had gone wrong or what (or who), I’d lost and felt an authentic appreciation for what I have and an even deeper appreciation and gratitude for the people in my life.

I started adding daily, weekly, monthly and yearly ideas and projects. I wrote what I hoped to accomplish and broke down the steps needed to get to the final result.

Journaling is a comfort and I believe everyone can benefit from it. 

My mom died a few years ago and my sister and I kept what each wanted from her home. After dividing up furniture, art work  and other valuables we found hundreds of notebooks and journals . My sister didn’t want them so I took them all. 

It took me a long time before I could read her thoughts, but now I read for an hour or so whenever the mood strikes. 

It’s the best gift she left behind. Learning of her own struggles and the methods she used to get out of a crisis has been super rewarding. I love reading her insights. Obviously, I’d never have read any of this while she was living. 

Now, it seems like a map, a compass or her way of navigating me in the right direction. 

We were amazingly close and I never knew she journaled and kept her writing. I hope I keep doing it for the rest of my life. The benefits and rewards are too many to name.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That sounds amazing! Where did you take this class? I’m actually not sure if I know how to swim. My parents are both great swimmers, and they often took me swimming as a child. But when I swim it looks like I’m flailing and when they swim it looks effortless. Also they can tread water and I can’t. Also in college, we had to swim 2 laps to graduate, and I failed it bc I could only swim 1 lap before I got too tired. So I had to take a swim class in college. But it was mostly how to float so I didn’t learn anything new. You just reminded me that maybe I can still learn how to swim, even in my 30s.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean did you read the article? He goes over what he's trying to say here:

&gt; I think we are going to see a lot more froth about agents in 2025, but I expect the results will be a great disappointment to most of the people who are excited about this term. I expect a lot of money will be lost chasing after several different poorly defined dreams that share that name.

&gt; What are agents anyway? Ask a dozen people and you’ll get a dozen slightly different answers—I collected and then AI-summarized a bunch of those here.

&gt; For the sake of argument, let’s pick a definition that I can predict won’t come to fruition: the idea of an AI assistant that can go out into the world and semi-autonomously act on your behalf. I think of this as the travel agent definition of agents, because for some reason everyone always jumps straight to flight and hotel booking and itinerary planning when they describe this particular dream.

&gt; Having the current generation of LLMs make material decisions on your behalf—like what to spend money on—is a really bad idea. They’re too unreliable, but more importantly they are too gullible.

&gt; If you’re going to arm your AI assistant with a credit card and set it loose on the world, you need to be confident that it’s not going to hit “buy” on the first website that claims to offer the best bargains!

&gt; I’m confident that reliability is the reason we haven’t seen LLM-powered agents that have taken off yet, despite the idea attracting a huge amount of buzz since right after ChatGPT first came out.

&gt; I would be very surprised if any of the models released over the next twelve months had enough of a reliability improvement to make this work. Solving gullibility is an astonishingly difficult problem.</div>

It wasn’t important to me but it was helping people have second income streams and share footage.

Also our government doesn’t give a shit about China getting data, Meta lobbied hard to get TikTok banned. They only banned because TikTok wouldn’t sell to an American company so they could be the ones poisoning our minds and profitting off data. Another will come or people will fall back
to Meta’s apps where they’re gleefully handing over our info to the police, government, Mark Zuckerberg’s dog walker, and whoever else.</div>
