If a project has a due date or someone is relying on me to finish something, I’ll buckle down and get it done. But when I’m working on something with no immediate deadline—like a personal project, studying, or organizing my home—I tend to procrastinate like crazy.

For example, I’ve been meaning to declutter my workspace and finally organize my files, but it’s been on my to-do list for months. Every time I thi...</div>

Limit your time. Give yourself x amount of time to do something, hard limit.

Edit: The Idea is not to set an artificial deadline for when you have to be done with a task (unless that works for you). 

The idea is to set a time limit where you get to do a task. If you aren't done in time, try again tomorrow. Might work best with things like reading where it's more about the journey.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The pomodoro technique works really well for me in this regard. That's because the time frame (25 minutes - 5 minute break - repeat) is short enough that even my mammal brain can comprehend it. It sort of enables it to act as a focus exercise as well, since you have to catch yourself if you are getting distracted and be like "you can think of that in 15 more minutes (or whatever is left), back on task for now". You just have to decide how many 'pomodoros' you need to put in each day, and then actually get yourself to sit down and start it. 

For sitting down and starting it I sort of use an induction method where I just make myself sit quietly and breath, clear my thoughts a bit, and then think about the task that needs to be done. It is a lot easier to convince yourself to sit down and think about something than it is to actually do something. But after thinking about it and why it needs to be done it is a lot easier than trying to jump straight into the pomodoros without clearing your focus.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's pretty tough. In school, I found it was pretty effective to break down my daily schedule and carve out time to work on specific projects. Even if the deadline was still months off, setting that time aside motivated me to get it done.

For my personal projects, I also find it *really* helps to have another person involved to motivate you. I try to bring in collaborators on projects or ask a friend to be an accountability buddy. Knowing that *someone else* knows you've been putting it off can give you the same kind of drive that a deadline would.</div>

2) Wrong understanding. They only reported 5m$ as the cost it would be to rent 2000 H800 GPUs that they have trained the final model on.  
But since a weird silly notion has formed, that the final model's training run's cost == the total cost it took to make the model, including salaries, data processing, experiments and many more... well, since big companies do not give out all the exciting and important data, people form assumptions, spread them, distort them, and then it can bite the secretive companies back in the ass. Or not just the companies.</div>

A Chinese Lab spent $5M to create a SOTA model that beat o1 that no western AI researcher has been able to explain how they pulled it off. 

Or the fact that China is desperate to stay competitive with the US on AI and are evading exports controls and procuring H100s.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">These US CEOs are literally pulling numbers out of their ass to make themselves look less of an embarassment. The 50k H100 GPU claim first came from [Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis](https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1859302712803807696) on Twitter, but there is literally no source or backing for his claim. In fact, you can tell he is just pulling numbers out of the air when he [replies to a tweet](https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1882554660269248600) estimating that DeepSeek would only need H800s and H20s for training.

The 50k GPU claim was then parroted by a bunch of CEOs, but you can tell they are just grasping at straws to save face. All of the methods, architectures, and size of the open source model indicate that the published figure of around 2k H800s is correct.</div>

 The guy who made it is a digital video content creator.
This was posted on the nj drone fb page by him and he was questioned about it, he never replied which was kinda odd. 

Everybody who post their personal videos comment and reply to people's questions. He never did and still hasn't.

Now if that guy is reading this and you want to at least address that, please do so bc no one believes you on the nj drone fb page.

Edit : And for what its worth his Instagram page is a wall of selfies. No crime in that , but he definitely likes attention.
He just doesn't really like to respond to anybody about this awesome footage on the page he first posted it on. Which does not happen on that page.</div>

Notice how the orbs have no motion blur on them when he's moving the camera like for example the trees or the house.

I dont know much of the background yet, but if the footage is legit, it's so nice to get a post with observables. The rapid acceleration (from hover, center screen darting leftwards at about :34s in) alone is enough to make this very intriguing. More videos that can't be explained with human tech, in other words, that displays observables, is what we need.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/CreditCardOnly:

---

[Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) responded](https://x.com/senschumer/status/1882555171596804472?s=46&amp;t=M0ofkkf9lgSjlI29wi9d5w) to the news of President Trump’s executive order calling for the declassification of the JFK, RFK, and MLK files.

Schumer simply said “Now do UFOs.”

It’s great to see Schumer still engaging on the topic.

There’s the Philips one that’s like $130 dollars that’s always recommended, and Amazon has one that’s like $35 that seems to do pretty much the same thing (although a little less bright) that I’ve been wondering about. $130 seems too expensive for something that seems like it would be pretty simple to achieve.</div>

So whenever I sleep, I usually wake up 8 hours after that even without alarms to wake me up.

                        <div class="comment-body">Any cold and flu medication with phenylephrine as the “active ingredient” for decongestion. Complete scam.

Drug companies just wanted to minimize their losses when purchasing limits for pseudoephedrine were introduced, and came up with an alternative product that would plausibly work in theory, but actually doesn’t.

Source: Am doctor. But [here's](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2023/phenylephrine-cold-medicine-decongestant-ineffective/) an expert panel from the FDA stating so as well.

Edit: lots of people asking “what works” instead. Phenylephrine sprays still work. Just the oral tablets are useless. Oxymetazoline sprays also work. And of course, the old Sudafed containing pseudoephedrine works.</div>

The menthol can suppress cough reflexes, providing temporary relief.

Coughing less and more efficiently could lead to some substantial relief in some cases more than just tricking your brain.</div>

It also increases their status, and also harms american AI companies trying to suck up all the profits from AI by democratizing AI for **EVERYONE**.

And they are decided by the people who created the model. The “censorship” on western models are **self-imposed** by the creator.

so in that sense, the Deepseek model itself is less censored, because you can remove the censorship if you wish. Deepseek is more censored on its web interface, but you cannot use OpenAI models without going directly through OpenAI, and thus their censorship.</div>

ETA: Why the downvotes? I'm literally just stating a fact.

You can ask it how to get around the china internet firewall, what to look out for, how to use tor, how to pirate things and so on.   
It suggest happy ways to get around the regulation on buying crypto...  
  
You would think these things would be censored too.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">According to some Senators she also owes the taxpayers some money. 

Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst sent a letter to DOJ and ATF saying that 91 ATF employees had miscategorized job classification and were in law enforcement positions when they were actually doing Human Resources jobs. Which led to an overpayment of $20M in salary. 

This lady had her job classified as a law enforcement  position and when she was asked about it by the Senate- according to Senate- she ignored them. 

I don’t know the details but I can’t see how a DEI lead is a law enforcement position and entitled to more pay. 

Here’s the letter: https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-ernst-demand-corrective-action-for-atfs-illegal-scheme-to-misclassify-law-enforcement-and-fleece-taxpayers</div>

This may or may not have been true years ago but today the Chinese are innovating everywhere. From fusion research to AI, they are really pushing the field forward, and good for them. China is nowadays amongst the top world leaders in research and this should be acknowledged. Deepseek is a clear sign of this since even a Google Deepmind employee is quoted saying "We are learning lessons from Deepseek".</div>

He kinda invented the political climate we have in the US today where science and education is political and can be ignored or ridiculed. As such we haven't been investing as much in education or research and have rested on our laurels to the point where China has caught up or surpassed us.

Sure, if you try to use it like Twitter or Facebook or whatever, it's dogshit. If you go to the massive subs like r/politics or really anything in the first page of [https://www.reddit.com/best/communities/1/](https://www.reddit.com/best/communities/1/), it's likely to be garbage for anything outside of just casual lurking.

Those false promises being that we will be entertained on Reddit, that we will learn something, and that we will engage in and become part of a community. None of those are true beyond the shallowest sense of interpretations.

I've been there, and read a lot of posts on this sub from others who have as well. Since Reddit is my only social media, I notice a significant contrast in my life during the periods when I quit this site.

Primarily I think the reason I keep coming back is a lack of social contacts and community in my real life. All my friends moved far away so we only see each other a couple times per year. Being offline completely is peaceful, but lonely. I think I keep returning to Reddit because I mentally trick myself into thinking the illusion of community here, is better than no community at all. Which probably isn't even true when weighing out all of the negative effects of this app.</div>

"Whether you like it or not, the future of AI will not be canned genies controlled by a "safety panel". The future of AI is democratization. Every internet rando will run not just o1, but o8, o9 on their toaster laptop. It's the tide of history that we should surf on, not swim against. Might as well start preparing now.

R1 shows open models can compete on much less budget at the very top end. Silicon Valley believes they can keep AI for themselves and ration it out, but that is not the nature of the technology.

The sheer gall to demand that all subs ban links to a platform over this nonsense. 

This right here is one example of what is wrong with social media- these ridiculous slacktivist campaigns that allow people to feel superior to others while accomplishing nothing, all over something as stupid as using Twitter. This will go down about the same way as those dumb api "protests", posting a black square in 2020, or when people were boycotting that Harry Potter game and calling anyone who played it a transphobe.</div>
