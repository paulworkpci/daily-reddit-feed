I could go to DR, but I'd prefer not to pay. I do have a lot of ankle and knee pain throughout my day. From what Im reading so far, those are flat feet syomptoms but don't necessarily mean it is flat feet. Maybe there is a also a list of symptoms?

Edit: I mean more like pain... what type of pain will I feel?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Fleet Feet stores will scan your feet and give you a readout of how they compare to the population average in several metrics, including arch height. You might just have to pretend to be interested in some running shoes.

That said, there's nothing wrong with flat feet (aka low arches). All the "problems of flat feet" are actually just problems of *weak* feet. Furthermore, you're unlikely to diagnose your own issues accurately. You can choose between suffering and shooting in the dark with your own guessed remedies, or paying up to see a podiatrist, orthopedist, or physical therapist. Like, it's 100% possible that your issues have nothing to do with your feet and are actually from tight hip flexors or weak glute meds or whatever.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Ive got somewhat flat feet - I can tell because my shoes wear unevenly on the inside of the heel.

I struggled with hip/knee pain whenever I was running regularly, especially if I used ‘stabilizing’ shoes to compensate for my overpronation.

About 15 years ago I started wearing barefoot style or flat shoes and shifting to a more natural barefoot walking/running gate instead of the more common heel strike that is prevalent with heavily padded running shoes and eliminated all my knee issues.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thats just bs. We know what happens because it happened before during the Industrial Revolution. Before then 90% worked with farming, today it’s less than 1%. But the farmers who lost their livelihoods because of automation didn’t get better lives. They had to take worse jobs in the coal mines and factories in the cities. They had to work MORE, not less, for starvation wages. The only ones who got rich was a tiny elite of super wealthy capitalists who owned the machines.

Things didn’t begin to improve until workers began to organise and demand things: like an eight hour workday, an end to child labour, universal suffrage, education, healthcare, etc. In places where the elite refused to budge there were even revolutions.

It will be the same with AI, or maybe worse, because AI and robots will replace all the jobs. There won’t even be coal mines we can find work in. There are already ”dark factories” in China.

Only the people who *own* the AI/robots will get rich. In theory, the solution might seem obvious: everyone should own and control the robots together, democratically. That way everyone will also share the profits. But in practice, politics is going in the other direction, so the future looks grim.</div>

I remember the dot com crash in the early 2000s, when everyone was desperately trying to launch an online business or put their existing business online. The AI bandwagon reminds me of that, but with more money and even more hype.
Despite all that hype, AI is not even beginning to deliver on the world altering claims that are being made for it. AI agents, coding assistants, video generators and solving maths problems is a world away from the sort of context aware, broad intelligence required to autonomously solve the sort of real world problems that businesses handle every day.
If you are really keeping an open mind, you have to consider the possibility that AI simply won't deliver. At the moment that's just as much of a possibility as the ”Brave New World”. The tech bros are literally betting that if they throw every increasing compute resources at the problem, AGI will inevitably emerge, which seems more like an act of faith than a concrete research plan.</div>

If this is true, then whenever this Advanced Deep Think $250/month model is released, it will be borderline AGI level, and a superintelligence in narrow domains. 

Imagine a general purpose model with IMO Gold Performance with similar performance in computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, philosophy, literature, arts, etc. 

Hopefully this isn't just hype. It is a bit odd that they're not showing what this model can do in subje...</div>

this is potentially emergent internal abstraction though, which is one of the holy grails. it depends how much prompt scaffolding was done. if they really did just point the model at the problems and say 'go', it's a big deal. I'm not sure that actually happened though</div>

“So whilst making the co-lo we discovered that human blood, in particular that from children, has an amazing ability to transport heat, so instead of using the usual coolant we got several gigalitres of blood from, ahem, Elon private supply"

It was at the sametime that we realised the best pumps ever made were in fact human hearts. So to avoid wasting the biomass from the blood extraction project we installed them as well. Damn things can run for the next 80 years without a problem.

Finally it was then discovered that we could use the brains, combining them into a single unit. The thing is amazing. It runs at 36c, has more compute then all the silicon on the planet, and has already gotten Elon to number one on the top Diablo player charts“</div>

I felt it in my chest, it was large and warm, like pure energy. I felt it spread through my entire body when I gave myself genuine love and kindness, I started crying tears of joy. It no longer felt selfish and the love flowed outward and felt so genuine when I wished other beings peace and love.

Yikes! Sounds like those other people were being selfish. While kindness towards others is great, you have to take care of yourself first!</div>

In Microsoft teams (what I use so ymmv), subtitles get added to a scrolling list so you see the current words, but you can also scroll up and see words that were spoken previously. So when the interviewer asks the question you can scroll up and leave it on the question.

  
If you've ever used Twitch chat, it functions the same</div>

Donald Trump is a hero.

In order to catch the world's most prolific pedophile, Mr. Trump had to think like a pedophile, act like a pedophile, and become friends with a pedophile.

When he was raping those young girls, he was doing it for us. He was doing it for mankind.

He's a goddamn hero.</div>

From a quick google asking how long they live:

*It varies according to species, but octopuses, both wild and captive, live roughly 1 to 5 years. This short lifespan is a consequence of a reproductive strategy known as semelparity, meaning that octopuses breed only once in their lifetime and die shortly thereafter.*

Since octopuses live short lives and reproduce quickly, this allows for faster adaptation to environmental changes.</div>

Plus, there's basically no way to tell if octopus biology, besides shape, was the same tens of millions of years ago.

[That’d be awesome but we have a pretty good understanding of their evolutionary path. This fossil is not even classified as a cephalopod (even challenged as a mollusk) and it has 10 arms, no hooks, no beak, no suckers, etc. etc. so you can see that OPs info is already a little misleading or incomplete.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/s/7P254UaZzQ)</div>

ChatGPT just won gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad using a generalized model, not something specialized for math. The IMO also requires abstract problem solving and generalized knowledge that goes beyond just crunching numbers mindlessly, so I’m thinking AGI is around the corner. 

Maybe around 2030 we’ll have AGI that’s actually deployable at scale. OpenAI’s building their 5GW Star...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’m going to go against the grain here and say that scaling is overrated. The IMO results show that models are already large enough and trained enough data to achieve general intelligence, it’s just a matter of reducing hallucinations, improving agentic abilities, embodied intelligence, and continual learning. 

None of the things will be achieved by training current models on 10 gagillion flops, nor do they need that kind of compute to be achieved.

Grok 4 was trained on 10x the RL compute as Grok 3 with pretty disappointing results to show for it. It’s better but not so much so that gains are worth building out billions in infrastructure.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I've got to disagree partly, I somewhat agree that the intelligence is nearly reached, but the overall effective AGI system hasn't been developed yet. Building huge AI farms is a must, not only for the intelligence but also the deployment of potentially trillions of entities working in parallel in the future.

Humanity should increase compute as much as possible. You may be disappointed by Grok 4, but this is because the average human is unable to adequately benchmark the most recent LLM models.</div>

Not sure how you'd ever get the 3.5 v6 into the Gr86. The engine bay is very tight from top to bottom so anything bigger than an LS (insane small for it's displacement) would fit.</div>

I suspect we are probably just making progressively smaller progress toward a true limit on what we can accomplish with the current available training data. 

We may not see the next major explosion until more robots start “living” among us and collecting 24/7 sensor data to train on.</div>
