It epitomizes this far-right cliché that the show has slowly been drifting toward. Instead of thought-provoking dialogue or challenging ideas, it now feels like an echo chamber of grievance politics, internet culture war talking points, and the sa...</div>

I used to be able to listen to every episode while I work but now I couldn't imagine listening to three consecutive episodes without making a brain matter and lead smoothie in my kitchen. He's stuck on loop it doesn't matter what kind of guest is on it's all the same four or five political points 

Could you imagine if he had like the Honey Bee girl on now versus when he did have her?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I started listening to Joe Rogan around the FIRST time he had on James Maynard Keenan and Niel DeGrasse Tyson. Somewhere in the 100s (episodes).

I listened to almost every episode until around 2019/2020 when covid hit. 

I still listen to choice episodes occasionally, but I'll often switch to something else mid episode if its not particularly interesting to me. Most of the time that is the case.

I hate to be this guy, but... Joe sold out. 

He used to do it for the lolz and because he was genuinely curious, but sometime during covid, he was radicalized and drifted into wacko-land.</div>

To me, OpenAI will need to respond to that product specifically for coding. Unless this model is so, so good that code editors and tools surpass all the agentic abilities of Claude Code - it could still be very close. For a company so focused on product, I’m surprised they have still not responded to this one.</div>

In all my tests using it, the results were identical across all these tools (same codebases, same prompts). Which makes sense to me, since they have almost identical system prompts and tools. The only difference noticed is that the UX of IDEs is much better. So I don't get why someone would use Claude Code.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">We as software engineers are basically beta testing our extinction. Claude Code has excellent potential for cloud integrations and automation workflows. So the endgame might be taking humans completely out of the loop. 
For now we still interact with Claude Code. But within 2 years this won’t be necessary. Coding often involves negotiating unclear or conflicting requirements and humans are still needed to resolve these. But it’s only a question of time when these negotiations can and will be done by AI too. I’m pro-AI, and love and use it every day. But just today I realised that the CLI nature of Claude Code makes it possible to remove humans out of the loop, which worries me as a software engineer.</div>

You use the interview as a trial commute and you leave yourself PLENTY of time so that you arrive early (because it never hurts to arrive early for an interview).  Interviews are often in the middle of the working day, so you can commute in "real" rush-hour working conditions at the time you would normally expect to do so, have the time to get lost or waylaid, still arrive tons early and if you need to - you can take a walk and find places for lunch, coffee, etc. if you start working there.</div>

Also, as a programmer, being able to give the api a context free grammar and have a guaranteed response is huge. 

Again, I'm disappointed with gpt-5 but I'm still going to try it out in the api and make my own assessment.</div>

Gemini-2.5-Pro costs less than Sonnet on paper but ends up costing more in practical use because of reasoning.  
  
The reasoning model will also take much longer to respond. Delay is bad for developer productivity, you get distracted and start browsing reddit.</div>

But Opus 4.1 to me seems quite a bit better than the benches would suggest. And as Max 20 subscriber I don't really care about the cost (which, let's be honest, is absolutely BRUTAL, similar to o3-pro)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Real world results are completely different. GPT5 outperforms it on complex debugging and implementations that span multiple files in large codebases. It's slower, but more deliberate, improvises less and sticks to your instructions more, then asks for clarifications or offers choice when something is unclear instead of wandering off on its own. Fewer death spirals where it goes in circles correcting its own edits. 

For smaller edits in a single file it makes no sense to use it, just use Sonnet 4. But if you have a feature that will need 5-6+ files to be edited, this thing is wondrous. Kicks ass in lesser known frameworks, too.

However, Anthropic is likely to be coming out with something fresh in the next two months, so we'll see how that turns out.</div>

Such "AI"s are just nice tools that can get you far as a layperson, but not to your goal.

The lack of genuine understanding intelligence will always be the ultimate barrier that chatGPT will never overcome because it has no consciousness: it is mere software in the end.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Probably because it will only be able to tow about 10 lbs. 

The Mojave X and Rubicon X with factory hard tops already have a payload of under 900lbs which really limits tongue weight with two passengers and gear. 

Coming from someone who will seriously look into this. 

Plus Gladiator sales have already been tanking</div>

Basically, take your ground spices and heat them up in the fat (butter, oil, tallow) that you're using in your dish . Do this for 30-90 seconds if you're using a nonstick pan on a hot open flame or up to 4 minutes if you're using a heavy bottomed pan on an electric cooktop with medium heat.

This is a simple step but makes your dishes taste ext...</div>

Move veggies (or whatever) to the side, and then collect a bit of fat to bloom the spices. After that I mix everything back up to distribute the flavor and continue as normal. One key step here: bloom the spices before introducing liquid to your meal, if you intend to do so. If you add spices afterwards you're effective just poaching those ground spices.</div>

I too had passed my 1000 day streak exactly 172 days back. Still keeping the streak running! 

My observation about the meditation is that every year I can feel some changes in me. On a daily basis nothing we will feel as a change while over a period of time if we recall our initial days of meditation, we can realize that there were a tremendous changes already happened in our perspective about the meditation, the life style, the thinking and many more. 

I started the meditation with a 5-10 minute session initially. Now it became 1 hour session daily. Initially I didn’t have a specific time to meditate, and mostly I was doing meditation in the day time. Now it’s early morning and regular regardless of whether I’m at home or traveling. 

For me it was transformative the past 3 years. After I started my meditation sessions a lot of changes in me. 

1. Conscious about my health 
2. More organized 
3. Overthinking is stopped
4. Everything is well organized 
5. Started waking up early like 4 am
6. I became more confident 
7. Opened up and transparent about what I’m really as a person
8. Digital minimalism 
9. Started reading book
10. Started regular exercises 

And many more. 

Happy to hear from OPs experience and from others too based on your long term meditation experiences.</div>

I just hope this is OpenAI stumbling and not the industry as a whole "hitting the wall".

The pricing looks REALLY good though so I think this was optimized for cost/speed and not absolutely best benches. Still, where is the Pro version???</div>

What a terrible look for OpenAI. Their models are failing in live demos, clearly the PowerPoint was created by AI and has major errors, and these engineers, as smart as they are, should NOT be on screen, they are so stiff and their “acting” seems so fake.

I appreciate the live demos, I get that shows some “trust” and a pre-recorded demo isn’t as “trustworthy”</div>

Epstein's spotify account also had an entire playlist about liking little girls including a song literally just called "pedophile".

It's crazy how blatant they are about this stuff

**EDIT**: Just wanted to add that I distinctly remember getting into arguments with MaxwellHill as far back as 2011/2012 when I was in high school, almost always involving me criticizing American foreign policy and her defending it, until she banned me from World News. I have personally spoken with Ghislaine Maxwell and been banned by her. What is this timeline??</div>

I regularly posted news that was critical of Israel, before I was permabanned for posting a single Op-Ed about Israel being the only country in the Middle East with nuclear weapons. That was still a taboo subject in 2014. 

I rewatched the Netflix documentary on Ghislaine Maxwell a couple weeks ago because of all the shit going on rn, and I was reminded of how she was probably the one who also banned me.

Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.

If you feel like your Doubles are wild and erratic, that you can get a few reps and then you trip up consistently, then it’s very possible that you’re moving too fast.
Double Unders are a combination of a Slow Jump and Fast Hands. The key is finding the timing. 

My Top 2 Drills are:
- Penguin Taps
- Ghost Rope

It’s difficult to get any number of meaningful practice repetitions when you’re spending more time stopping...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Obviously. But the issue is.. LLAMA scout is a small model. Why would they compare GPT-5, which is supposed to be large mainstream model, with the smallest model out of LLAMA lineup?  
Even more fun is that "Cohere v2" is not a model at all, it's a version of the API and their company has like 5 different models with very different performance, which one they are actually comparing to - who knows.

Opus 4.1 just came out and it's doing well early on and will likely by estimation come out on top. 

From early leaks of GPT-5 we know the model is certainly an improvement over 4. Do you guys think it will be as good as ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Opus 4.1 has been a really great model for me so far.  Especially when I've gotten it side by side with Opus 4 in web dev arena, the results have been pretty stark.  

Opus 4 was already pretty close to what I was seeing results-wise with a lot of the recent stealth models by OpenAI.  4.1 has been notably better.  

Anthropic definitely knows what they're doing around building models that perform extremely well on coding tasks.</div>
