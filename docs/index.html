If you had to pay to train a model on copyrighted material, it would mean you couldn't even scan and train on public facing, free websites if the works on those websites were copyrighted. 

On the other hand, pirating books is already illegal, whether you use them to train an AI model or not</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Its pretty interesting how people react when they see someone act on claimed principles. The hostility seems quite uncharacteristically extreme. One can see this in many forms of activism. I wonder if anyone has any theories for why this happens?

If I were to guess, I suspect an aspect may be a feeling of alienation from the activist due to being unable to put themselves in the shoes of someone willing to ostensibly make a willing large sacrifice. In an effort to come to terms with this alienation, many seek to create theories as to why the actions are not sincere, thereby reconciling the activist with their own feelings of self-preservation by assuming it must be because of similar selfish reasons. Other strategies seem to be to doubt the intelligence of the activist, seeking to reconcile the difference through an assumption that the activist is not fully cognizant of what they are doing. Yet others seek to cast doubt on the use of the activism, pointing out ways that the action the activist is doing is ineffective in order to distance the activist's sacrifice from being in our realm of acceptability as a strategy. I propose that this resolves this alienation by making the action a "bad idea" and therefore outside the range of ideas to be considered seriously.

This alienation and hostility is common treatment among protestors of all political groups from the right to the left. What is interesting is that most of us would claim to have more respect for those who act on principles rather than just speaking. Yet, judging from the common reaction, this triggers something in people much more than plain words. How curious.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Gonna read the paper later (so I have no idea if this is the correct interpretation) but quick skim of their blog post leaves me thinking the following:

&gt; A better way to grade evaluations

&gt; There is a straightforward fix. Penalize confident errors more than you penalize uncertainty, and give partial credit for appropriate expressions of uncertainty. This idea is not new. Some standardized tests have long used versions of negative marking for wrong answers or partial credit for leaving questions blank to discourage blind guessing. Several research groups have also explored evaluations that account for uncertainty and calibration.

Sounds like the incredibly most obvious solution that everyone has probably thought about to reduce hallucinations

&gt; Our point is different. It is not enough to add a few new uncertainty-aware tests on the side. The widely used, accuracy-based evals need to be updated so that their scoring discourages guessing. If the main scoreboards keep rewarding lucky guesses, models will keep learning to guess. Fixing scoreboards can broaden adoption of hallucination-reduction techniques, both newly developed and those from prior research.

But I'm reading this correctly, it sounds like they're saying that it's not enough for *some* evals to be made to target hallucinations, but rather *all* evals need to. The existence of some (many) evals that incentivize guessing will have a measurable impact on making models hallucinate.


&amp;nbsp;


Edit: Reading

So essentially state the obvious "no shit, if you penalize uncertain answers, the models will hallucinate more", and basically state how partially it's the fault of AI labs benchmaxing, because almost all existing benchmarks mark incorrect answers the same as "I don't know". Since the VAST MAJORITY of benchmarks are misaligned for hallucination reduction, it doesn't matter if they then make a couple of benchmarks that reduce hallucinations. 

They also state that "avoiding errors" is much harder than "identifying errors" (again this is obvious, but reading between the lines, there were rumours of OpenAI making a universal verifier, which makes sense when they say it's easier to verify)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm really surprised to read this from OpenAI, as this misses the hardest aspect of hallucinations: uncertainty is not a property of the training data, it's a property of the model itself. Aside from some clear cut cases like "does God exist?",  a model's confidence in an answer shouldn't be predicted from the question; it should depend on the model’s own knowledge.

If you simply encourage the model to say "I don’t know" or "maybe…" and penalize overconfidence, then it'll start defaulting to "I don’t know" more often, even in cases where it actually *does* know. Conversely, it could still be confidently wrong when the question looks simple. OpenAI's tricks might improve user experience overall in some situations, but it doesn't address the core issue.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not really though. You can't train a model from scratch with just saying "I don't know" on everything as it actually doesn't know and will just get stuck there.

It's a very hard problem because the model doesn't know what it does and doesn't know while having to evaluate itself on it. 

The only thing I see working is a 2 phase approach where you first train for broadening knowledge and then post train for reducing guessing, but that also has problems.</div>

Either way it’s a win. And if they say no, ask again. 

Or if you want to be an amazing guest, do what usually needs to be done? Are you setting the table, go grab silverware and napkins. Are you running out of ice, go grab some from the store, or the other freezer.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Numbing/distraction never helped for my needle phobia because pain isn't the issue and it doesn't prevent the other symptoms that come from the panic leading up to exposure: crying, shaking, clammy, hot and cold, sweating, tunnel vision, heart pounding, hyperventilating, ears ringing, passing out...


What does help is 3mg of Ativan. Reduces the panic by half so it's tolerable and I barely remember what's happening which helps for future visits.


But doctors should be more proactive with helping needle anxiety/phobia since it affects 10% of the population and is a huge barrier to medical care! They should be working with patients to offer more sympathy, pain relief, anti-anxiety meds (pills or nitrous), or even just a dark quiet place to recover! I had a difficult time finding a place to get a COVID vaccine that could let me lie down during/after to avoid passing out which was very frustrating.</div>

I've suffered from this since I was a toddler, every time I got a shot and even more so during blood draws. 


About 10 years ago a friend who is a successful psychologist told me that if you flex and release your major muscle groups such as your thighs it reduces the impact of the vasovagal reflex and reduces the chances of syncope (fainting.)


It works pretty well.  I tell the medical staff i have the condition and what I'm going to do; they usually but not always have me lie down and by b flexing my leg muscles repeatedly I'm able to avoid the worst of it.  I've only had one or two bad reactions since I started doing it when it used to be pretty much every time before. </div>

It is particularly bad if I need an injection in an abnormal place like my shoulder or something. This gives me intense anxiety even if I have no real pain to speak of. It doesn’t end when the needle is removed either. Sometimes it actually worsens. It takes me awhile to “shake it off” after and calm down.</div>

I let the nurse know that I have fainted in the past so I need to lie down if possible. I keep my eyes closed the entire time and focus on breathing in deep through my nose and out through my mouth. And I think to myself that the sensations I’m feeling (the tourniquet, the alcohol swab, the slight pain) are all being done to keep me healthy and I should be proud of confronting my fear so that I am able to take care of myself. Afterwards, I stay seated until I’m confident I can stand without feeling lightheaded.</div>

I have no idea how they plan to convince people to buy these things for $200k+

EDIT: Okay I was wrong about the price, Elon is projecting $20k-$40k per unit.</div>

“Save America,” a Trump-authored coffee table book being released Sept. 3, includes an undated photograph of Trump meeting with Zuckerberg in the White House.

"He would bring his very nice wife to dinners, be as nice as anyone could be, while always plotting to install shameful Lock Boxes in a true PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT,” Trump added, referring to a $420 million contribution Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, made during the 2020 election to fund election infrastructure.

 “We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison — as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.”</div>

When his economics advisors pointed out that unemployment is like to go up, they fired them. This is just stuff in the last month. He was president for four years from 2017-2021... did people really think all the claims against him were a witch hunt or what?

                <div class="post-content">This 2014 Porsche Cayenne with the base 3.6 liter V6 just sold on CarsandBids for $125k.

Besides being very clean, coming in a beautiful/unique color, and having a 6-speed manual, there's not enough to justify this sales price in my opinion, especially with almost 65k miles.

What are your thoughts?</div>
