                                <div class="reply-body">AGI is not a victory condition. It’s not enough to reach some milestone first and be ahead, you have to stay ahead for all the years to come and you do that by building. A superintelligence that can cure individual diseases with three weeks of thinking time is not in the same league as one which can coordinate a worldwide network of robots and factories to construct a space elevator or a vertical food farm in every city. The datacenters today might be enough to train an AGI model but not to export and sell that intelligence at high bandwidth to the rest of the world and outcompete China in the global intelligence market. Decisions which shape the post-AGI or post-ASI world have to be made now by our dumb brains because infrastructure takes a long time to build.</div>

The only reason they would be shuffling this amount of money towards one project is if they were incredibly confident in the science behind it.

Like, last week, I was sayin’ ‘it’s over,’ now I’m sayin’ ‘we’re back,’ and you’re sittin’ there all smug askin’, ‘What changed?’ What changed? Everything changed! $500 billion, that’s what freakin’ changed. You know how much that is, Doc? More than most countries! That’s real power—real vision. People don’t throw that kinda cash around for some pipe dream.”

“And what, you think I’m supposed to just sit here like some mook and not get excited about that? Like I’m flippin’ sides or somethin’? Look, maybe last week I didn’t see the bigger picture, alright? But you got Sam Altman or whoever the hell pulling strings like that? That ain’t snake oil; that’s serious. It’s like—what’s the word—singularity? Yeah, singularity. This whole vibe shift, it’s real, Doc. You wouldn’t understand—it’s business, it’s respect, it’s momentum. You don’t hesitate when you see somethin’ big like this, you adjust.”

“So don’t sit there, all judgy, tryin’ to psychoanalyze me over a freakin’ vibe shift. Maybe the world’s changing, alright? Maybe it’s time we start changin’ too. And if I wanna say ‘we’re back’ this week, that’s my freakin’ prerogative.”</div>

When Iw as a kid in the 90s the adults told me to be sure to enjoy the internet before the corporations ruined it, and we are definitely at that point. Like cable people will naturally find something more entertaining.

It was easier to actually connect with real people on the internet in the early 2000s, which is what made it pretty addicting but now everything is so manufactured that it is just a slightly more stimulating version of TV. The average person will likely stick with the internet for a while, but the people who like to seek novelty, the trendsetters are already migrating away from it because there is nothing left for them here.

I think the young tech trendsetters are goign to naturally gravitate towards real world things like hacker/makerspaces. Face to face interaction ironically is the novel thing for nerds to do now. For non nerds (hipsters) they will jsut flock to other traditional third spaces like bookstores and coffee shops.</div>

                <div class="post-content">For those of you in southern U.S. getting your first decent snowfall, you should shovel the snow before the sun hits it. When it starts to melt, it gets wet and heavy. If you shovel before then, it will still be light and fluffy. It’s much easier to manage. Stay safe!</div>

He was facing 2 life sentences plus 40 years. 

"The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me," Trump said in his post online. "He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!"

                                <div class="reply-body">Doing some napkin math: 

Silk Roads fees before DPR for busted were estimated to have generated around 13 million dollars. If we assume 10 million of this was made before the 2013 BTC price jumps, and for eases sake settle at a $10/BTC average price, we get 1 million BTC.

The US government has reported seizing and auctioning ~350,000 Silk Road related coins, leaving around 650,000 coins unaccounted for. If DPR still has access to these tranches, it would mean over *$68 billion* dollars worth of BTC at current value, making him the 22nd richest person on the planet. Richer than the Charles Koch.

I don't think Trump's doing it for free.</div>

I have no idea what to do with my days and I feel like watching shows the whole day is not productive. I can read yes, I can clean the house, but at some point there’s nothing else. I’m also going to try to go back to the gym and exercise more but again, days are long and I don’t feel like doing the same thing over and over again.

Learn a language, learn to code, work on your public speaking, learn to dance, learn to cook, learn to edit videos, learn sign language, learn how to play chess. Literally anything!

There is a world of endless free resources provided you have internet access. It's not paid and it's not school, so feel free to bounce around, fail, get bored, try something else.

there was one in my area where we paddleboarded to an island in a lake, cleaned up the island, &amp; paddled back.  they provided everything.  more often though I'll volunteer at the local homeless shelter where they always need help. I'm usually in the kitchen for dinnertime every few weeks

What is Musk saying after doing the entire motion of the Nazi salute not only once, but twice?  Hopefully he’s saying that he fucked up and is anti-Nazi, anti-extremism, and that he could see how a reasonable person could interpret his 2 gestures as a Nazi salute?  Isn’t this what normal person would do?  It’s an easy thing to do after “mistakenly” making full Nazi salutes at a Presidential inauguration of all places.

I know Democrats and Republicans have their differences but I have to believe that 99% of Republicans aren’t cool with Nazi salutes IRL.  WTF is Musk doing?</div>

There are a ton of NSFW subs that are posting stuff like this, i find that super odd. Why, no one is going to those subs to be political, it's weird as fuck to make those into a political battle ground where people are jerking off... I would imagine it would be like going to a strip club and them telling you their opinions of elon musk and how you should think of him. That's weird, and to be honest not the people whom i want deciding what is and isn't moral to view.</div>

Edit: Thank you everyone for the discussion. We had a great night at the prison, and this helped get through the night, and it was productive! Lt. wouldn't agree I don't think, but challenging ourselves is valuable. It made me reflect on the good and bad, and that really helps keep myself grounded. 

I'll try and get anymore replies replied to later today.</div>

It is long, it is terrible but this is the full truth of what happened there and I genuinely recommend everybody watch it once. There is no commentary and there is no one forcing an opinion in this video. It is merely the footage documenting what happened and there is too much misinformation out there.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You can check my comment history - I am Conservative but also very much against Trump.  He uses my religion like a prop and core tenets as something to toss aside ("what's all this 'small government' stuff?  Don't we like things to be yuge in America?").

The pardons are bullshit, but the fact that he was able to run again is also bullshit.  He added more to the debt on an annual basis than any president ever.  He gave Putin everything he wanted.  He wrote the plan for leaving Afghanistan that Biden made worse (same thing happened with Eisenhower, Kennedy, and the Bay of Pigs).

First day in office and he removes us from a global NGO that's focused on health and medical oversight and removes price caps on medications.  Then, he pardons all of his dumbest supporters and a man who created a platform for drugs and child pornography, and starts a pissing match with cartographers over something that makes no sense.

I didn't vote for him, but I wonder how my MIL who's taking arrhythmia meds on Medicare is going to like her renewal after stumping for the Orange One through her condo complex.  Actually, I don't really wonder.  She's going to find someone else to blame and then she and my wife will kvitch about some shadow group causing so much inflation again.

The VA has been on a hiring freeze for a while, as I understand it, and directly patient care roles are on major shortages in some area. The federal hiring freeze all but ensures this will not be fixed any time soon. And the VA secretary is all for it.

So much for being pro-veteran. What could we expect from a draft dodger?</div>

Nobody is giving out money. The US government isn't giving out anything except vibes here - this an announcement which for some reason\* was made by the President of the US about three private companies (one of which isn't even publicly traded) committing to spend $100B building datacentres for OpenAI and hoping to pick up some partners for the other $400B. 

There is no evidence that the three companies have access to $100B to invest in this right now.

\* = In order to do what it has done, and muddy the waters between what is private and what is being done by the US gov.</div>

Look at the details of the rocks in the cave.

To me that looks like a it could be a screenshot from a game. Look at the textures, look at the shape of the rocks. 

I’m guessing this is something that was created in Unreal Engine with a filter over it.</div>

The egg itself has very obvious polygonal sides to it and isn't perfectly curved.

The floor is clearly using videogame texturing and the lighting and sheen of the floor scream unreal engine. The textures also as have been pointed out are likely using some displacement mapping. 

It's in literally every picture. Anyone buying this 4chan thing is an absolute moron or has literally never seen a video game or computer graphics in their life.</div>

Look at what happened with the drones. I think its likely that there were some drones involved, but it turned into mass hysteria where every object in the sky was being called a drone and misinformation about the capability of the drones became fact.</div>
