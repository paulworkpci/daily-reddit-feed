Cause i think they are not gonna change the forced feature  unless there will be mass cancelling. I am using free verison and it's not rerouting cause it's only 5. And if we are forced to use 5 then why to take subscription. We can use it like this.

Please mass cancel it. Otherwise we will loose the authority to select even after paying üôè</div>

However, with all the complaints I'm siding with the majority here and canceled yesterday with the hope that it will send a message.  I have to follow-up on everything it gives me, anyway.  

I saw something about parental controls being introduced.  Don't know how real that is but, if true, it could be the first step toward restoring functionality that everyone misses.  I hope so.</div>

I don't mind the aggressive percentages as it's really only one very tough set, though even reaching 5 at 85% or 3 at 90% is really hard. I've done well with those. Today was deadlift day, as (unfortunately) was Friday.

OP did y'all do 90% of your 1RM to calculate the percentages off of? For example if your true 1RM is 200, then your "training max" should be 90% of that or 180, so then 95% of that is 171.</div>

I've already hit a half-dozen PRs (for 3/4/5/6 reps at least) so it's been helpful. I think the logic behind the schedule is that if you do deadlift on Friday after a week of training, then the next week you're "fresh" for the deadlift day. But there's probably a better way to implement that.¬†</div>

claude: super quick responses, great for rapid prototyping

codex: takes its sweet time but output quality is surprisingly consistent

the kicker is that even though codex is slower, my overall dev time has decreased because I‚Äôm not constantly going back to fix logical errors or edge cases it missed.

I'll expand on it a bit. I heard on a podcast(I think it was Huberman) about something called "resetting your stress loop". Basically, during the day, we accumulate stress, and it's good to end the day with an activity that releases it. I think they ideally recommend something physical(a workout, a walk etc.). That explained to me why I feel best working out after work and not before. 

It's been years since I heard it so I don't know if I explained it correctly, but, at least in my experience, the concept is sound.</div>

Improved coordination across multiple tools and information sources enables the model to effectively leverage a wide range of capabilities in agentic search and coding workflows.

three weeks ago amidst all the claude inference issues, [i made a comment about sonnet feeling way faster like it was doing parallel tool calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ndafeq/3month_claude_code_max_user_review_considering/ndgevtn/?context=3), now i'm thinking i was A/B tested on. i'd never seen sonnet perform that well before</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is happening in Europe because the voters want it to. At the moment, most voters are doing fine and don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre going to be jobless soon. BUT, if one day most people needed welfare because they believed there wouldn‚Äôt be any more jobs *ever,* then the voting patterns will change again.

This is pretty basic stuff guys. Come on‚Ä¶

You‚Äôre looking at a swinging pendulum. And pendulums never swing one direction and stay there forever. Voting patterns have changed given the environment people are voting within. They will change again when the environment changes again.¬†

How could UBI (or something similar) not win elections under those circumstances?¬†</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is the issue. Welfare states historically have been funded by taxing workers - wages and salaries. When those stagnate or decrease and taxes on capital - land, robots, bank accounts, machinery, trucks - don't go up to match, you end up with less money. There needs to be more emphasis on taxing capital...and unfortunately that's tricky as it requires most of Europe's trading partners to also tax capital.</div>

In the industrial revolution displaced workers eventually found work in new sectors. 

But with AI we are talking about algorithms that don‚Äôt need breaks, benefits, or replacements. The work just vanishes. So no new jobs.

If workers have no income then how does the capitalist sell products?

And the AI tool replacing us uses our clean drinking water‚Ä¶

                                <div class="reply-body">China had to automate because their running out of surplus labour who want to work in those factories.

And not just for a single reason. Partly due to China move to a service economy. Partly because they have a huge demographic time bomb that is starting to hit them

The factories I know of in China are finding it hard to compete with the service jobs which are far easier, don't require any where near as much travel and which offer better opportunities.

Look i know which sub I'm in but jeebus, AI hasn't stolen millions of jobs in China.</div>

With world governments willing to restrain trade on behalf of chosen cronies, at best we live in oligarchy today, and transitioning to dictatorship. There will no longer be much need to "sell" anything to the people, you just mandate that they must have it, like car and health insurance. They must pay, no choice except maybe a false one to decide which oligarchy gets your money.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">For the n-time, UBI is a utopia, it's great on paper but it creates two very big issues:

1. it creates slavery. Let me explain, the political party that has the house is the one giving away UBI correct? Then elections come around and they say "The other party will cut your UBI and you will be starving, you have to vote for me!". Want to see UBI in action? Go read about the crisis in Germany in the 1920's and the NSV in the 1930's.

2. UBI has to come from somewhere. Look at the rising CEO's salaries to avg. worker salary. Anyone thinks that the corporations, that are controlling the govt., will give away money for the UBI all willy-nilly? Do you know any period in time where the greedy changed their heart and decided to give away their fortune for the greater good? 

So, all in all, no, UBI is not possible because it is as real as a unicorn.

Edit: And I don't have any answers - I don't know what we should do. I know that we will see a rise of new luddites and this new movement will be more violent than the one in the 1800's. And this will create more police states, no privacy, digital fingerprinting and some "trimming"</div>

Don‚Äôt prioritize things based on how important they are, but by how deeply it personally impacts you. Sometimes I‚Äôll realize that the thing affecting me the most is also really easy to take get out of the way. Suddenly the rest of my day gets a lot easier.</div>

Sometimes I have stuff in my ‚Äúnot urgent / not important‚Äù bucket but find that‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs pulling most of my brain power. This is an interesting exercise to find those, acknowledge their emotional significance, give them a bit of attention to see if you can clear it, and then refocus on the tasks that need immediate attention.

High impact + easy to do: do it right away

Tbh, there's some blame you can put on Sam though. He has constantly talked about treating users "like adults" and saying the models should be able to talk about taboo topics or be flirty... It doesn't seem like the rest of the C-suite agrees.</div>

They make such over the top and intense arguments, never have objective evidence, and their experience never matches with anything I've experienced despite excessive use. 

They all claim that they're using it for serious business but none of them can explain what this entails, they used to claim it was 'creative writing' but 5 is fantastic at creative writing compared to 4 when prompted to do so, the only thing it doesn't do it pretend to be your lover.</div>

Yes, 5-high can output a ton of tokens (and start circling around eventually), but it's also so much \_safe\_ it's disgusting. It can write Hailely-like procedurals well, but in terms of pulp/webnovels - even Gemini is miles ahead. 4o? It can straight up ignore parts of prompt, it doesn't try to cram all your scene context into it, it can rearrange orders of events, it's not trying to write \_safe\_.</div>

They also have decent document sizes, yesterday I tried uploading something to openai and it kept on saying nil, turns out the picture is compressed and their dpi support is too low lol. Such a fundamental thing, so Gemini own the competition here.


I had a problem with a vibe coded script yesterday, for some reason Gemini kept wanting to change one part of the code for no reason, Claude code oneshotted it.</div>

Markets shift to target those with money. Hence your big luxury and supercar SUV's. 

This is the fall of capitalism. Without controlled economies, "the free market" will simply charge after the only people with money, leaving the rest of us to fight for all of the overpriced poor quality ad-riddled cheap offerings that the manufacturers use as platforms to monitor you and sell data about you to anyone willing to pay. 

It's just not sustainable, and it's not about to get any better.</div>

You mean the market that has more lenient regulations for SUVs than cars? The one that subsidizes gasoline? With protective tariffs and bailouts for automakers that aren't very good at making cars? _That_ free market?

Markets shift to whatever corporations pay politicians to shift it to.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Claude 4 Opus's 7 hour claim was part of Anthropic's actual messaging, directly.

~~The 30+ hours figure is a random company's review that was put up on the 4.5 website among a dozen others.~~

Turns out it is one of Anthropic's claims, as per [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/787524/anthropic-releases-claude-sonnet-4-5-in-latest-bid-for-ai-agents-and-coding-supremacy).

The definition of "autonomous coding" can be stretched, and its theoretically possible for agents to run for dozens of hours. The METR long horizon graphs shows error bars  that can go quite wide. Main issue would be the actual reliability, which a few weeks of 4.5 use will reveal for us.

EDIT: Forgot, but yeah obviously METR will give a proper evaluation</div>
