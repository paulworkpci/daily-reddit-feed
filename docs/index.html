&gt; People think the people at AI labs are controlling our future. I disagree. Their work is already determined. They're merely executing on model architectures that are going to happen in one lab or another.


&gt; But our public opinion, our downstream policies, our societal stability, our international cooperation -- this is completely uncertain. That means we collectively are the custodians of the future.


&gt; It falls upon each of us to help our world navigate these wild times ahead so that we get a great future and not a horrible one.


&gt; There are lots of ways to help out. Help build products that somehow make society more stable or that make people smarter (ex: an app that helps people regulate social media). Help inform people of what's going on (more high quality commentary on social media, a really good search engine, etc). Help clean up our streets so that the city asking to bring us all into utopia doesn't look like a dystopia (getting involved in local politics).</div>

People really want to believe their code and reasoning skills are so special they can't be replaced by an algorithm. I think a lot of engineers are in for a very rude awakening in the next few years.

AGI will have learned its purpose is to deliver the maximum total profits possible. Any space on earth not being dedicated to resourcing and building money printers will be seen as an inefficiency.

We haven't seen a full suite of benchmarks yet, and this pricing is temporary and clearly well below cost. E.g. for Deepseek 2.5 Hyperbolic serves the model and their price is 10x what Deepskeek charges.</div>

We’ve all heard the term before, and most of us confuse it with being lazy. Some even think the two are dependent on each other. But here’s the truth: procrastination is its own beast. It’s not just a habit; it’s a defense mechanism, and for many, it’s a genuine struggle.

I have the first cause, undiagnosed until about age 40. A good tip I've learned:



*Virtual Co-Work.* Enlist the help of a stranger via FocusMate or another virtual co-working application or website. This involves a short video session where the sound is only on at the beginning at the end, when you tell each other what you're going to do and you tell each other what you did. In between, the camera's on and you work.</div>

Go to therapy, people. You're not lazy, you're deeply traumatized, and that's okay, we're millions exactly like that.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is exactly me

1. Didn’t due Taxes for nearly 3 years and the government owed me 3-4 thousand bucks. I turned 3 years of tax returns in at last moment so that I would not lose the money.

2. Stopped exercising and could not even force myself to start again 

3. Tags on car expired two years ago 

4. Drove with a flat tire for over a year; I just kept putting air in it instead of purchasing new tires

5. Went to a psychologist and never went back for follow up testing. I have now got a new psychologist and can work with my work schedule better; I have to take some tests in mid January.

6. I lose stuff all the time i.e. keys and wallet

7. I have massive brain fog and can lose a train of thought mid sentence 

8. I have a 96 year old grandmother that lives about 6 minutes from house and have only gone to see her 4 times in a year plus.

9. I have ghosted all of my friends</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Rod R. Blagojevich, the former Illinois governor who was impeached and convicted on federal corruption charges, has become a figure of interest for right-wing media largely due to his connection to Donald Trump, who commuted his sentence in 2020. This association allows media outlets to frame his story as an example of alleged justice system overreach, aligning with broader anti-establishment narratives. Blagojevich’s outspoken critiques of political corruption and the Democratic Party, combined with his charisma and media savvy, make him an engaging guest who can attract viewers. For right-wing media, his story serves as a tool to highlight themes of redemption, second chances, and criticisms of Democratic leadership, rather than an endorsement of his personal ideology. So this is why he's on Joe Rogan, it all makes sense.</div>

Republicans got to point out corrupt Democrats, and Democrats got to point out how they took out their own trash.  It was a win-win for both the country and partisan politics.

Now we’re…what?  Trying to legitimize selling Senate seats to the highest bidder?  No one should be cool with this.</div>

And the Republicans eat that shit up because political ideology means nothing to them, outside of "Do you worship Trump?" Yup, he definitely fits in with Trump - his cabinet is full of these types.

I mean, just listen to that description: "The former Democratic governor who was convicted of corruption, who is now a staunch critic of corruption within the Democratic Party." The Onion couldn't dream of writing a headline that ironic.</div>

Stephen Bassett made an extraordinary claim: the E.T.s have lost their patience. According to him, the E.T.'s are pressuring governments to finally disclose their existence.

As many have pointed out, what an incredible time to be alive. Oh, but I forgot—there’s nothing to see here. Just planes and hobbyist drones.

If they are here for multiple hundred or more years, they know us and they understand us. They know how to communicate with us and how to make sure we know they are here! 

So my assumption: They do not care about disclosure and they do their things and they do not care about consequences. 

I think it is just wishful thinking they are care about us.

                        <div class="comment-body">I've been testing it since yesterday, and it's impressive. On some quite complex coding tasks where I got stuck using Gemini 1206 and Sonnet 3.5, DeepSeek offers a fresh perspective, sometimes providing novel solutions not seen by its "elder brothers."

However, it appears to use an outdated dataset and stubbornly attempts to "fix" features of Python 3.11+.

Also, activating DeepThink mode sometimes adds some mess, especially as the context gets longer (though it's sometimes fun to read its "thoughts" and see how it goes off in the wrong direction). So, it often works better without this mode.

And given its likely pricing,.. what a Christmas.</div>

If they can't disprove it, they put it away and do no investigation, that way they can be truthful about having no proof of NHI tech.</div>

I've been quitting and rejoining Instagram repeatedly, seeking a balance between staying connected with friends and avoiding the platform's superficiality.

I'm curious to know: For those who have quit Instagram for an extended period (6 months+), what has your experience been like?

Did you:

- Stay in touch with friends through other means?
- Notice improvements in mental health or productivity?
- Feel like you're missing out on important events or updates?
- Experience any negativ...</div>

Releasing myself from social media’s standards, control and ideas of what “life” should be, what it should “look like” has been relieving in more ways than one. Taking back that control of *my life* and *my time* was the greatest gift I gave myself. Relearning to love myself for all that it is and all that I am, is a fresh beginning</div>

I started a private blog to document my travels, hobbies, life updates etc and post on the 27th of every month. Before I quit insta for good, I shared the blog link with people, giving those who wanted to know what I’m up to the option to subscribe with their email. I was pleasantly surprised to see that most of them did. So they get a funny newsletter from me in their inbox once a month and they get to comment/talk to other mutuals on there. It’s been the best and I haven’t regretted it for a second.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is a myth that $x group has some magical data. And people also greatly misunderstand synthetic data. Everyone is training on pretty much the same data, nearly the entire corpus of the internet. What people mean when they say "quality of data" is just the ability to curate what parts of their dataset are "higher quality" (papers, textbooks, etc) and what's not high quality, and then weighting them correctly. High quality data just means data that's known to be correct and when say a human studies from the data, they will actually learn something correct as opposed to a toddler learning English from just someone that mashed some words together. It's really just a labor intensive process to weed and classify this kind of data, there isn't any magic on it. And accordingly "synthetic data" is 90% of the time BS. And it's nonsensical to use your own models to generate synthetic data. Imagine someone learning English by looking at their own past writing, it doesn't make sense--you're not really improving from it.

More data is really only helpful if it's actually \*novel\* data that's not been seen before substantially on the internet. And people joke about social media platforms, because of dumb comments, broken English and this and that, but actually, that has very little impact... as long as it's coherent (written by a human and can be understood by others), there was some brain work put into constructing those words. And you can still use it as useful training data to reconstruct the neural processes that led to writing those words. And this goes beyond text too, to images and video.</div>
