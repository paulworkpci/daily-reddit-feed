                        <div class="comment-body">Over 3 decades of judo here. I had to stop training due to a neck injury, switched to trail running then CrossFit because I needed a shitload more muscular endurance (as it turns out, 4 minute fights dont need as much as 8 hours running up and down a mountain).  

I got back on the tatami 2 years later and... Everything was so weird. I felt so strong and fast and nearly impossible to exhaust. I had lost a lot in technique but I made up for it so easily just by tiring out my opponent or simply brute forcing them off the ground. Even the progress in flexibility and mobility were hard to ignore. It feels like cheat mode...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">So what's Peter Thiel's whole angle with UFOs and all that woo woo stuff he keeps peddling through guys like Michels and Skywatchers? 🤔

This fucking guy has got his hand all over this "intellectual deep web" of stoner bros and the likes, but I'm not convinced Thiel actually gives a fuck about the Atlantean pyramids and the great continent of Mu, even though his lapdog Michels platforms all of those Hancock/Carlson sort of people. Not to forget him pushing some pseudo-religious agenda of some sort, like a new age UFO cult with a bit of Catholicism on the side.

I'm not really sure what Thiel's end game is. I've read that he's trying to force disclosure to get his hands on the secret tech in the hands of the likes of Boening and Lockheed etc, but does that mean the exotic tech is real then?

What a confusing mess</div>

Then Joe reads the part of the "Big Beautiful Bill" where AI won't be regulated in anyway for at least 10 years, and Michels acts like that's news to him.

It's starting to remind me of the Andreesen episode where he spouted blatant lies about the Bureau of Consumer Protection Bureau freezing assets for political/ideological reasons. This would be worthy of outrage if there was even remotely true.

Rogan seems to present himself as a guy with a finely tuned propaganda detector, and then he continually has these oligarchs and their agents on spewing propaganda - WTF?</div>

It was one of the corniest things I have ever seen and just remembered when Duncan was pushing back against Joe about not listening to Ben Shapiro because he is a dork. 


All these guys are just absolute dorks. That is the best description of them. Weinsteins, Shapiro, Krisin. Top to bottom. Dorks.</div>

This is the problem with tv, Carroll made several claims about Eric’s thesis that simply weren’t true and without having the ability to show the actual paper Eric can’t dispute the claim. In fact, Carroll clearly hadn’t read anything other than the abstract, if he even did that. Several people who actually read Eric’s paper have said Sean is full of shit.

I think his "AI butterfly" theory is his single most obnoxious overly-repeated talking-point to me (right behind the gay pornstar cult). I actually thought it was a cool highdea at first, but he's probably repeated it more than any other theory by now, &amp; I can tell he loves saying it because he thinks he's being "profound" and forward-thinking.</div>

* OpenAI introduced a 200 $/month plan
* Anthropic introduced a 100 $/month plan
* Google just announced a 130 $/month plan

I have been an avid user of both ChatGPT and Anthropic and is scary to see how the rate limit passed from being very good to barely okay once they introduced these new "luxury" plans.

At the moment we have an abundance of open-source LLMs which are almost at the same level of the top private models. T...</div>

There is no way, in the short term, to change that.  Post-singularity we will have fusion power and fully automated factories and whatnot, but until then it is just going to be expensive.

If access for everyone is important then the only answer is to socialize AI.  That doesn't make it less expensive, but it shares the burden among everyone.  I'm not sure if that is the answer or not, but there really isn't anything else.  There's no magic wand here.</div>

Doesn't it make sense that no matter how much open-source software continues advancing, private companies &amp; governments can integrate said advancements into their more vast/performant hardware to stay ahead of the open-source community?

Democratizing AI (through means that don't require the benevolence of companies/governments, although I think that is a viable path) would require building open-architecture (RISC-V, likely) hardware that outperforms NVIDIA's (with CUDA ecosystem), outperforms Google's TPUs, to discourage the need for them. ...Yeah.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah this post is completely moronic. 

The features available on the $200/month plans will be available in the $20 plan next year, and the free plan the year after that. 

Frontier capabilities are expensive, there's nothing wrong with these companies offering them at a premium to people who are willing to pay. With new chips, algorithms and just general optimization it'll get more affordable, and by then there will be some new category of shiny new features wealthy people are happy to spend $1000/month to get access to. 

I'm so tired of this type of economically illiterate pearl clutching.</div>

Each time a nurse or doctor entered the room I asked if I could record … all but one agreed. And there were a hell of a lot of doctors, PAs and various other medical staff checking in. 

I fed the transcripts to ChatGPT and it turned all that conversational gobilygook into meaningful information. There was so much that I had missed while in the moment.

                        <div class="comment-body">I can confirm. I got a cancer diagnosis recently (prostate, so if you have to get cancer, that's the one you want the wheel to land on) and it was really helpful for my various family members to feed my test results and consult summaries from MyChart into ChatGPT and text my family members a GPT-generated summary of the information that made a layman-readable summary of all the doctor-speak.  I DID double-check the info via Google before distributing but I found no fault with what it generated for me.

I'm sure that there's a ton of medical data in Chat's training data so there's not a lot of reason for it to up and start hallucinating if it's basing it's output on medical records (as opposed to someone asking leading questions that cause it to inadvertently hallucinate in order to give that person what he wants to hear).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It does hallucinate medical stuff in my experience. I've worked as a nurse for nearly 20 years, recently left bedside nursing due to health. One of my teammates advocates feeding most of our work through Chatgpt, "even though it's wrong a lot of the time, it gives you a good idea of where you need to start". 

I've tried a couple times and had it coming up with wild stuff, however a layperson with minimal medical knowledge in the first place may not catch where it's gone off the rails or made something up (a couple of times when I've tried using it to summarise some specifically complicated chart/ procedure, say to defend the billing/coding, it has made things up. like full on citing journal articles or regulatory guidances that didn't exist. When confronted, because I couldn't find the reference it cited, it admitted it didn't have access to any of that material- subscriptions required in at least one instance - and had just created information based on it's 'knowledge of the field ')

I'm glad you're able to get confirmation by researching it before passing it's summaries on and it continues to be accurate. Since health information is private and protected information in a lot countries, idk how much actual real world medical data is in its training though</div>

If you start to remove the smaller animals and insects the entire chain falls apart.

Y'all are gonna feel it. Doesn't matter your profession. The wealthy don't prop up the economy. It's the poor people who do, but AI is going to disrupt the poor people first. That'll take everyone else with them.</div>

A few of us are like Meer cats, with a gaze fixed on the horizon looking for threats. We see it, but the rest just can't be bothered. "Nah, it won't affect me", "It'll be ok, we always find a way", etc.

I had a discussion with my parents the other day about Veo 3. They refused to believe that those videos were made by AI.

Most people are going to wake up one day having not payed attention and absolutely freak the f*ck out!

...and blue collar isn't safe either. I hear many trades people living in denial too. The robots are going to take those jobs as well!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">He's absolutely right. One of the things a lot of people don't understand is that the current living conditions and rights in the modern world are not because suddenly "society enlightened", but because the effects of the Industrial Revolution required more educated/skilled workers, and as such the groups of concentrated  power had to offer better living conditions and social mobility to the larger masses of the population so these skilled workers that powered the industries of the industrial revolution could emerge from there.

Now, if you remove that there's no more incentive for these rights and better living conditions anymore, we're back to 10 year old kids working the mines. It will not happen overnight, but society will gradually and ever increasingly deteriorate and move towards that direction. The state in which human society existed for thousands of years. The world of rights and social mobility is something extremely new in human history.

Furthermore, it'll be even worse, because as robotics advance, the mass of the population will also lose that "mob power" leverage that in the past even forced Roman Emperors to at least offer the people "bread and circus" to keep them from storming the palaces.</div>

All the promises about Tesla vehicles taking over the world and justifying the stock valuation are forgotten. Now it's all about the next grift. I don't think Elon cares much about what happens to the original car business.


I do think Trump &amp; co just took advantage of him. Musk might've been serious about doing the DOGE stuff, but it's pretty obvious this administration had no intention of following thru with any even somewhat painful reforms. Mostly ended up being a social media campaign "owning the libs". </div>

Agencies Investigating or Regulating Musk’s Companies Targeted by DOGE

	1.	National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA):

	NHTSA, responsible for vehicle safety and previously involved in investigations into Tesla’s Autopilot system, experienced significant staff reductions.

	Approximately 10% of its workforce was cut, including personnel specializing in autonomous vehicle safety, following DOGE-led initiatives.  ￼

	2.	Federal Aviation Administration (FAA):

	The FAA, which regulates aerospace activities and had fined SpaceX over $600,000 for license violations, saw leadership changes and increased DOGE involvement.

	Musk was granted access to FAA technologies for “rapid safety upgrades,” prompting concerns about conflicts of interest given SpaceX’s regulatory interactions with the FAA.  ￼

	3.	Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):

	The SEC, which had previously settled a securities fraud case with Musk, faced staffing reductions under DOGE’s direction.

      Employees were offered buyouts, potentially impacting the agency’s capacity to enforce regulations related to Musk’s companies.  ￼

	4.	National Labor Relations Board (NLRB):

	The NLRB, handling labor disputes including cases against Tesla and SpaceX, encountered attempts by DOGE to cancel leases and reduce operational capacity.

	These actions could impede the board’s ability to process labor complaints involving Musk’s companies.  ￼

	5.	Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):

	The CFPB, which had received numerous consumer complaints about Tesla, underwent leadership changes and operational shutdowns under DOGE’s influence.

	Musk publicly advocated for the agency’s elimination, aligning with DOGE’s actions to curtail its functions.

	6.	Food and Drug Administration (FDA):

	FDA staff involved in reviewing Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company, were reportedly dismissed during DOGE-led cuts.

	This raised concerns about the impartiality of regulatory oversight for Neuralink’s clinical trials.</div>

I tried getting it to write a backstory for a D&amp;D character, I had some bullet points I wanted it to use. But ended up hating the flow of the story and the weird details it would add. It felt like all the prompts I ended up using to get it fixed I might as well have just written the outline myself.

 I ended up liking that end product much more. It was a lot better at fixing what I'd made. Using better transitions, fixing overused phrases or words, adding descriptions. Also great for spitballing ideas for making up names.</div>

Had the most crippling anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, almost like an emptiness.

It got worse and worse, my emotions became numb. I got chronic fatigue, life became unbearable.

I eventually took some time out of work last year for 8 months and started trying to understand myself more and heal.

Fast forward and I’ve been at this for a year now. I’ve seen some improvements, my emotions are very slowly c...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Anxiety comes from the mind's attachment to control. Do you agree?

In any situation where you don't know what will happen and have no control over events, anxiety arises. And then every attempt to control anxiety generates more anxiety because the mind wants to have control over being anxious and can't, and without having control, more anxiety arises and this creates a self-feeding cycle.

So when you meditate with the intention of reducing anxiety, what are you actually doing? You are exactly training your mind in a type of exercise to have control over anxiety! And this doesn't work because you are making the same mistake that anxiety arises from: meditating to control anxiety is still the same anxious mind trying to have control and that is what generates anxiety...

So, what to do?
Abandon the idea of ​​having control. You have no control over anything.

In meditation practice, this translates as just sitting and letting whatever happens happen.

In everyday life, stop trying to predict what will happen, just stay with what is happening.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey man, it really does get better with time.
I’ve also been dealing with anxiety—mainly from smoking weed. I used to smoke like 4 times a day for almost 4 years straight. Finally quit last October and haven’t touched it since. That alone made a big difference.

On top of that, some people I’ve known since childhood turned their backs on me and showed their true colors. That kind of betrayal hits deep, but it also helps you see who’s really meant to stay in your life.

What’s been helping me lately:

Doing breathing exercises or meditation for 15–30 minutes every morning and evening

Cold showers (they suck at first but really help)

Going for walks outside and working out

Reading good books that shift my mindset

And honestly, journaling. Just writing stuff down—what happened during the day, how I felt physically and emotionally, what I liked or didn’t like. It’s like taking out the mental trash so it doesn’t pile up.


&gt; Meditation alone won’t fix anxiety. It helps, but it’s not magic. You’ve got to combine it with other habits that support your body and mind.



One last thing: don’t try to fight or escape anxiety. Don’t fear it. Try to accept it as a natural part of you, like, “yeah, this is me right now.” The more you stop resisting it, the less power it has.

You got this, bro. Seriously. Don’t give up.

Ps : I used Chatgpt to detail this text, cuz english is not my first language. Again, good luck. How old are you?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Read the book : The power of Now by Eckhart Tole...NOW... Depression and anxiety... Two things we hear so much about now, but nobody understands it. As explained in the book: you are in the NOW, while your brain or mental is looking at the future, possible scenarios, potential dangers. This create a gap between  now and the future that the brain is struggling to fill. Same thing with depression but with the past. I read that book like 3,4 times. You need that book, you can get it in the app store or google play. I bought physical copies in both english and my first language. Even offered it as a gift for my brother on Christmas. Come home to the present moment, every moment is a present waiting for your full attention. Real talk.

Edit:  get the audio book too, tole's voice is so soothing.</div>

I used:

This reads like someone's job application cover letter mixed in with "generic social media post". No one actually writes like this. "As a blah blah blah", really? And you're going to quantify how much AI replaces you?

                                <div class="reply-body">The issue here is the rules for what does and doesn't need 60 votes in the Senate. The current reconciliation bill CAN'T be done in multiple bills because of the Senate rules. To split it up would mean each part needs 60 votes and would be blocked by the Democrats, so this is really the only way for them to get around the rules and pass these things without Democrat votes. 

In other words, the hyper-partisan nature of Congress and inefficient rules in Congress is what causes these bills. This is the same for when Democrats are in power as well in which case it's the opposite. Without a supermajority, these kinds of bills become the norm since neither side wants to work with the other for political reasons. Every politician, above anything else, cares only about consolidating power in the next election. They will happily sabatoge the other side if it means they can retake power in the next election.

It's also worth mentioning, that even *within* the parties there are splits in opinion. Ex) Bernie Sanders populism and moderate Democrats on the left, and MAGA and traditional conservative republicans on the right. So even *within* the parties concessions have to be made to get a majority, adding to the size of the bill. SALT deductions for Republicans in Blue States being an example here in this bill, with Red State Republicans being against them.</div>

In a groundbreaking advance, scientists have successfully used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to eliminate HIV-1 DNA from the genomes of human immune cells. Unlike existing treatments that suppress the virus, this method completely removes the genetic blueprint of HIV from infected T-cells.

In lab tests using cells from real patients, not only was the virus removed, but the edited cells also resisted reinfect...</div>

CCR5 gene controls the mechanism HIV uses to enter and infect a cell. People lacking it are functionally immune to HIV. 

But that is not an elegant cure. 

This cure is far better, done within ethical oversight. Instead of eliminating CCR5, they cut HIV genetic code out of the cells entirely, offering a true cure that also repairs the human genome back to what it was before being infected.

I had a funny thought reading this article. All these antivaxxers that claimed the mRNA shot "changes your DNA" and they thought it safer to risk getting the virus. I wonder if they realize that viruses actually do change your DNA.</div>

My job, and the job of 90% of my coworkers could be replaced by AI as it stands currently. There is a 0% chance that my company is going to do that. There are barriers to entry, costs, time, customer understanding/goodwill. 

Moreover, incorporating such cutting edge tech is a colossal risk. We've been using human labour for thousands and thousands of years. Replacing that overnight with experimental tech is a scary prospect. And with such new tech that has the possibility of causing social upheaval, there's the risk of government legislation changing how we're allowed to use it. 

If my company, tomorrow, replaced 90% of it's workers with AI (this assumes we get the hardware and software perfectly implemented instantly) a huge amount of our customers get confused and shop elsewhere. Also in 2 years, the government may begin taxing or regulating against the use of AI to protect citizens against the potential social upheaval that's coming. That's a huge risk that could END the business.</div>

Man if you need a drain unclogged before 2027, you might have to wait, but after, you will have your pick, and cheap too! They might just work for food! Seriously we need to be writing our legislators now about this. If all white collar work is automated that quickly, UBI and automation tax is the only way I see forward. We need love and compassion and not the typical attitude toward welfare. The dotcom and internet and the invent of personal computers started a white collar revolution. Our world thrives on white collar work, In The USA 57.8% of the workforce is white collar. We have a lot of users on this sub. I think it’s pertinent to start the ball rolling.

There will be only a handful countries able to roll out UBI, at least theoretically. Now imagine what happens in a country like India when suddenly hundreds of thousands of people who worked for Western companies suddenly lose their jobs.

AI won't only wreck the domestic job market in the US, but it will totally obliterate jobs in other countries, without any options to offset this.</div>

You're spot on. This is probably the only objectively true take when it comes to AI use in software development.

Nobody will deny you can absolutely "vibe code" something with zero software building experience. But there is absolutely a limit to how complex your app can be, and how far AI will take you. The truth is, to really unlock the power of AI you need to be just as big an expert as it to reach peak collaborative efficiency.

AI in the hands of a talented engineer with strong technical skills is a stupidly powerful force that is often an exponential force multiplier.</div>

junior dev getting good with AI tools

using Claude Code and Roo

actually shipping projects faster than ever

still doing the hard thinking and architecture but AI handles the grunt work

feeling pretty good about my progress

browse reddit during lunch break

see post: "They lied to you. Building software is really hard"

mfw the author probably used AI to write this anti-AI article

article quality suggests they didn't use it very well

realize I just got clickbaited by someone complaining about tools that are literally making my job better

check source: "The Nordcraft Blog"

never heard of it, probably some random dev's medium clone

turns out to be a SaaS "web development engine" product blog for a company that seems to have an agenda

tfw you waste 5 minutes reading someone's business blog hot take disguised as wisdom

go back to coding with my "cheating" AI tools

ship features, make money, sleep well

maybe the real lie was the clickbait we read along the way</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">People that don't know how to build software think it's about writing code. It is, but not really.

It's about solving problems for humans. And AI doesn't understand humans like other humans do. It can build stuff that works very well objectively, but humans don't work like that.

For example: I recently had to migrate a project from .NET 6 to .NET 8. A junior or AI would probably assume this would be the perfect moment to deal with technical debt, make big improvements and fix certain stuff. Why not you'd think?

Because customers can have their entire business depend on whatever very specific quirks your software used to have and now that you 'fixed' them you just gave your customers a whole lot of work and pissed them off.

So just because a piece of software looks good on the outside and on a technical level doesn't mean you are creating value.</div>
