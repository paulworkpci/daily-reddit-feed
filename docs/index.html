I made something similar, but as a bash script that emulates an irc chat room with many different llms joined in, and optionally the human too.  All using Ollama local models, no external api calls.  https://github.com/attogram/llm-council</div>

                <div class="post-content">I see so many people thinking they are *failing* if they get distracted or think during meditation. As long as you gently return to your anchor of focus when you get distracted, you **are** meditating. (In object-based meditation)

In fact, I find the idea of failiure in meditation totally unhelpful. There is nothing as draining and exhausting as an overly strict meditation practice.

What is another key issue that is important to be aware of in meditation?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Another key issue would be the slew of people who believe they are just “watching” their thoughts when in reality they are just engaging with them like they always do. Thinking you are failing because you are having thoughts while meditating is bad, but also thinking you are succeeding without identifying thoughts and redirecting focus is equally bad.

It doesn’t matter if you have thoughts, but as soon as you stop attempting to redirect your focus from them, you’ve stopped meditating. Measure yourself by how well you stick to this, not by how many thoughts arise.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You may hear MAGAs claim Ivana recanted her story. This is categorically false.

Her alleged retraction did not change one single word of her account. Not even the word "rape". She does, however, very strangely state that she didn't mean rape in a "criminal sense".

Interesting choice of words, in light of Fat Donny's recent statements, isn't it?

And in light of his lawyer's old statements: "You cannot rape your spouse. And there’s very clear case law." (spoiler: He was wrong)

What could it all mean?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It looks like a mini F80. Lots of classic throwbacks. It doesn't look very classy at first glance through. Very incoherent.

On a second glance, the mid section just looks like it was lifted from a SF90 and a boxier front and rear were just tacked on. Not super coherent. I know it's basically a facelifted SF90 but they should have worked on that section a bit more.

I like the rear end on the spider when it's viewed from the side. It shows a bit of Daytona SP3 at the wheel haunches which I really like. The lifted wing elements are meh.

The spider in the yellow looks much better. Not sure why but the red coupe looks so damn incoherent. I know the SF90 was hated for being too bland at launch but in hindsight it did look a lot more coherent.

Edit: Yeah I used the word incoherent a lot. Aptly describes the car I suppose.</div>

I thought it would end at the 12Cilindri as it was related to the Daytona in terms of design so it was kinda understandable but I don't like that they have added it to the F80 and the new Testarossa.</div>

The front is giving F40 vibes, the sides resemble the SF90, but the rear is giving full on Alfa Romeo Disco Volante style cues.

The Spider does flow much better without the roofline. Makes me think they just adapted the convertible for the coupe.</div>

If this took like a couple of decades due to some technolocial ceiling, that wouldn't have bothered anyone, but we kind of cracked reality code here and it evolves on a quarterly basis. I would really love to study Java but I can't feel but think that this is a cooked direction, in 5 years you will need only senior class developers and that's it. Nobody wirites the code manually nowadays day after day. I have no idea what to do.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There's a non-paywalled article from Reuters here: https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-use-some-ai-anthropic-shift-openai-information-reports-2025-09-09/


Some notable excerpts:


&gt;Microsoft will pay its cloud rival Amazon Web Services to access the Anthropic models, according to the report.

&gt;Developers making Office AI features found Anthropic's latest models performed better than OpenAI in automating tasks such as financial functions in Excel or generating Powerpoint presentations based on instructions

I think this is a pretty shocking move. There has been talking about cracks in the Microsoft/OpenAI relationship but this seems like a major schism.


They're going to pay another cloud/AI competitor rather than use the model they effectively get at-cost? Is GPT really that much worse for this task?</div>

Not even to mention starting to show Apple hardware in their presentations instead of Microsoft.

The previous articles reporting on the deterioration of the OAI/Microsoft relationship have mentioned that OpenAI is doing anything they can to become independent of Microsoft, which explains much of their recent behavior.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That girl happens to be Virginia Giuffre who’s publicly accused Prince Andrew and Trumps lawyer, Alan Durshowitz. She also conveniently “commited suicide” in Australia right before these latest scandals, and her family says they don’t believe she killed herself. She previously stated she was “in no way, shape, or form suicidal”

                        <div class="comment-body">I read the entire paper. First off, yes it's legit - biggest research org in the world publishing in a top tier journal. The findings suggest a major advance in anti-aging therapies in primates. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies have been tested in primates before, but this study introduced genetic (FOXO3) modification to the MSCs in order to make them resistant to cellular senescence. Long story short: they found plenty of evidence supporting systemic amelioration of aging (more than I care to summarize) with minimal side effects over 44 weeks of bi-weekly infusions. They also explicitly state in the discussion that they had the following objectives:  (1) developing a universal, shelf-ready human stem cell product with enhanced safety and anti-aging efficacy. (2) Establishing a quantitative comprehensive assessment tool for primate multi-organ aging and its interventions. (3) Charting a translational medicine roadmap for future human aging interventions.</div>

Started r/ShipOrDie \- you must include deployed URL/screenshots/proof or get deleted. Doesn't matter the stage or how "good" it is, we just want to see you ship.

Vibecoders don't lack creativity but as I notice, they lack accountability. Maybe a community for us tho are too lazy to finish a product, and only for that, would benefit everyone.

I just got them made this year and for multi day festivals it’s life changing. You can still talk and have conversations, you can hear the highs/mids/lows. Way better than anything you can find online, including loop, etc. they can even change the inserts in them which change the attenuation factor (mine have 3 levels of reduction) and I use the middle one currently. 

I think they cost around $100-$150</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It looks “too professional” though. Like the angle, lighting, and detail is way “too good”. Even if you take the same camera as the prompt and then take the picture on your own, I can guarantee you’ll likely “miss something”, can be lighting, exposure, or even simply setting up the scene.

Not necessarily a bad thing, but this is one way you can spot it.</div>

Why would you take this photo with that shutter speed?

I mean seriously what are the chances it was a coincidence. In the beginning i thought it was the covid vaccine ...</div>

I was taking a required math course in a fashion college in a major city, some easy extra income i guess. So this man was very, very bored teaching uninterested folk about basic math, in a way that was designed to be unfailable basically. Point being when there was any opportunity to have any sort of stimulating conversation, he lept on it. Any slight interest in him or anything was a big deal to this man. One day he was describing the research he was doing at the other university he worked at. He was describing that he had a computer they were working on that was sensitive to brain wave outputs from a distance, and was essentially able to read minds. He said it wasn't like you were able to pick up images and words, and I dont recall what he described exactly anymore, it freaked me out at a point in my life when I was spiraling really bad. This was in 2011. The technology has existed for over a decade. Im sure its been honed by now.</div>

How advertising works is that you are shown many ads for a product, and most of them will not make enough of an impact for you to notice them on a conscious level. When you finally think consciously about the product, after being shown ads for it many times(without noticing the ads), then you will start noticing ads for it, and it can feel like your phone is reading your mind. Some people are far more susceptible to advertising than others, for a myriad of reasons, and they are also more susceptible to the phenomenon you describe.</div>
