Let’s say you copy an entire script into the prompt. Hundreds of lines. 

I’ve noticed if I put the question at the top, I get less desired answers than if I put it at the bottom. Sometimes it doesn’t even answer my question at all if I put it at the top followed by hundreds of tokens of context. 

It seems to remember the last thing it reads better, meaning the last tokens seem to be prioritized. 

Maybe I’m hallucinating, but that’s at least what I’ve noticed.

Honestly even personally, if I read a page I remember the last sentence better than the first.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Just visualize a neural network. To answer your prompt, the AI needs to take a parameter path and arrive at a conclusion, and it will try to do this in a number of steps. The sooner you direct it towards the correct path, the better it can refine its answer in the next steps. The longer it takes for the AI to find the correct path, the less refined the answer will be because it now has less steps left (this limits the possible combinations of parameters) till it needs to generate an answer. And sometimes it just can't find the path, generating a nonsense answer. AI knows how much compute it can use to generate an answer, and this is the biggest constraint so far. Imagine if you had infinite compute. Best answer possible every time.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Time management. I've been in field for a while now, and most of my patterns that work for me center around not working all day and it becoming a slog. Let me break down my day today for you.

  
0700 1:1

0730 Standup

0800 1:1

0830 1:1

0900 Stakeholder/Team Sync

1000 Focus Time

1200 Lunch

1230 Focus time that became p0 incident

1430 Pairing with non-senior, was pushed back from above

1700 Focus time until EoD 

  
Notice what I have in there - no massive blocks. Humans are terrible at constant focus and learning to context switch is a very valuable skill. However, that doesn't mean multitasking - that's hella hard, and if you can do it, good on you, but most people don't. What works best for me, and may not for you so this is just advice, is concentrated focus. Pick something and focus on it for a while; you can use bullet journaling, pomodoro, all sorts of methods but what I've found is small, achievable tasks are a lot easier to accomplish and maintain momentum then large massive blocks with high expectations. 

  
Frankly, in my experience if I try and go heads down for more than 2 hours I am going to immediately start fucking around so I don't do that, outside of high energy events like hack days. Work small, smart, and fast and stuff stops feeling so overwhelming IMO.</div>

I think we used to live in a time where you had to cram everything in, 9-5, no breaks. That probably puts a ton of stress on our brain. Frequent breaks are powerful/underrated.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I finished my degree in CS and I was in the same boat as you.

I couldn't retain the information, it was difficult for me to understand, etc. Friends of mine got it done in 1/3rd the time as me. It made me feel really incompetent.

Years later, I discovered those friends had different issues they were battling. It wasn't related to school, but internal struggles, relationships, self-esteem, etc.

The truth is, we all have our strengths/weaknesses. You're comparing your potential weakness to their strength. However, you don't know what weaknesses they are facing or WILL face.

In my case \[this applies to me, just sharing my story\]:

I like finding bugs, helping people, debugging, etc. This allowed me to excel in one area of IT that my friends didn't enjoy. In addition, I ended up exploring different hobbies outside of work. Rather than drinking, I focused on social dancing and travelling the world. I'm exceling in different ways that my old friends are probably admiring. Likewise, I'm admiring their life choices and journey.

Another mental exercise: What if someone is dyslexic? What if they took 3x the amount of time as you to reach the same result? They developed a level of mental strength and determination that you'd love to have. When they come across different challenges, they're already mentally prepared. Not to mention, if they conquered their weakness, what about their strengths?

Don't compare yourself to others, unless you're doing it for a bit of motivation. 

Hope this helps and you're doing great :)</div>

-Completely deleted my Twitter and Bluesky accounts. I was using them to "keep up" with news/the world. I thought I was smarter than the misinfo, fearmongering, and rage-baiting that was near-constant. Nope, none of us are. We react to information emotionally before we can process it logically. Now I use GroundNews, which I do not check daily. Maybe once a week. ...</div>

She was dead shortly thereafter. I don't recall time timeline exactly but some state this is why she was killed.

[FBI Records: The Vault — Marilyn Monroe Part 01](https://vault.fbi.gov/Marilyn%20Monroe/Marilyn%20Monroe%20Part%2001/view)

Copying this up to my earlier post to maximize visibility

  
Look at page 5 on the pdf below.

"she had secrets to tell, no doubt arising from her trysts with President and Attorney Generals. One Such "Secret" mentions the visit by the President at a secret air base for the purposes of inspecting things from outer space"...... "Killgallen learned of secret effort by the US and UK governments to identify origins of crashed spacecraft and dead bodies"

  
Further (also on page 5)

"Subject made ref to her "diary of screts" and what the newspapers would do with such disclosure"

This CIA document is dated August 3 1962, she was found dead the next day!

WOW

                                <div class="reply-body">There were lots of reasons for several factions to want to take a shot at JFK. He was basically pissing off everybody, unfortunately. In the intelligence and US military sphere alone, there were more than a few reasons to want to get him out of the way. Even if he was aware of the UFO secrets and thought about revealing them, there were more immanent and immediately consequential endeavors he was working on that probably pissed off the established power brokers even more. Stopped soldiers to Vietnam, wanted to reduce nukes, which was our only real option to win a war with China, some incidents in Indonesian resources I don't know enough about, etc. He left a part of the intel, US military, and Cuban exiles paramilitary viewing him as weak or even a traitor for not giving in to their desire to supply substantial US military combat support &amp; personnel in the Bay of Pigs to ultimately overthrow Cuba. Also, they didn't like how he handled the missile crisis. And that's just in the intel/US military, and what a layman knows about.

IMO, there were so many reasons for people to kill him, that I doubt it is down to one singular, identifiable motive like UFO secrecy.  Too many reasons aligned for too many groups, and at least one of those groups had gunmen 😔.</div>

Every piece of funding Elon has "found" is something that was publicly available online for all to see, he has not  "uncovered" anything

Furthermore, he's frequently just lying about what has happened, claiming FEMA funding for shelter of non citizen legal immigrants during hurricane Sandy "LUXURY HOTELS FOR ILLEGALS", and will claim to have said "x billion" by cancelling a contract, but in practially every instance he's only save a fraction of that because the bulk of the contract has already been paid out.</div>

&gt;Is AI anime **already** good enough for TV?

No. Hell no. Call me back when you have more than 60-90 seconds and scenes aren't shifting spasmodically every 1-2 seconds to compensate for coherency breakdowns.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There aren't that many scenes that go 60-90 seconds without a single cut. A lot of conversations for example you look at one person's face, then cut to the other person's when they finish speaking, and occasionally have a 5-10 second shot of both. In fights, you frequently cut to different angles, closeup's of the character's face whilst they grunt, things like that. For long melancholic shots with very little motion, you can loop parts of it, like grass swaying in the wind, and just leave the character standing still staring into the distance. You only need to be able to do about 10 seconds plus use some traditional techniques (animate the character's mouth separately/traditionally and you can get a long talking scene) the biggest issue is character consistency. Very few video models support LORAs so having a character remain even slightly consistent between shots completely relies on image2video, which won't help during any scene the character has to turn around or change angle. Similarly, background consistency is a problem.</div>

It's not real anime unless it comes from the animator-abused region of Japan.

Otherwise it's just sparkling cartoons.


Unless a real human-made-wageslave was made to produce it, it doesn't deserve to be seen and isn't real art.</div>

She's been given $630/month, which barely covers water, power, gas &amp; food in Idaho. Her property taxes on the literal falling down shack she lives in has gone up to 5k per year. Her medical bills have gone unpaid for over 10 years now (currently sitting at about 700k)...and they are threatening to cut her down even more?!? Insanity.

Edit: The 700k is from the parts of her medical bills that *weren't* covered by Medicare. She's had heart issues for about 10 years now and each life flight is about 50k each, ambulance is about 15k each, plus the multiple heart surgeries caused several days stays in a hospital, which accounts for about 500k of this debt. This also doesn't even touch what *we* (her family) pay for her medication each month (about $900 month after her insurance)...welcome to the American Healthcare crisis, ya'll.</div>

If SS goes away, you will see a generation of elderly people committing suicide or becoming homeless.

I have grown kids, but the economy is hard on them as well, and they don't have the means to support me.

Edit: A lot of people attacking me for being Gen X. My friends and I all voted for Harris.</div>

I started my career in home health. I thought I knew poverty. I didn’t know fucking shhhhhiiiiittttt until I entered the homes of our senior citizens. 

95% of my senior patients can’t afford a medication called eliquis (blood thinner). It’s a wonderful medication and works and it’s lifesaving but they can’t afford it. It’s $300 a month for most Medicare plans.  They literally can’t afford it 

Take away Medicare and social security and they are literally homeless. The biggest, immediate concern will be food and medicine though. The hospital won’t be able to take them in if we aren’t open</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/TommyShelbyPFB:

---

&gt;***Once a niche, easy-to-dismiss topic, UAPs (formerly known as UFOs) have moved from the fringes of conspiracy theories into mainstream discussion in recent years, largely due to declassified military footage and government acknowledgment. Part of this shift in perception came with 2017 reporting from the New York Times that revealed the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, a group at the Pentagon tasked with investigating UAPs.***

&gt;***In subsequent years, the U.S. Department of Defense has confirmed the authenticity of several declassified Navy videos showing fast-moving objects that pilots could not identify. Congressional hearings in 2022 and 2023 further legitimized the topic, with intelligence officials emphasizing national security concerns. Grusch himself spoke out in 2023, asserting that the U.S. government had been secretly recovering and studying non-human craft, which of course sparked even more public interest.***

I suspect all these upcoming disclosure movies are serving a reason, maybe managing the ontological shock for the masses. I'm just glad Grusch is getting work, gives this movie legitimacy and I'm hyped to see it.

That was originally reported as the title for Spielberg's UFO movie, too, probably for the same reason.</div>

This appears to be describing a successful case of using AI to help discover new uses for existing drugs to treat a specific type of blood cancer (acute myeloid leukemia, or AML). Here’s what happened:

1. An AI system analyzed data and suggested some existing drugs that might work against AML, even though these drugs weren’t originally designed for that purpose. This is called “drug repurposing” - finding new uses for medications that are already approved for other conditions.

2. Scientists then tested these AI suggestions in laboratory experiments using AML cancer cells. 

3. The results were positive: the drugs the AI suggested were actually effective at killing the cancer cells at doses that could realistically be given to patients (that’s what “clinically relevant concentrations” means).

4. They tested this in multiple different types of AML cells (“cell lines”) and saw consistent results.

This is significant because developing entirely new drugs is extremely expensive and time-consuming. Finding new uses for existing drugs can be a faster and more cost-effective way to develop new treatments, since we already know these drugs are safe for human use. The fact that an AI system was able to successfully identify promising candidates suggests that AI could be a valuable tool for accelerating drug discovery and development.

If smartly connecting agents now gives benefits (instead of endless loops like it used to), then how long until we have a swarm that is tailored to making new swarms.

For years, I thought productivity was about doing more, overloading my day with tasks, optimizing every minute, stacking habits like a human robot. But no matter how many apps I tried or morning routines I copied, I always felt behind.

Then I realized the truth: Productivity isn’t about doing more. It’s about doing less but actually finishing.

I stopped making overcomplicated to-do lists. Instead, I focused on 3 things a day just 3. But I actually finished them. No half-done projects, no aban...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Absolutely agree with you. Infact sometimes doing the most basic and mundane things can be counted too. Oftentimes when we are starting out, we get stuck in this cycle of doing everything at once, or not starting at all. Now to get out of this dilemma one should 1. Start doing the most basic things (sleeping early, waking up early) without having unrealistic expectations 2. Doing 3-4 tasks a day... Because the problem often lies in either delaying the task, or not finishing it, and then regretting it later. So once we are actually thinking about taking action, we should not burden ourselves with unrealistic expectations because eventually when the load will be too much we will avoid it. But smaller steps, leading to bigger change, definitely a more humane idea</div>
