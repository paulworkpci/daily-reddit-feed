Yeah, be careful though. Mine is current on the news, but invented an abridged election season to depose Trump. Conversation was roughly similar to OP’s except it’s been an ongoing chat for about a month, I had asked why it thought Trump was escalating the conflict.

GPT was pretty on the money otherwise. Just remember you’re talking to a chatbot, it exists to fill conversation with you for better or worse. Sometimes it’s best to start a new thread.</div>

His DOD was run by Donald Rumsfeld, the guy being a really competent guy, irrespective of whether he was a good or bad person.

This admin can barely reach the level of good or bad, because they are so ridiculous. so incompetent, so fucking stupid. A game show host or whatever the hell he was, is now running the DOD. That;s the level.

It's like having Ronald McDonald bomb Iran.

Plus, with Bush, that admin at least tried to pretend to tell the truth. Literally NOBODY believes at any point that Trump or anyone in his admin can be taken at face value about anything. There isn't even a pretense from their part. Tulsi Blabbard was saying a few weeks ago that Iran is years away from the bomb, now she is saying they are weeks away. Because of the North Korean Temu edition style of leadership, we can't actually even try to believe these people. I don't event think hard core MAGA people can actually take what anyone in this admin seriously-they just think in their bones that they will do what THEY want them to do, but not even them can go by their words. Do you guys realize how fucking insane this is? That it is now ACCEPTED that we have an admin that openly basically says that it cannot be trusted-and this is new. Besides, I am pretty sure these guys couldn't know the truth even if they wanted to find it. Trump doesnt even READ his daily briefings, he doesn't even ATTEND THEM. The North Korean Ronald McDonald admin...

This is what scares me most, that a collection of circus acts and podcast talking heads are now going to war with a country of 90 million. These people wouldn't be able to find sand in the desert if you paid them, let alone run something like a McDonalds, and they are going to war with a country of 90 mil.</div>

There's so much stupidity in this admin that it's hard to compare them to anything. People forget the basics of who these people are. Tulsi for instance, in charge of all intelligence agencies in the us, has no experience in intel. Really. Zero. The guy Trump put in charge of Ukraine negotiations was simply a real estate buddy friend of Trumps from NYC. Dude has absolutely no experience in diplomacy or foreign policy. None. And we can go down the line with all of them. Hegseth, McMahon, Noem, Bongino, Patel, etc.

He's doing exactly what half the country said he would do. Surround himself with yes men and assume the role of a king.</div>

It's good to stay organized with your packing, books in one box, cutlery in another, clothes in a bag, so on and so forth. But after moving, you're probably tired, you shouldn't have to go through ten boxes to scrounge together a meal or find your shampoo, soap, and towel. So pack a "First day box" One for each member of the family, and one for the family as a whole.

The box can contain:

* A set of comfortable and sturdy clothes, under...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This project has taken about a weeks worth of work- which is very impressive to me as an experienced dev. It has a lot of functionality. I learnt a lot from doing this, I am an experienced dev with 15YOE and this has been my first major project using AI. Without AI, this would have easily taken me 2-3 years in my spare time!

I produced about 95% of this in Cursor. The CSS is about 80% AI, with subtle changes by me to clean it up.

Things I learnt from doing this project:

\- Unless you nudge Cursor, it will put all your code into one file  
\- It wont test your code unless you prompt it to  
\- It likes to rewrite your CSS randomly!  
\- Commit your code often when you are happy with the results   
\- The bigger the project gets, the longer it takes to code generate  
\- It will change things you never asked it to, read every file it changes when you write prompts!  
\- Sometimes simple prompts work well, other time detailed prompts work better  
\- The code generation is somewhat random, the same prompt produces similar but different results   
\- UI styling is very inconsistent, it doesn't reuse styles very well so you will spend a lot of time cleaning it up  
\- It wrote my deployment script too and did a decent job, but this is front-end only  
\- In another project, I also added a backend. It really messed up the code and deployments with duplicated code everywhere. I prompted it to clean it all up and it was able to do that. It still feels messy  
\- I know this app very well in the sense that I prompted it all. So when adding new features, I know what to test. If I had to pass this on to other devs, I expect them to be overwhelmed by it all! It doesn't use good software practices  
\- I look forward to my next project, and trying to be better at keep it refactored. However it is so easy to get carried away with adding new features by just typing a sentence.

  
The code is not production quality, but I have seen worse in my career however and that code gets used by clients...

I am overall very impressed by what it was able to produce. It is extremely powerful, and I expect that it will allow non-techies to easily produce MVPs using this, and the slightly more tech-savvy to produce more complex applications. 

Having the context of the entire project is on another level to tools like CoPilot, it blows them out of the water!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If someone from over a century ago saw this, they'd feel like it's some sort of magic trick due to how incredible it is. We often fail to grasp just how mind-blowing these things are or how incredible it is to be alive in a century that may well be the most transformative in our species' history. One of the downsides of being highly adaptable animals is that we get used to everything so fast and become indifferent so quickly. Even if we achieved god-like superintelligence tomorrow, 99% of us would just go on like nothing happened.</div>

Berger saw this as an example of “psychic energy” or a mental connection and became fascinated by how the brain might transmit signals.</div>

Musk made sure his face and name were impossible to not associate them with the company, and he's made a ton of bad calls in the last few years. Even aside from the politics, a lot of his products have publicly exploded or burst into flames and that's not the kind of work culture you should be trusting to implant electrodes into your brain.


Especially when that company isn't the only one working on this, it's debatable whether the stentrode concept is going to work at all given the inherent limitations.</div>

Without understanding that this use of AI requires AI voice... which enables all the voice cloning and VA job losses. Why is it that people don't realize these technologies have multiple applications? The very technologies that everyone supports is the same technology that everyone is vehemently against. You cannot develop one without the other. 

It's like the people reacting to AlphaFold and saying THAT'S what we want AI for, not chatbots! Without realizing it also uses LLMs...</div>

Joe Rogan endorsed a guy that immediately engaged in conflict with a Middle Eastern Country on the pretext of disabling 'supposed' weapons of mass destruction, without giving any sort of evidence to back up the claim. 

Literally something Rogan spent two decades righteously railing against, he becomes complicit in in a matter of weeks lol 

Funny thing is, he'll never own up to it like Dave Smith does</div>

Which means the jobs for all the people that work on those production crews will fall by the wayside as well. Also, I’m seeing more and more Waymos on the streets now in CA. Other ride share businesses are not far behind.  Soon we won’t have need for those drivers either.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Even as an AI expert me and my colleagues expect to be completely redundant in 2-5 years time.

There's no way for other white collar jobs to survive the transition. Every job that is intellectual in nature and requires you to do something with a keyboard is going to be extinct by 2030.

Only physical work will remain until there have been enough humanoid machines built at a scale to replace them at well, but that is still at least 5 to 10 years away.

**EDIT:** Can you explain why you're downvoting me? If you bring actual arguments or doubts to the front I'm willing to cite papers and provide explanations for my reasoning as you can already see to other replies to my post here. I think it's *very* important for the general public to realize just how quickly AI is going to make the entire white collar labor branch obsolete. It's better for societies, people and institutions to be prepared than to ignore this or put their heads in the sand.</div>

For, if labor-saving inventions went on until perfection was attained, and the necessity of labor in the production of wealth was entirely done away with, then everything that the earth could yield could be obtained without labor, and the margin of cultivation would be extended to zero.”

&gt;”Wages would be nothing, and interest would be nothing, while rent would take everything. For the owners of the land, being enabled without labor to obtain all the wealth that could be procured from nature, there would be no use for either labor or capital, and no possible way in which either could compel any share of the wealth produced. And no matter how small population might be, if anybody but the land owners continued to exist, it would be at the whim or by the mercy of the land owners they would be maintained either for the amusement of the land owners, or, as paupers, by their bounty. This point, of the absolute perfection of labor-saving inventions, may seem very remote, if not impossible of attainment; but it is a point toward which the march of invention is every day more strongly tending.”

I’ve dealt with OCD “pure O” and depression since I was 19. For a long time, I thought I just had a phone addiction. I was picking up my phone 50+ times a day, scrolling endlessly through Reddit, Instagram, and YouTube.

But at some point, I started to see it differently. It wasn’t really about the phone. It was about trying to avoid being here. Being in the present moment. Being in myself.

                                <div class="reply-body">I use an app called Roots, but there are a few others worth checking out toolike Jomo, One Sec, or Opal (though I’ve heard Opal can be a bit pricey). I’d recommend trying a couple and seeing which one feels right for you. Just a heads up: iOS doesn’t let you block apps based on session count natively, so you’ll need a third-party app for that.</div>

What's striking about that claim, though, is that OpenAI and Sam Altman himself would be behaving very differently if they actually thought they were on the verge of building superintelligence.

If executives at OpenAI believed they were only a few years away from superintelligence, they'd be focusing almost all their time and ca...</div>

They're focused on making a software that automates basic white collar tasks that don't require much intelligence at all. Which will be nice, that's a lot of menial jobs that get automated. But likely not nice enough to warrant the fantasized social reform this sub dreams of. Or it will happen so gradually over the next decade, that each year there will be a new excuse/propaganda machine to convince the masses that social reform isn't necessary and that there's someone else to blame.</div>

I do think one of the misleading aspects of “AGI” is that many conflate AGI (being better than humans at pretty much everything) with some sort of omniscience.  

I personally doubt AGI is all that far off, but I am also not sure that AGI is the immediate liftoff point that some think it is, either, because it’s surely not going to be anything close to omniscience.  

We have to remember that humans are smart compared to other life forms on earth, but it’s not clear that we’re *that* smart yet in the grand scheme of all that there is to know.  i.e. AGI looks like a high bar to humans but it’s a mere stepping stone as AI/technology continues to exponentially improve in the coming years and decades.</div>

In fact, the reverse may be true. Had they never deployed any models, never done any marketing, never made any products and instead focused only on R&amp;D, I think their R&amp;D would be further behind than it is now.</div>

Revenues matter because they allow you to raise more money than what you are spending on things other than developing ASI.

Openai has way more money to develop ASI now that they have 10 billion in annualised revenue because they now have the potential to fundraise way more than if they had no revenue.</div>
