                <div class="post-content">Two weeks ago, I shared how I built my iOS game *Word Guess Puzzle* in just 48 hours using pure vibecoding — powered by AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor IDE.

It’s a fun and challenging word association puzzle game where each level makes you go “ahhh, that’s clever!” 😄

I’d genuinely love your thoughts, feedback, or any ideas you have to improve it. Every bit of encouragement helps solo indie devs like me keep going!

                <div class="post-content">One of our core experiences is that we are running continuously, always. LLMs only execute their "thinking" directly after a query and then stop once it's no longer generating an answer.

The system I'm thinking of would be an LLM that runs constantly, always thinking,  and specific thoughts triggered by that LLM trigger another LLM that is either reading that thought process or being signaled by certain thoughts to take actions.

The episodic nature of LLMs right now where they don't truly have...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Each new and unrelated query requires a fresh context window or the previous results will influence the outcome of new results.  If you could maintain a continuous related context, this would be an interesting experiment.  We are in the very beginnings of seeing the impacts of agentic systems, where different systems (LLMs or instances of LLMs) will be focused on specific tasks and taking specific actions.  I think this is similar to what you meant in the second paragraph, but I am not completely sure.

You have hit on one of the fundamental limitations of an LLM in terms of continuous action traces and memory, and it is why alternative architectures will be needed to be added to LLMs to get us to AGI.  An LLM is not designed to maintain state for an extended period or to allow new data to influence other unrelated outcomes.  Continuous training of LLM network weights leads to collapses in performance over time, which is why fine tuning is a limited scope activity.

LLMs by themselves are not enough even though they are responsible for the incredible current boom in both tech and productivity related to AI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">In addition to their limitations around long-term memory and continuous updating, transformers also suffer from an energy drag. Current silicon-based computer chips require continuous voltage at high cycling frequencies, which means "thinking"—that is, test-time inference—consumes a lot of energy, all the time. Even so-called "sparse" models like Mixture of Experts (MoE) still activate parts of every layer, and as content window size increases, memory demands grow quadratically. So letting an LLM (especially a large one) think can become prohibitively expensive.

By contrast, biological brains use spiking neural architectures: only specific neurons fire, and only when needed. Our networks are incredibly sparse—the vast majority of neurons are silent at any given moment—and when they do fire, their connections are far richer than binary. Brains are extraordinarily cheap to run. A morning of **deep** thinking costs about two cookies.</div>

Even if you wanted to let one LLM thinking continuously, its ability to generate insight would be limited by its context window: the amount of tokens it takes into account at once.

The issue is computing capacity. 

You’re not wrong in thinking that time running improves output. It does. Reasoning models work more or less like that.</div>

Lately I've been using Claude Code extensively with my Claude Max subscription, and while it is an amazing tool, it has certain bad habits that cost me time, money, and mental peace.

I've worked on about half a dozen separate codebases with Claude Code and I kept seeing the same problems pop up repeatedly, so I set up my \`CLAUDE.md\` file to handle those, but then that file got splintered across all my projects and diverged, so I set up this central repo for myself and thought it'd ...</div>

It's a one two punch approach. Half is yelling at it in all caps to generate complete code with no omissions. The other half is making sure every prompt is only asking for maximum 200 lines of code.


The stubs happen if I don't yell at it or I ask it to write three functions in one go and it gets overwhelmed.</div>

                <div class="post-content">When I first started meditating, I thought I was doing it wrong because I didn’t feel instant peace or clarity. I kept waiting for some big breakthrough.

What actually happened was more subtle.

Now, I still get stressed. I still get distracted. I still overthink things.  
But there’s a bit more **space** between the thought and the reaction.  
A little more awareness. A little more grace.</div>

In first paragraph: "*I don't lie on my quotes, and after they run the reports on all drivers/vehicles,* ***my price is always exactly the same as the quote price"***

In second paragraph: "*I've moved states so I've only done this 3 times so far, but* ***each time I've gotten a cheaper price****."*

The first paragraph seems to indicate this tip never works, but the second paragraph says that this tip has worked three times.</div>

Seems like places get you a good rate for a year and then jack up your prices hoping you won't pay attention and just sign the paperwork the following year.</div>

I don't get a cheap plan. I get the good stuff on insurance (UM 250/500/100, et cetera). I don't do roadside assistance or that, but I do comprehensive and collision $500 deductible. Not the lowest deductibles I can get, but reasonably low. Didn't find the cost added per month worth the lower deductible beyond $500.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Lex is one of the most bizarre characters in the Roganverse and general podcast world. He's one of the least charismatic people around and yet his podcast took off almost overnight and he's suddenly interviewing industry titans and world leaders. And despite his lack of charisma, he does have genuinely interesting podcast episodes.


If he'd stayed just interviewing people in industry, it would be an be an unusual case of a podcast becoming famous despite the host, but maybe less questioned. His foray into politics has given him a severe case of main character syndrome where he seems to believe he's on a mission to save the world. And brought along all the controversy that comes with getting political.

Then there's his carefully curated image. I don't think I've ever seen an episode where he doesn't mention the value of free speech, yet even the mildest disagreement gets people blocked on social media. He's always been rumoured to moderate his own reddit sub, which has been gradually whittled down to just episode discussion with critical comments removed. 
He projects his image of peace and love but is quite obviously a social climber, with some of the tidbits that do come out painting him as an altogether different and more petty person</div>

Most email providers like Gmail have a way to log out of your account on all devices.

If you change your password AND log out on all devices it’ll log the intruders out of your account.

If it still happens after that change your security questions and verify your phone numbers listed in your account don’t include intruder-added phone numbers.</div>

That is incorrect information. I have passwordless login and it still prompts to tap a number via push message. Often times it comes from the US but sometimes even places like Germany.</div>

During ownership of both, i noticed some people that drive regular cars would admire these cars and think they're cool.

Though that is true and they are cool, at the end of the day, it was just a car to me.

So those with cool cars (sports cars, super cars, etc.), is it "just a car" to you or is it something more?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I saved up many years to buy a C6 Z06 in a specific, hard-to-find color. While I do pamper the fuck out of it, I drive it at least once a week, and most of that driving is spirited.

It’s like marrying a hot person way out of your league. Drool over them, but remember to look past the beauty and actually enjoy their company, because for most of us, such luck is hard to come by. Can be applied to expensive cars, in my opinion.</div>

Wake me up when agentic teachers can interface with a classroom, control a room of children, store context of past classes, plan future classes, adjust a lesson plan for timing, and a host of other teacher-related skills.</div>

I've seen ChatGPT-driven grading algorithms get implemented for short-answer type questions that otherwise go completely ungraded 95% of the time, because each teacher has like 5 fucking classes, and the homework has 10 short answer questions, and each class has 30 kids, so you're talking about thousands and thousands of short answer questions per week, or maybe even per day depending on the frequency of the homework in the curriculum.

"But it might hallucinate" -- yeah, and so might the fucking overworked 35 year old woman who has 2 hours to try to grade 1,500 answers on a Thursday night after putting her own kids to bed and drinking another cup of coffee to try to keep her sleep deprived ass awake.</div>

Not for technical reasons, but because at a bare minimum even if the AI does all the 'educational' work, parents will almost certainly want a human babysitter in the room to care for the kids in the event of an issue or disruption etc.</div>

They are prison warden / social workers who are superior to AI in only the sense that they are attached to a meat robot.

You are not allowed to call that "teaching" because it sounds nice.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">How can a website called futurism be so against new technology? Some things that obviously seem off to:

\- They are using Mixtral (which is not even close to SOTA at this point).

\- There are tools created by Khan Academy that actually help teachers by using AI to provide students feedback on their essay and tracks whether students are copy/pasting from other apps (doesn't guarantee there won't be cheating but at least a start).

I would recommend people interested in AI in Education check out Ethan Mollick's work.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;One professor in Ithaca, NY, [shares both](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/06/tech/teachers-grading-ai/index.html) ChatGPT's comments on student essays as well as her own, and asks her students to run their essays through AI on their own.

I've done this in peer reviews on scientific papers. Not the whole paper, but just enough parts to show people how useful it is. Most people would be shocked how much garbage gets submitted to journals by grad students who have been poorly mentored, and normalizing correct AI use could solve that problem.

The most recent paper I reviewed somehow had failed to report in their results the main quantity they were measuring, statistical test results were described in inconsistent ways but always without the standard details, and they did no checking of assumptions of statistical tests (while using them in ways that probably grossly violated the assumptions). A student's advisor ought to catch "science 101" things like this before submitting a paper, but they frequently fail. People should get in the habit of using AI as a reviewer, so they can learn to avoid remedial mistakes before they waste the time of colleagues in peer review.

If this works for peer review, I see no reason why it shouldn't be used as a similar instructive tool for all forms of writing. People can greatly improve their own work just by having AI explain their mistakes. They key is to teach them how to use it for feedback rather than doing their work for them.</div>

Even if we get ASI tomorrow, and it’s curing disease or making scientific breakthroughs, people will still be hitting each other over the head over if we even have AGI or not for at least several years after it’s here.

I don’t think the concession from society that we have AGI will happen overnight, it’ll be a gradual process after it gets here.

If I had to guess, it’ll be a 2-5 year ‘capitulation phase’ post AGI/ASI. Might be on the shorter end if it’s a hard takeoff and it can crack Eric Drexler’s Nanotechnology. It’s gonna be hard for them to claim it’s not general intelligence when it’s literally reshaping the atomic and molecular composition of matter.</div>

It will Interact with everyone and help them reach a new height of their potential even overnight. Sometimes you read a quote or hear something someone said, and suddenly this makes a *click* in your brain and everything is unraveled right before your eyes.

&gt; Sakana AI is proud to release the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM), an AI model that uniquely uses the synchronization of neuron activity as its core reasoning mechanism, inspired by biological neural networks. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks, the CTM uses timing information at the neuron level that allows for more complex neural behavior and decision-making processes. This innovation enables the model to “think” through problems step-by-step, making its reasoning process interpretable and human-like. Our research demonstrates improvements in both problem-solving capabilities and efficiency across various tasks. The CTM represents a meaningful step toward bridging the gap between artificial and biological neural networks, potentially unlocking new frontiers in AI capabilities.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If I'm reading this correctly, every tick costs as much as a current feed-forward run.

So with 100 ticks, you have a model that costs 100 times as much as current transformers and requires ginormous memory.

While the ideas are awesome, their practicability is rather questionable for the time being. But if those issues get a nice, elegant solution, then fasten your seatbelts for the accelerationists and get your goalposts for the luddites. You're going to need them.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">So you know how everything really took off in the public eye around the early 2020s? That's cause in 2018 Google released "Attention is all you need" the paper that introduced transformers. This formula is what enabled chatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Llama and Deepseek to do what they're able to do. 


Since then, scaling has been the paradigm to make these things faster. Giving them more parameters makes them smarter. That said, it's looking like we're hitting diminishing returns on how much that is useful. 


So, we've been waiting for another breakthrough. Something that will impact AI the way Transformers did. This could be it.</div>
