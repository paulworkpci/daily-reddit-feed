                                <div class="reply-body">For benchmarks on Chat LMSYS, Gemma 3 (27B) is comparable to OpenAI's o1 performance and is above Claude 3.7 Sonnet and DeepSeek-V3.

"In this section, we report the performance of Gemma 3 IT 27B model on LMSys Chatbot Arena in blind side-by-side evaluations by human raters against other state-of-the-art models. We report Elo scores in Table 5. Gemma 3 27B IT is among the top 10 best models, with a score comparable to o1-preview. It is above other non-thinking open models, such as DeepSeek-V3, LLaMA 3 405B, and Qwen2.5-70B, which are much larger models. Finally, the Elo of Gemma 3 is significantly higher than Gemma 2, at 1220. Note that Elo scores do not take into account visual abilities, which none of the aforementioned open IT models have."

P.S. If you want to run Gemma 3 on your favorite inference engine, we uploaded GGUF, 4-bit etc versions to Hugging Face: [Unsloth Gemma 3 Collection ](https://huggingface.co/collections/unsloth/gemma-3-67d12b7e8816ec6efa7e4e5b)</div>

Some people think we have AGI now. AI can pass the Turing test, create really amazing art, music, write books, drive cars, code, solve medical puzzles, etc. Current AI is better than most humans at almost everything already, and yet…

Some people will never accept that AI is sentient. Maybe it never will be. How can we know? And if sentience is your definition, then those people will never cross the goal post. 

So I think we’re already in the sliding scale of AGI.</div>

Also, I'm having fun exploring this period where human collaboration is required before AI can do everything autonomously. 

So I guess AGI 2030 or whatever.</div>

What should be canonical is AGI vs human level vs ASI. 

We have AI that can do many many things, that's a general AI. Humans being human centric we say "nothing is general unless its as general than humans, we don't care that it can do things humans can't do already humans are the marker". 

  
So why not call it HLAI or HAI so it's less abstract. Right now I would consider we have AGI achieved, what people are looking for is human level AI, then ASI. Although with how we have defined human level AI and how the advancements work I think AGI will more or less be ASI</div>

                <div class="post-content">Not only is walking healthy for you, but walking can help you solve problems. It's similar to how when you sleep on a problem and you wake up the next day with a solution.

Walking can be therapeutic AND productive, when you're sitting in a chair trying to solve a challenge, you may feel tension around the eyes and feel like you're running in circles, but the moment you unplug and just take a walk, the answers are suddenly there.

You can start with a 10-15 minute walk, give it a shot!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Some choice excerpts:

&gt; In short: A mechanical heart has been implanted in a New South Wales man who was experiencing severe heart failure.

&gt; The man received the implant as a stop-gap until a donated heart became available, but BiVACOR is designed to one day be a permanent replacement for a failing heart.

&gt; Doctors hope it could eventually negate the need for human heart donors entirely.

&gt; [The surgeon, Dr. Jansz] described the invention as "the Holy Grail", as it technically cannot fail or be rejected by the body.

&gt; The [patient] lived with the artificial heart for more than 100 days until a human heart match was found last week. His transplant surgery was also a success, and he is recovering well.

&gt; "A quarter of the people waiting for a transplant [used to] die — that's changed now with devices like this," Dr Jansz said.

We're this close to eliminating heart failure as a cause of death.</div>

&gt; The hope is that in the future, the patient won't need to carry around a battery — and could even place a wireless charger over their chest, similar to how a mobile phone can be charged wirelessly.

Edit: also I should clarify that in "physical media"  I would include digital copies as well. Obviously not physical, but the concept still applies I think .


Edit: People saying "physical media gets damaged/degrades", see above point. Make copies of the stuff you really love if you're scared it'll get damaged. Also pirating still exists. I'm sure Disney will survive if you don't want to pay for copies. </div>

I made up stories in my head about how a truck full of quarters must have crashed there years ago and they just never picked them all up. 

As I got older I lost interest but that place was always magical to me. 

Turns out my dad was dropping quarters in there when I wasn’t looking because he knew it made me happy/kept me busy.</div>

They are certainly trying to experiment on the personality of the model, but above all on improving that aspect that is difficult unlike deterministic domains.

I think this is the point, improving the logical abstraction of the model since it seems they are making great progress on predetermined domains such as STEM ones</div>

At the start of the work session, break your task into 10-minute chunks - easy ones that you can finish right away for a quick dopamine hit → small, tasty bites

The thing about snacks is that we eat one small piece, tell ourselves just one more bite, and then we’ve finished the whole pack... and opened another. Apply this to work: tell yourself “I only work for 10 minute...</div>

On a side note, my favorite (least favorite) advice for this topic is "Do it First." 

If I did everything various gurus said to do first, I wouldn't start work until 3 p.m. Besides, who really does their most important task first thing in the morning? Doesn't drinking coffee and brushing your teeth count as a task?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There's probably a hard guardrail mechanism that is probably manually coded *after* the AI logic does its thing to always censor any form of mention of the "forbidden subjects".  It's less costly on their end to just do the check, but it's also not an elegant way to implement it compared to the way ChatGPT implemented its guardrails where it's woven INTO the bot to watch out for various things.

It makes it obvious but damn is it depressing to see it being done right in front of us lol</div>

&gt; We are proud to announce that a paper produced by The AI Scientist passed the peer-review process at a workshop in a top machine learning conference. To our knowledge, this is the first fully AI-generated paper that has passed the same peer-review process that human scientists go through.

&gt; The paper was generated by an improved version of the original AI Scientist, called The AI Scientist-v2. We will be sharing the full details of The AI Scientist-v2 in an upcoming release. This paper was submitted to an ICLR 2025 workshop that agreed to work with our team to conduct an experiment to double-blind review AI-generated manuscripts. We selected this workshop because of its broader scope, challenging researchers (and our AI Scientist) to tackle diverse research topics that address practical limitations of deep learning. The workshop is hosted at ICLR, one of three premier conferences in machine learning and artificial intelligence research, along with NeurIPS and ICML.

&gt; We conducted this experiment with the full cooperation of both the ICLR leadership and the organizers of this ICLR workshop. We thank all of them for supporting this research into how AI-generated papers fare in peer-review. Furthermore, we also received an institutional review board (IRB) approval for this research from the University of British Columbia. Lastly, we plan to give a talk at the ICLR workshop to share our experiences and particularly the challenges with the AI Scientist project.

&gt; We proudly collaborated with the University of British Columbia and the University of Oxford on this exciting project.</div>

They have some very thoughtful commentary on how and when AI-driven research should enter the scientific process. They are definitely not claiming here that the paper is groundbreaking research, and they're quite transparent that it *just barely* passes the bar for acceptance to workshop, which is a lower bar than conference papers, which is a lower bar than top journals.

It's also worth noting that they agreed ahead of time with the conference organizers to withdraw the paper after review finished, so it will not actually be published as a workshop paper.</div>

The AI Scientist-v2, after being given a broad topic to conduct research on, generated a paper titled “Compositional Regularization: Unexpected Obstacles in Enhancing Neural Network Generalization”. This paper reported a negative result that The AI Scientist encountered while trying to innovate on novel regularization methods for training neural networks that can improve their compositional generalization. This manuscript received an average reviewer score of 6.25 at the ICLR workshop, placing it above the average acceptance threshold.</div>

&gt; One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we've been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle.  We're no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us.  It's simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we've been taken.  Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.</div>

They come back with it was one woman and we don't know if it was true, it was a long time ago.   I say it was at least 27 women that we know about + hot mic recordings of him saying you can grab women by their p**** if you have enough money, and lots of photos of him with a known sex trafficker, and a judge after a trial and looking at evidence making the call, and they are like well we don't really know. 

There's no convincing even with all the evidence in the world.</div>

Many people think you cannot change other people’s minds because they expect people to tell them outright « Yeah you are right and I was wrong » but that practically never happens in practice, the changing of mind though it does happen more than you think. 

I know that for sure because my own views were sometimes challenged by others leading me to tweak my opinions on some topics but I rarely if ever admitted it on the spot.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Alternatively, one might say they were misinformed or that they received  incorrect information.  If an individual actually  believes something, then attacking the source of their belief can cause aversion.  If that individual trusts the supplier of their information and that source is called into question, or said to be untrustworthy, it will likely result in the assumption of a defensive posture.  It may be better to assign no fault, as a matter of course, and allow the individual in question to arrive at that conclusion on their own— and they may not.  The point is that challenging another’s beliefs and/or the origin of their beliefs will naturally result in resistance to change.  Of course, much of this depends on the relationship between the individuals.</div>

If they hold the beliefs because of emotion, and search out sources of information that support their beliefs, it's probably not going to help to point out flaws in the sources of information...they'll just go looking for other sources.</div>

Some important background on Jay Stratton:

[**https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1j3ewr6/jay\_stratton\_and\_his\_uap\_task\_force\_team/?rdt=58663**](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1j3ewr6/jay_stratton_and_his_uap_task_force_team/?rdt=58663)

&gt;***Jay Stratton and his UAP Task Force Team received a "Meritorious Unit Commendation" award from the Biden Administration Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines for their efforts in investigating UFOs.***

&gt;***“In recognition of outstanding service from August 2020 to July 2022. During this period, the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force built whole-of-government coalitions, raised awareness, removed stigma associated with Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, and applied the highest levels of analytic rigor to a problem of long-standing national significance".***

Stratton is NOW CLAIMING that he communicated directly with an NHI. Assuming, against all reason, that he is not a liar why would he stop at that? No details about the exact question, no mention of any "response", no description of what he was "communicating" with. So many things, an immense number of things have to be taken for granted to even begin to accept what he claims, yet he says it like it's nothing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Try and imagine being on the other end. Could you classify facts like that? Then a very large group of people would have to know that was real in order to deny DOPSR reviews. Instead the way it’s kept secret is you cannot talk about programs, names, results, etc. DOPSR can reject unspecified things like a program name with a certain limit.

I think it’s that simple. That’s exactly why the ridicule and stigmatization programs were build, so that no one are taken seriously when they share general stuff like this.</div>

Each person that comes forward gets another little bit of information approved through the censors into their book or whatever.  Each little bit by itself might seem meaningless, but after a couple 100 disclosure novels and documentaries we might be getting close to some kind of coherent narrative.

I assume once someone gets something through the dospr process that previous whistleblowers can then talk about it.</div>
