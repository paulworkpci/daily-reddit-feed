Saying the answer had "directly conflicting evidence in peer reviewed literature" isn't all that meaningful in a vacuum. I can genuinely find peer reviewed literature that claims there is an association between vaccines and autism. All that means is some pay-to-publish journal was willing to accept the paper and the peer review was crap.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I played a role in curating some problems for the Humanity’s Last Exam benchmark (particularly in mathematics/computer science) so I have some insights.

From my experience, the review process for creating these problems seemed rather hasty. Typically, we had some academic person A coming up with a problem to be tested against some SoTA LLMs, and it would then be sent for review if and only if it stumped at least some models. 

After the problem passed this initial assessment, it would then be added to a spreadsheet where other academics could review the work. Each problem could only be assigned to at most one other academic. 

If this reviewer deemed the problem to be good, it would be sent to QC for final review… but this person likely did NOT have the required subject expertise to answer the question without external help.

Therefore, there were really only two academics reviewing any singular question, hence the issue…</div>

Life gets busy straight after graduating college, we talk about being in contact but well that does no really happen. People are changing careers, relationships, families, and somehow the idea of just “meeting new people” starts to feel like another task on an already overflowing to-do list. Most of the time our schedules clash, and dating apps while they promise connection but you cannot expect "friendships" out of it.

In my shoot life I try to go to local small concerts, at least once a week. I'm taking just band playing with no cover at a bar, public event in the park, that kind of thing. I look for people about my age, compliment something the did intentionally like their haircut or shirt or shoes, and if we don't hit it off in a few exchanges I move on. If they're there again next week, cool, I'll say hi to them again. Some of them become buddies that you plan to see at the next one, or make plans to check out a new venue together. Or go to a baseball game together because you're buddies now.</div>

The thing works as a proof of concept it's just painfully slow. In the time it would take to copy and paste my password, and the 2 factor, I could have been done faster just doing it myself.

However, it's easier now to see this functioning natively on a logged in browser. Once that happens this really will speed things up, a lot. And sites won't be able to blanket ban because the hits are coming from the user's own browser.

I assume we'll see native browser integration in less than a year from someone. If no one else will do it I'm virtually certain Elon will.</div>

UCLA researchers use prompting and self-correction to get gold medal in 2025 IMO with Gemini 2.5 Pro (which was released months before the competition took place) You can read their methodology yourself to verify it does not give the model any hints on what the answer is: https://www.alphaxiv.org/abs/2507.15855?s=09

For reference, Gemini 2.5 Pro only gets 13/42 points without any additional prompting. A bronze medal is 19 points and a gold is 35 points. https://matharena.ai/</div>

Update #2 - it got an even more difficult question right and did it very briefly with a perfect counter-example. [https://chatgpt.com/s/t\_68842c7357e88191898d79d28af40819](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68842c7357e88191898d79d28af40819)

For whatever reason the prompt doesn't show on ChatGPT, so to clarify it was "The \\textit{repeat} of a positive integer is obtained by writing it twice in a row. For example, the repeat of $254$ is $254254$. Is there a positive integer whose repeat is a square number?"</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think the quote points to the idea that meditation helps us loosen the grip on the “story of who we are.” A rigid personality often comes from layers of conditioning, roles, and defenses we’ve built over time, which can block deeper presence. Through meditation, it’s not so much about erasing our personality but creating space between our true self and those layers. The less we cling to those rigid identities, the more room there is for presence, awareness, and connection to flow naturally.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">What trips me up is how do we incorporate more of our “presence” into specific social situations? My confusion arises because of social roles that we all play, and the various social filters (or even masks) that we wear for social purposes. The way I see it is that we aren’t being really “present” or “real” whenever we are playing specific social roles or filtering ourselves socially for conventional or polite purposes — in those instances, we are acting and role playing and behaving according to expected or necessary social scripts, and again, that feels very at odds with being present and real. 

However, I recognize the need for playing roles and filtering ourselves.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is a good question. I interpret this as the ability to flow, grow, and change forms. If we’re very rigid, we can stuck in our ways, beliefs and thought patterns. When we aren’t so rigid, we are powerful in the sense that we are adaptable, able to connect more deeply and have the potential for greater growth.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly. Adaptability really is power. It’s like water; the less rigid we are, the more we can flow around obstacles instead of crashing into them. Meditation seems to help with that by loosening the grip on fixed beliefs so we can grow without losing our sense of self.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think this speaks to identification with personality aspects. If I'm tied to an idea that I'm a certain way, I'll be that way and never grow beyond that.

Identification with anything, imo, is a source of suffering. For me, identifying with an outcome has caused a lot of suffering. Being aware of this allows me to let the desire to identify with something pass. 

Being in the flow for me means that my quiet, still, inner observer is simply observing what is, accepting of what is, feeling like, "Isn't that interesting." Regardless of what "it" is.</div>

I stole a trick from someone here that works ok. Before each task ask it to give two (or three) possible approaches with one of them being radically simpler. 

You still gotta kinda know what you’re doing though. Even if you start on the right path it can accumulate junk code if you’re not watching diffs.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Smog ≠ CO2. This ruling is basically pointing out that the EPA's scope is for pollutants directly harmful to human health. That means NOx, SOx, ozone, etc. Stuff that gives you cancer. CO2 does not qualify as directly hazardous to human health in that manner, heck, we exhale it every day! Twisting the text of the Clean Air Act to cover GHG emissions is a bit silly. If you want to regulate greenhouse gases, the proper way is that Congress should pass a law doing so instead of twisting a 50 year old law.


Edi: Comments got locked so I'm posting my response to the guy who replied to me by linking a Nature article about the dangers of CO2.


You realize that article proves my point, right? 1,000 ppm, a concentration only really reached *indoors* (as stated in that article) is not in the same ballpark of the dangerous concentrations of the other pollutants the EPA regulates. Stuff like SO2, Ozone, NOx, etc are in like the 2 ppm range, even less. Ozone is like 0.5 ppm. Volatile organic compounds are dangerous at 0.1 ppm. Other sulfur derivatives are in the parts per BILLION. It's an order of magnitude of difference.


You cannot put CO2 and these compounds in the same sentence when discussing direct, immediate threats to respiratory health and smog. The EPA was created to regulate direct, immediate threats to respiratory health and smog. Do a little more research, the implication you're trying to push makes no sense if you actually know the chemistry.</div>

Somewhere around 1985-1990 got on the last chopper in terms of having enough invested to retire and weather this upcoming societal upheaval.

I could've retired at 40 if the moneytrain kept going for another decade but now I'm utterly fucked and destined to be part of the permanent underclass. SWE was the only job I was decent at and can do.

I am 80% certain that I will no longer be employable as a software engineer in any capacity by January 1, 2028. 50% by January 1, 2027.

AI is so exciting but terrifying at the same time. We can only pray that AI causes insane deflation and everything becomes largely abundant, because it's pretty much over if not.</div>

So will basically everyone else, if you must put a label on it. The idea money made prior to an intelligence Cambrian explosion, will have great value, is kind of insane.


Should it come to pass, space mining and other drivers of wealth creation, currency of today will be rendered effectively worthless. For a transition period, sure accumulated wealth should help, but that's not permanent.


Put another way, if a remote ancient tribe was discovered, and they went ahead to integrate fully into modern civilization - just how valuable do you think their former stores of wealth would be? </div>

mass adoption in &lt;2 years is ridiculous, use your little logical brain.  im a senior swe born in 9# and as far as I'm concerned I'm going to be the last one out the door, and at that point everyone is unemployed. from a business perspective, it makes a lot more sense to get your existing workforce (or a downsized version) to use ai to multiple output by 10x 100x whatever.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You should be nervous and excited! But every time one of these posts pops up, we need to talk about UBI (Universal Basic Income). If machines are going to displace the jobs of humans, then humans need to be taken care of in the meantime.

If we don't implement something like UBI, AI companies will just run off with the profits into the sunset, and the wealth inequality gap will keep widening.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">UBI is virtually guaranteed. It won't be called UBI - it'll be called "extended unemployment benefits."

But it'll be too little to live well on. We need to talk about Universal High Income :)

That could honestly be an easier sell. You hear UBI, you might think that's other people mooching off your taxes. But you hear UHI, well that's you getting rich (with everyone else).</div>

On location shooting is going to shrink, and the traditional filmmaking method will likely become relagated to a boutique type service. There will always be high demand for handmade, human stories, but only top companies and big budget productions will be able to justify the cost. Similar to shooting on film instead of digital. 

It may happen slowly, or it may happen all at once, but everyone knows it's coming. In the narrative world I think it will happen slower.  In the commercial world, it'll happen all at once</div>
