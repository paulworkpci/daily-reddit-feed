For the longest time, I misunderstood the idea of detachment. I thought it meant cutting off from people, from outcomes, from caring too much. But this quote hit me differently. It made me reflect on one experience that changed the way I approach life.

A few months ago, I was working on my first youtube video - a small script I’d written,  and edited by myself. I poured my soul into it....</div>

I think there is an aspect of ego/identity involved too.

THAT’S when you learn about detachment lolol.

Happy this didn’t happen to you! Yes - we can still use social media and create content online. But do it for the act of whatever it is you want to create, and hope that it helps just a few people and don’t try to appeal to the most amount of people as possible (clout chasing)</div>

15 years ago they launched it. Ahead of the curve. Mostly novelty. But functional. 

Somehow 15 years later its less competent, less useful, less everything. And this is during the rise of AI. 

Its truly an impressive blunder.</div>

Just tell them you're paying cash at the last second and there's nothing they can do. The dealer isn't forced to sell you a car. If they've gone through the negotiations discounting the car because they think there's money to be made on the back end/financing, then when the customers tries to pull the "oh I'm a cash buyer" at the last second, the dealer can say "No thanks, that's not a cash price".</div>

The robots will function as their caretakers, perform augments, surgeries, cook, clean, farm, build tools, etc. so "work" becomes meaningless. no one will need anything from anyone else, so the concept of economy will cease to exist.



Only like 10 people on the planet will have the robots and everyone else will be fired! 


Or none of that happens and the neck beard in the video moves the goalposts in a few years.

I edit files directly.  
* **context7-mcp**: keeps the last seven messages. Call `get()` for recent context.  
* **server-sequential-thinking**: queues server tasks in order.  
* **toolbox**: common helper functions. Import what you need.  
* **supabase**: connect to Supabase via env vars and CRUD helpers.  
* **shopify-dev-mcp**: mock Shopify API calls in dev mode.  
* **desktop-commander**: sends scripted clicks and keystrokes.  
* **mem0-memory-mcp**: stores short-lived data in RAM for fast cache.  
* **think-mcp-server**: lightweight reasoning engine. Post data, get analysis.  
* **magic-21st-dev**: experimental generator for special effects. Enable flag, send prompt.

# CLAUDE.md

This file guides Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in this repo.

## Available MCP Tools

- **context7-mcp**  
  Keeps the last seven messages handy. Import it and call `get()` whenever you need recent context.

- **server-sequential-thinking**  
  Runs server tasks in order. Queue jobs here so nothing overlaps.

- **toolbox**  
  Common helper functions. Import the ones you need instead of rewriting code.

- **desktop-commander**  
  Sends scripted desktop commands. Start it, then pass plain-text commands.

- **mem0-memory-mcp**  
  Stores short-lived data in RAM. Use it for fast cache and read before it expires.

- **think-mcp-server**  
  A lightweight reasoning engine. Post data to its endpoint and read back the analysis.

- **supabase**  
  Connect straight to your Supabase backend. Set your keys in env vars and use CRUD helpers.

- **shopify-dev-mcp**  
  Test Shopify calls safely in dev mode. Hit its mock APIs.

- **magic-21st-dev**  
  Experimental generator for special effects. Enable the flag, send a prompt, review output.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not create new tools without telling the user.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">ChatGPT is nowhere near competent enough at mental health care to be in this role. It will regularly:

- validate paranoid thoughts or fears 

- offer reassurance to obsessive-compulsive sufferers who are compulsively reassurance seeking 

- validate avoidance behaviors in generalized anxiety disorder

- participate in delusions 

It’s very dangerous. Real therapy is often about pushing back against cognitive distortions and getting clients to do things they’re uncomfortable with. ChatGPT is trained not to discomfort the end user.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">In January, speaking about the Trump Coin, the primary co-founder of Ethereum (the second largest crypto asset by market cap), Vitalik Buterin stated
"Now is the time to talk about the fact that large-scale political coins cross a further line: they are not just sources of fun, whose harm is at most contained to mistakes made by voluntary participants, they are vehicles for unlimited political bribery, including from foreign nation states." Vitalik is pretty much a savant,  but it doesn't take a savant to see how easily Trump coin can be used to funnel anonymous payments to Trump. Easily the biggest conflict of interest in political and Presidential history. Trump coin made him billions (with a "B") - makes Nancy's $100 million over decades seem like nothing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is what is annoying about Rogan and his moronic followers.  They just use Pelosi as  if she is the only one who did it.  Yet every single one on the other side of the aisles does it too.  They did it really bad through covid literally profiting off the death of citizens.  
  
Also, Pelosi originally  argued it is not corruption because we are a free market society and then rather quickly changed her tune and began working towards legislation to end the loophole.

Her leadership team introduced a bill in September 2022 that would have required lawmakers, their spouses, and dependents to **divest or put assets in a blind trust**.

So why choose the person who worked towards legislation to end it and put focus on the other side of the asisle where it has always been done and they fight to be able to keep doing?

Rogan loves to dazzle the fucking idiots.</div>

We can’t upend decades, if not centuries, of modern economic/social/political/anthropological existence in 2 years and expect things to go well. Statistically speaking</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean even if he's right, which I would imagine a lot of researchers probably would have disagreements to varying degrees, a continual acceleration over the next decade that's anywhere close to what we have seen so far would be insanely transformative. And very competent researchers believe that the rate of progress will not slow down. So I don't think there's anything to worry about lol.

Also, this might be my misinterpretation of things, but it seems like we might be able to hit some self-improving flywheels on certain domains first, while others may take a bit more time.</div>

Unfortunately that’s an ability we are losing as a nation. For every Jim Farley, there are a thousand more who dismisses anything Chinese as “propaganda” (just look at this morning’s Xiaomi thread, absolutely embarrassing).

Hell, those people are here in this thread, calling everyone shills because they are suffering through a cognitive dissonance due to their confirmation bias being attacked.

That’s not mentioning the entire EV thing is now a hot political issue here, with the people fighting against EVs being the same people who get all upset at China’s EV progress.

Apparently other countries are not even allowed to beat us in a competition that we decided to not participate in.</div>

Like I grew up with Asian parents. My parents constantly told me how overachieving all the other kids are, not to “glaze” them, but to motivate *me*.

It doesn’t mean my parents wanted to disown me and adopt other kids.

Maybe the American attitude is to always praise your own and dismiss others’ achievements just to feel better.

IMO, that is not a good attitude for success.</div>

It's not constantly. Mostly in the morning it's gone but starts again during the day, it can be any moment. It's start with random pulses, no constant and more to the end of the day constant. Sometimes I don't have it the whole day, but I feel like some pressure on it. Anyways it's complex and a lot more to it to go in detail. The thing is, I've been to doctors different ones and specialist in throat noise ears. They all say something else and they just don't listen, they try to push you to something it isn't. 

I tried to ask chatgpt and the diagnostic they provided looks much closer of what my symptoms are. I'm gonna try some other specialist soon and ask them to look to the one chatgpt provided, because they aren't doing their job and it pissing me off.</div>

Also anyone with an elderly parent can attest to the balancing of various meds until they reach an equilibrium through informed trial and error.  Then a new condition changes/appears and it’s back to rebalancing.</div>

If you wanted to deploy AI in healthcare and trained it on real visits it would also have the prior that with high probability someone is actually just lying, is some sort of hyperchondriac, is a drug addict, or has some other serious mental issues.
