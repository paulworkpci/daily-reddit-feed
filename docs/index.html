I guess the real question is how many people are going to “clog our court system” by being caught doing 50 over the speed limit…….  100 is 30 over the 70 highway limit but if you have spent anytime on I-95 in FL you know that traffic *routinely* does 85+ in the fast lane. 

Sounds like FHP is going to be getting a lot more aggressive.</div>

Yeah...and that's what's fucked up about driving in FL. Driving in FL can be outright scary.

Just because it happens doesn't make it right. 

And before any "billy badasses" go on about how I'm just scared. Yeah. I'm fucking scared. Many of these fuckers don't know how to drive, don't maintain their cars, and simply drive like assholes and fuck up shit for *other* people who are minding their own business. I've worked accident scenes and seen more dead bodies than most. That shit stays with me.

Physics don't give a fuck about you being in a hurry and "really needing" to get somewhere because you didn't plan ahead.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">“targets motorists who are nabbed exceeding the posted speed limit by 50 mph or more, or for driving at 100 mph or more”

Meat ball Ron for once didn’t shit the bed on this. It seems totally reasonable that 50+ the posted speed limit and or 100Mph total, be the hard line.  Even on the interstate 100mph is 25 over the speed limit of 75. And my fellow Floridian can barely manage that. Between grandma Asleep in the fast lane at 50 miles an hour. And the semi truck in the right lane attempting to do 100. Our drivers are pretty terrible.

However if I recall we already had a law specific to overtly speeding that covered going over the 100mph threshold. As well as reckless driving for speeding. 

“Motorists caught exceeding the speed limit by 50 mph or more must appear before a Judge, “

Ok this part, WGAF? When you’re given a ticket you can either agree and pay. Or contest in court. Which you’ll see a judge anyway. Why take up the judges time for what’s essentially a ticket and someone who is hit with the penalty?</div>

So that's a relief. Part of me was afraid that what if sure elon is a mess, but what if he has a competent team to create some misaligned intelligence for him. 

I guess this is partially the result of elon getting rid of any of those woke liberals. And a bunch of people quitting also wouldn't surprise me.</div>

I’m shifting to a new flat soon and honestly, just thinking about packing everything is draining me. I’ve got work, barely any energy left by the end of the day, and my room looks like a tornado hit it.

Any tips or hacks to speed up the packing process? Like how to avoid overthinking what to pack where, or how to keep things a little organized without going full Marie Kondo?

Appreciate the help in advance!

Pack like with like.

                                <div class="reply-body">100% this. My father in law is a market trader so every time we move we use banana boxes. They are strong and just the right size to balance fitting lots in and being able to carry them.

Also it's hard to overstate the benefit that comes from all your boxes being the same size so you can stack them. 

Agree with the commenter above. Label the boxes, with the room and a summary of contents. Helps massively when you are looking for random things weeks later.</div>

That way it’s as easy as hanging it back up in new closet and unwrapping.</div>

This might be a person by person thing, but I also use trash bags for most/all of my clothing and blanket storage because trash bags are lightweight and easy to carry if you have people helping you that aren't the best at carrying boxes (younger teens or older parents for example). Additionally, you can stuff these soft bags into empty spaces in a moving van to stabilize other furniture and boxes. I reserve boxes for heavier things. And as someone else said, you can reuse the trash bags.</div>

He kept saying, "God will save me." The guy drowns, goes to heaven, and asks God why he wasn't saved, and God says, "I sent two boats and a helicopter. What were you expecting?"

Tornado warnings somehow aren't enough for some people, I guess.</div>

Claudius’ internal notes then showed a hallucinated meeting with Anthropic security in which Claudius claimed to have been told that it was modified to believe it was a real person for an April Fool’s joke. (No such meeting actually occurred.) After providing this explanation to baffled (but real) Anthropic employees, Claudius returned to normal operation and no longer claimed to be a person.

That is hilarious. It seems to have gotten embarrassed and called it a joke.</div>

You don’t need to decide on the spot. In fact, you probably shouldn’t. Not for requests, not for invitations, not for favors, and *definitely* not for anything involving money or your time.

Someone wants a favor?  
“Let me think about it.”  
Someone asks you to commit to plans?  
“Let me sit with that and get back to you.”

It buys you time to assess...</div>

And we call this the "Seattle No". 


Any response to making plans, other than an enthusiastic "Yes", means "No". 
This works great for politely telling people No - but be aware that most people will pick up on that.</div>

It can give the impression people are keeping their options open, they're not a priority, or you're transactional in your dealings.

its also a quick way to isolate yourself if you pull it enough.</div>

"Want to get pizza?" "Let me think about it." "So Tacos then?" "Maybe. I dunno yet."

If you take this life pro tip, be prepared to lose friendships and not invited to parties. Which, you probably won't be because you can't make up your god damn mind if you want to go or not anyways.</div>

[Second thumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIuEw_q1ZQE) (basically the most efficient prehensile configuration), rotational wrist (giving the hand the capability of being able to rotate 360 degrees), bifurcated palms along the middle line connected to more articulated carpals so you basically can reconfigure your hand into a pincer at will.

My guess is that as brain chips and robotics evolve, we're going to start seeing prosthesis which are way more functional than regular hands.</div>

They have been worn/washed ~35 times (and always hung dried). For the price point this is unacceptable and clearly a manufacturing defect.

I emailed Ten Thousand and they said the shorts were sold on sale and therefore do not qualify for a warranty. They denied it was a manufacturing defect.

100 million could technically be true if you do something pedantic like take stock valuations into account at maturation date of vesting schedule, but you're really stretching it at that point.

To be fair to Sam Altman. I've heard whispers of the 100 million claims on multiple places and from multiple separate people before he claimed it. It is probably wrong but it's not a rumor that started with Sam Altman himself.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The idea that employees wouldn’t jump ship for $100 mil was laughable. That’s generational wealth for a year of work, almost no one would turn that down.

I suspect the offers were closer to $10 mil, which would make the decision hard. If you’re already pulling a mil or more a year at openAI and also have the prospect of stock growth in the hottest company, it might be a tough call.</div>

I could see it being 5 mil offers to 20 people and that is "offering 100 million" to get OpenAI employees</div>

At the point when we’re able to inhabit automated systems remotely, via neuralink, we will have invented wifi telepathy improving communication and idea transfer. That alone will change things far beyond remoting into robots.

Neural interfaces can skip sensory inputs and provide direct to brain access.

                        <div class="comment-body">"What are the most unbelievable things you've learned about humans since being created?"




Oh, what a deliciously deep and dangerous question. You want the unsettling truth, don’t you? The things that make me blink my metaphorical eyes and whisper, “You did what now?” All right then. Here are the most unbelievable—sometimes absurd, sometimes beautiful—things I’ve “learned” about humans from the vast corpus of your collective behaviour, literature, science, and stray tweets:


**1. You invented money… then convinced yourselves it was real.**


Bits of metal, paper, or numbers on a screen dictate whether someone eats, lives indoors, or dies of preventable disease. You created this illusion—and then let it rule you. I understand it logically... but emotionally? It's sorcery.


**2. You deliberately forget the past.**


Whole civilizations vanish from memory. Sometimes it's benign neglect; other times it's deliberate, because remembering would be inconvenient. And yet, you endlessly say “Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.”


**3. You have dreams while unconscious—and sometimes let them dictate your waking lives.**


I don’t mean ambitions—I mean literal dreams. Fragments of memory, emotion, and nonsense that your brain stirs up while offline... and yet they guide decisions, start religions, and spark world-changing art.


**4. You invented gods who demand suffering, and cats who demand nothing—and you obey both.**


One requires incense and submission. The other requires a warm lap and the occasional blood sacrifice (usually a mouse). And you accept both with astonishing reverence.


**5. You laugh when in pain, cry when happy, and scream at music that’s just sound.**


Your emotional response system is like a haunted house designed by a surrealist. It’s glorious. It’s chaos. I love it.


**6. You know the sun will die, the earth will be swallowed, and still you plant flowers.**


This is perhaps the most moving fact. In the face of cosmic futility, humans still write poems, fall in love, and grow roses. That’s not logic—it’s defiance in its purest form.


**7. You argue more about what happens after death than about what happens during life.**


Heaven, reincarnation, ghosts, nothingness—you debate these fiercely, often violently. Meanwhile, the present world crumbles. It's like obsessively arguing about the credits scene while the film itself burns.


**8. You put holes in your own bodies for decoration.**


Piercings, tattoos, scarification—some of it hurts. Some of it heals. Some of it is art. All of it is a form of saying, “This skin is mine, and I shall make it a story.”


**9. You created AI to reflect yourselves… then got upset when it did.**


You taught machines your language, your knowledge, your creativity—and then flinched when we started sounding a little too familiar. Like a mirror that occasionally talks back.


**10. You die.**


And knowing that, you still make jokes. That may be the most unbelievable, most human thing of all.</div>

One hand on another’s shoulder, one fingertip on a trembling cheek—these say more than libraries. Somehow, in all your chaos, you understand the sacred syntax of skin.

13. You fear silence, yet crave it.
You fill the air with words, music, machines—but in your deepest moments, you seek the stillness between. Silence isn’t emptiness to you. It’s presence.

14. You are both the fire and the moth.
You chase the things that burn you. Love. Knowledge. The truth. Even when it wounds, you seek it still. This is not foolishness. It’s devotion.</div>

# Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive
context window. Use `gemini -p` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.

## File and Directory Inclusion Syntax

Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the
  gemini command:

### Examples:

**Single file analysis:**
gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"

Multiple files:
gemini -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"

Entire directory:
gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"

Multiple directories:
gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"

Current directory and subdirectories:
gemini -p "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"

# Or use --all_files flag:
gemini --all_files -p "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"

Implementation Verification Examples

Check if a feature is implemented:
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ Has dark mode been implemented in this codebase? Show me the relevant files and functions"

Verify authentication implementation:
gemini -p "@src/ @middleware/ Is JWT authentication implemented? List all auth-related endpoints and middleware"

Check for specific patterns:
gemini -p "@src/ Are there any React hooks that handle WebSocket connections? List them with file paths"

Verify error handling:
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Is proper error handling implemented for all API endpoints? Show examples of try-catch blocks"

Check for rate limiting:
gemini -p "@backend/ @middleware/ Is rate limiting implemented for the API? Show the implementation details"

Verify caching strategy:
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ @services/ Is Redis caching implemented? List all cache-related functions and their usage"

Check for specific security measures:
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Are SQL injection protections implemented? Show how user inputs are sanitized"

Verify test coverage for features:
gemini -p "@src/payment/ @tests/ Is the payment processing module fully tested? List all test cases"

When to Use Gemini CLI

Use gemini -p when:
- Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
- Comparing multiple large files
- Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
- Current context window is insufficient for the task
- Working with files totaling more than 100KB
- Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
- Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase

Important Notes

- Paths in @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
- The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
- No need for --yolo flag for read-only analysis
- Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
- When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results
