Seems like that would be a major conflict of interest For anyone working the court, prosecution, or anything against. Especially because we’re seeing directly how news and events in the case are directly impacting the stock market. Thereby creating an active circle of corruption that is dynamic operating all around Luigi.

Submission statement 

  
This is all fresh in my mind and I'm still trying to process what happened.



During the evening of the 16th of December I noticed a strange glowing object hovering towards the back of my house. I live in the countryside in the South of England (Wickham), and behind my house there is nothing, no buildings, no street lights, it's just a large grassy area / field where I often walk my dog.



The object in question was circular or orb shaped, and was very bright to the point where my eyes couldn't focus on it. It reminded me of when you look at a star through a telescope, it's slightly clearer but you can't make out what it is due to the amount of light being emitted. 



Due to it happening at night my IPhone camera did a terrible job at picking it up. The object made no noise, and the only reason I knew it was there was because I let my dog out for her evening toilet before bed, and it was in my line of view as I opened the backdoor. The whole encounter lasted I would say around a minute, if I had let my dog out in the garden a few minutes before or after I would never have seen it.



About 20 seconds after initially spotting it I noticed that it appeared to be dripping a molten-like metal onto the ground. After doing this multiple times it started moving left in the sky, and after this it vanished from sight due to moving behind the large Oak trees on my property that are around 40 feet in height. (I'll try and highlight this in one of the images, I've also adjusted the brightness to help highlight the object as it's quite difficult to make out .)



I came upstairs and updated my husband about what I had just seen, and he suggested that the next morning we should head out into the field behind our house with his metal detector. 



It took a while but we started finding clumps of metal like materials that looked as though they had been fused and heated at an extreme temperature and then cooled. The items also appeared multilayered. 



Shortly after the sighting, there were helicopters in the area, we could hear them from our bedroom flying over our house so we knew they were close, however I will say that living in the South of England there are multiple military sites, so not sure if that's a correlation.



I've never seen anything like this before, and the whole encounter probably lasted no more than 60 seconds as the object was constantly moving the whole time.



My question is what did I see? Is it common for UFOs to drip metal, or could this have been something different? Is it worth sending these metal things off somewhere to get them tested and if so where would I send them, a university?



Thanks

If you dig deep enough I had a bunch of covid posts.

Here's one.

Everytime CDC, WHO or Fauci Gaslit the public about Covid

CDC: do not wear masks, it isn't that serious. 2019

Only n95 masks would be effective anyway and healthcare workers need them. 2019

Covid started in a wuhan fishmarket from batsoup the virus lab in Wuhan has nothing to do with it anybody who says it did is giving misinformation 2019

Please stop wearing gloves, wearing gloves all day actually spreads disease more. (But masks don't?) 2019

People can spread covid without ever getting sick or knowing they have it-2019 (this is important)

2020: no we arent overmarking covid deaths!

2020 the fastest developed vaccine in human history beating the second fastest by 9 and a half years is out! Go get it.

Even if your not worried about covid yourself you should get it to protect to others! 2020 (this is why almost everybody got it)

Yes the johnson and johnson is causing blodclots but the odds of getting that side effect arent any worse than any other vaccine! 2020( some may have missed the hidden truth in this one)

2021 no the vaccine doesnt actually cure covid, or or prevent catching it, but your symptoms will be less severe. ( but you can still spread it to others)

2021 yes we over marked covid deaths because theres no way of knowing how much or how little covid contributed to someone's death so if they were positive at all it counts as comorbidity and a covid death!

2021 covid started in a Wuhan virus lab

2021 dramatic increase in heart issues with young people, oh well.

2021 0 recorded flu deaths! It's because of masks!

2022 the defintion of the term herd immunity changed to say only when people are vaccinated instead of when a disease runs its course and natural immunity/resistance  is developed.

2022 womens menstrual cycles are changing dramatically and young people have a dramatic increase in heart issues. Weird!

2022 80% of the country is vaccinated but then death rates arent going down! Only the unvaccinated are dying though (ignore how it's possible the rates are far greater than prevaccination)

2022 we dont want to release Pfizer's data because it will make them look bad

2022 Pfizer's data states it was barely tested, isnt even a covid protein, didnt work at all, and hundreds of  people died within days or weeks after the vaccine 

 2022: okay the vaccine doesnt prevent infection or spreading, or deaths, but your far less likely to die from covid because we said so.

2022: the isolation precautions of being unvaccinated and vaccinated are now exactly the same

2022&lt;you are here

                                <div class="reply-body">The only thing that gets a pass for me is the gloves thing. Improper use of gloves is way worse than just washing your hands consistently.

People were wearing a single pair of latex gloves all day touching 1000 things and then finally after getting home throwing them away.

It's way more effective to just wash your hands or use hand sanitizer when touching germy surfaces, this goes for ALL things not COVID.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Your memory is defective. Or, more likely, you're just making most of these up. Neither the WHO nor the CDC made **any** public announcements about COVID in 2019. The Chinese government told the WHO about a novel flu on December 31, 2019 and the WHO included it in their news on [January 5, 2020](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON229). The WHO declared it a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020.

Some of your statements are *ludicrous*.

&gt; 2021 yes we over marked covid deaths because theres no way of knowing how much or how little covid contributed to someone's death so if they were positive at all it counts as comorbidity and a covid death!

The CDC never said that. The CDC doesn't determine the cause of death, the doctor filling out the death certificate does. We know that the number was *not exaggerated* because the total number of deaths from all causes increased by *more* than the number of COVID deaths.

Here's a graph: https://i.imgur.com/3iLeBNa.png

Every single COVID death was on top of the number of deaths expected. Yes, the total number of deaths is the sum of those different stacked bars. 

&gt; 2021 covid started in a Wuhan virus lab

There's still no scientific consensus about the origin in 2024. No ancestor to SARS-CoV-2 has been found in the Wuhan lab or any of their publications or any of their data releases.

&gt; 2021 dramatic increase in heart issues with young people, oh well.

An increase in heart issues started in 2020, when COVID hit.

&gt; 2021 0 recorded flu deaths! It's because of masks!

Liar. There were 876 deaths involving flu in the 2020-2021 flu season, or 1,033 in calendar year 2021. We *know* there was a lot less flu virus circulating in the U.S. because *objective* flu tests came back more than 99% NEGATIVE.

There were other factors besides masks. There was a humongous decline in international travel in 2020, for example, and we've known for many decades that every year's seasonal flu come into the country from Asia.

According to the CDC computer model, an average of 34,200 people died of flu per year in the decade before the pandemic. (Death certificates show fewer deaths - [table](https://imgur.com/a/SAxI8Bg).

During the 24 month-long core of the pandemic, COVID killed as much as **28 YEARS OF FLU DEATH**. The fact that you think that flu deaths were counted as COVID deaths show that you have no clue at all about how many times worse COVID was.

&gt; 2022 80% of the country is vaccinated but then death rates arent going down!

Lie. Just utterly false. How dare you?

&gt; 2022 Pfizer's data states it was barely tested, isnt even a covid protein, didnt work at all, and hundreds of people died within days or weeks after the vaccine

Lie.</div>

You are extremely motivated and will make this day your best.

50 minutes in, and you feel exhausted and stop working.

You open Instagram to take a rest.

                                <div class="reply-body">When I was in the 4th grade, we had to write a short (obviously because 4th grade) essay on where we'd run away to after reading a book where the protagonist ran away.

My classmates provided examples like the treehouse down the street, grandma's house, best friend's house, etc.

Me? Costco. I argued in my essay that I could easily disguise myself in the rafters, and live off the free samples. When I couldn't get enough samples, it would cost me only $1.25 for a hot dog and a drink, which I'd happily eat multiples of, and given my savings I could sustain myself for a few months.

When the teacher was grading our papers at her desk, at one (probably mine, although that didn't occur to me at the time), she just started laughing so hard she started crying. 

When she was saying goodbye to me at the end of the day she told me she loved Costco too, and I was like, "RIGHT?!" When she walked me out to the car she told my mom she had a "Very creative and resourceful daughter." Apparently at open house that year she spilled the beans to my mom and years later I learned I made her day, but for real, I was 1000% serious.

Edit: As pointed out by u/suburbanmire, the book was "From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler." And now I'm feeling such nostalgia, TYSM!

Edit 2: since my mom died, I've realized she saved a TON of my written work from grade school. Next time I visit my dad I'm 100% going to see if she saved this essay. Honestly, it was one of my best and most memorable argumentative essays, growing up.</div>

Now he has a semi-official confirmation that o3 is an LLM, while OpenAI was pretty tight-lipped about even the most basic details of o1.

In particular, see the section "What's different about o3 compared to older models?"

Yes, LeCun is probably being overly strict in his definition of an LLM. And the people who are simply scoffing at LeCun are being dumb for not acknowledging the significance of the differences between o3 and prior models.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">First thing that came to my mind too, mostly because it is irreversible. Once those fat pads are gone, they are gone forever. 

We’re already seeing the effects of out of control Botox and filler use, but both of those are generally considered reversible. Perhaps not 100%, but significant improvements can be made if something has gone wrong. 

Buccal fat removal ages people so significantly (at least to me), and it’s all people in their 20s and 30s getting it done. As they age they will kick themselves for removing fat, as without that fat they are going to see deep lines and wrinkles much sooner and much more pronounced. No amount of filler or other surgical procedures will be able to replace the fat they had removed, and I worry they’ll all end up looking sick from their face being artificially gaunt (or freakish from whatever attempts may be made to try to restore the appearance of buccal fat).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I recently went down a rabbit hole of this influencer mom Ruby Franke who is currently in jail on child abuse charges. Her eldest daughter recently gave testimony on how growing up in an influencer family contributed to the abuse of her and her siblings and how there should be laws and such in place so that kids couldn’t be pawns on their parents YouTube accounts. I’ve never followed any parental influencers in depth but based on what I’ve read about the case I don’t get how there aren’t already laws in place.</div>

The TikTok “blackout challenge” has been linked to at least 20 child deaths over an 18-month period between 2021 and 2022, with most victims aged 12 or younger</div>

There's so much racism, toxicity, hate, that it is so unreal, the other day I saw a reel of African children being served KFC presumably at an orphanage or a school, and half the comment section is geniuses saying "the n\*\*\*\* factory" and "teaching them from a young age" I reported the post and many comments but their automated support said that there wasn't any offending content found. Seriously fuck Instagram, and how they push offensive comments and content to the top even with few likes.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Tiktok is the worst, because it promotes content which is so obviously staged, over-animated and “fast”? Like it really makes humans dumber and makes us all consume the “instant noodle” version of content, all calories but no nutrients. 

Twitter - much worst under Musk. Became a huge bot and content farm. It’s basically 90% AI and PR talking piece at this point. No real human contact and socialization. 

Reddit - is fine but the echo chamber and combativeness is a huge time waster too. You’ll realize you never really learn anything from Reddit. Also more bots than I think?

Youtube - long lectures and educational vids are the best.</div>
