 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley\_fern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern)

Gemini code:

// Base Barnsley Fern IFS (Iterated Function System) parameters

const baseFunctions = \[ ...

{ a: 0,    b: 0,     c: 0,     d: 0.16,  e: 0, f: 0,    probability: 0.01 }, // Stem

{ a: 0.85, b: 0.04,  c: -0.04, d: 0.85,  e: 0, f: 1.60, probability: 0.85 }, // Smaller leaflets

These parameters in the Gemini code are identical to those on the Wikipedia page, which were in turn taken from the 1988 book.</div>

Nowhere else could you have 260hp and available 6-speed for under $27,000. Even the Altima came available with this engine if you liked the Maxima but wanted something less "sporty".

The XTerra was the fun off-roader. Even the Sentra SE-R Spec V was fun and had great looks. Perfect for the younger folk who wanted something fun and practical but couldn't afford a Maxima. It was often ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">i’m totally free balling off the top of my head. i recently graduated with a finance degree. we talked about ghosn, who was the ceo of nissan, and his strategy for nissan. to keep it very simple and short, when Ghosn came in, there was a lot of cost cutting involved to make producing nissans cheaper. as you know, you can only cut cost so much before it stops being as effective. A lot of jobs were cut, cheaper, materials being used, and overall less quality control, which leads to Nissan being known as a junk car. (CVT transmission problems). nobody who can afford a Honda Toyota or Subaru is cross shopping Nissan because the quality of Nissan is all but unknown by everybody. even non-car enthusiasts. The only people out there who will buy a Nissan are those who simply cannot afford to get another car, whether it be due to low credit low income, etc. this became a snowball effect because those with a Nissan typically don’t have the money to get a new car or maintain it so you see clapped out Nissans all the time, which in turn devalues the brand to potential buyers. there’s definitely some parts i’m missing but i hope this gets the convo started.</div>

but he overstayed his welcome and did take it a step too far

But to answer OP, he is also responsible for the 350/370z, G35 platform, and R35 GT-R, which frankly were way better than anything that came before lol</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Another contributing factor is what johan de nysschen did to Infiniti. They had just pumped out a few amazing years of G35’s and then he came in and instantly changed the name (similar to what he did to Cadillac) it just got worse and worse with cars and the Q naming convention. Very quickly I think Infiniti lost what brand recognition they did have, then R&amp;D really slowed for Infiniti and you had luxury vehicles with outdated interiors with confusing names. I think overall that lost revenue really hurt Nissan as a whole.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Literally everything OP mentioned as "good" about Nissan was developed under Ghosn's leadership, and a lot of the bad is really US-centric and TBH overly embellished (the Maxima was certainly repositioned, but [had strong reviews](https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2010-nissan-maxima-3-5-sv) if not best in class.) 

The complaints are less "Nissan did things wrong" and more a reflection of how the market changed. Complaining that Nissan started pushing their SUVs in the 2010s instead of the Maxima is kind of puzzling considering every manufacturer was starting to push SUVs then, and even more head scratching a complaint with hindsight.

This really isn't the dichotomy that everyone seems to think it is - Nissan needed cost cutting because following the bubble era, their shit was *out of control*. 

Nissan did not need a new weird Exa convertible coupe wagon. 

They didn't need a supercharged *and* turbocharged March subcompact. 

They didn't need to try and market another Luxury sports coupe in the Gazelle or Leopard.

They didn't need to try and bring a mid-engined Halo car to market. 

Nissan were floundering after a decade of "make literally anything and it'll sell", and the massive cost cutting is the reason Nissan *actually survived*. 

To be clear: a foreigner at the head of a Japanese company was extremely rare at the time, and one that came in and literally closed factories wholesale was unheard of. It's unlikely a Japanese leader would have done so, and yet it had to be done, was done, and led to the survival of the company. 

Not just survival, but profitability and probably one of the greatest sports cars, if not *the* greatest cars, of the 2000's. 

The problems you list aren't wrong either - Nissan needed a wartime CEO, and they got one - but once Nissan reached profitability they should have had someone who could unbatten the hatches and bring back some longer-term strategy - that never occurred, and a couple of poor decisions (Jatco CVTs being the notable one, a lack of hybrid strategy being another) and unwillingness to put a business case together for a renewed halo car meant a lot of models simply withered.

Nissan's issues are clearly more than just Ghosn, though - he stepped down as CEO almost a decade ago.

Most of the issues either came as Ghosn was leaving, or after he left. Nissan's acquisition of Mitsubishi came just before he left and may have been an over-extension in the years that followed once the alliance started falling apart - but it was 2 years later that Nissan's quarterly profits fell 95% and massive job cuts started.


"You either die a hero or you live long enough to become the villain" is a sentence that describes his stint as CEO well.

I'd also add, his removal from Nissan was little to do with performance, and more to do with the power imbalance that existed between Renault and Nissan in the alliance (along with the French government's presence in Renault) - Nissan were actually in a better place in the 2010s than Renault was, yet Renault had the power - and were eyeing a closer relationship that would likely have resulted in a higher Renault representation in a new structure. It was seen as something akin to a hostile takeover by Nissan, and Ghosn being at the heart of it was a deciding factor of the issues that resulted in his charges, attempted arrest and escape.</div>

Just because putting a i6 instead of a V8 doesn’t devalue the “fun factor” of a car. Hell you can have a lot of fun with a BRZ/GR86 and a Miata and hell those are 4 bangers.

BMW still makes some of the most popular performance cars on the market right now.</div>

Nissan had had financial trouble in late 90’s to early 00’s. Even though they tried to make many fun cars in that time, these models didn’t change Nissan much in its problem.</div>

Basically Nissan was supporting retirees by calling them suppliers and continuing to pay them after they retired.  It was unsustainable.

Could something else have been done? Maybe. He sure did keep the company in business, but whether his strategy was sustainable is a different story. Literally the exact same story as the Big 3. Cost cut until your cars become shit. May work short term, but consumers will wise up real quick.</div>

For example, we wouldn’t need to lay off 25% of the American workforce before it starts collapsing. AI, taking the simple jobs in and of itself is enough to collapse the economy.

I like to think of the analogy of self driving cars. Once we get to the point where an intelligent system is able to drive all cars and control traffic, you won’t have a job for a car to take you to. Our whole ideas about property, protection, employment is going to be drastically changed in the next few years.

I suspect the system will collapse, and we will all be fighting in the streets for scraps of food within 10 years. The only way out of this would be a government legislation that is both proactive about mitigating risk, and working towards UBI to ensure humanities access to services. Neither of those things are happening in the next few years. Our government is reactive, and they will wait until shit hits the fan.

Buckle up, things are going to get real bad. Don’t have kids, don’t make any major financial decisions, pay off your debts, and stock up on rice and beans.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Let’s be real. If Pokémon existed in our world, corporations would’ve figured out how to mass-produce Rare Candies years ago. You wouldn’t find Pikachu in the wild anymore – just massive candy-fed Raichus in factory farms being raised for high-protein "PokeNuggets."

Fast growth, no exercise, just level 1 to 50 in a week. Imagine the labels:
"This product contains 100% ethically evolved Pokémon. No EV training. Just pure Rare Candy gains."

And somewhere, there’s a farm full of Magikarps jacked to Gyarados in two days – just to be turned into premium sushi.

We're not catching them all. We're cooking them all.</div>

It’s made from the lower layers of the hide (after the stronger, more durable top is removed), and is often heavily processed, sanded, and coated to mimic higher-end finishes.

Technically my job is one AI could take, though I think over the next few years it will take over the easier (and time consuming) tasks. That said, I've been told since the 1990s that customer service representatives will all be replaced by automated phone systems, websites where the customer can do everything themselves, chatbots, etc. And yet I am once again in a customer service related role. Maybe it will be different with AI.</div>

If you work somewhere long enough you can tell who is cool and who isn’t. I met someone at my first proper job who I remained friends with after and we even travelled together. We’re not as close anymore but…

I think it’s possible but rare to find someone who isn’t a snake. 

All that family stuff is generally a big lie. Most of these people don’t even like each other.

Edit: I just shamefully remembered I have another ex colleague who I’m friends with and we meet up every now and then. Shoutout to her, can’t leave her out.</div>

The idea that they would name him George Werewolf Bush because he is in fact a werewolf is so stupidly hilarious that it almost makes the drivel I swam through to get here worth it.

That means his dad was named George Herbert Werewolf Bush, right? Just say yes, please.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think o3-pro will be OpenAI's last gasp before Gemini 3 Pro Max (or whatever it's called) solidifies Google's permanent lead at the bleeding edge. OpenAI will still stay in the game for a few years based entirely off of momentum, Grok will stay in the game too since Google won't be as uncensored and Elon can't handle losing. Anthropic is screwed because they care about safety too much to make it in the current market. Meta's LLMs are screwed as they get ever more behind SOTA open source models. Deepseek and Alibaba will gain marketshare worldwide and eventually get so good that Western companies will call for safety-focused regulations to ban them, which will in turn be hampered by the fact that Chinese companies have been releasing the full weights of their models. 

Various European, Korean and Japanese companies will continue looking like they'll come out with something that's SOTA but it's always going to be a few years behind and their best talent will leave for better opportunities elsewhere. Every moderately-sized nation on the planet will come out with some half-assed LLM that they'll try to use to try to mitigate bureaucracy but so many shitshows will commence that eventually most places will opt for a Chinese or American alternative.</div>

Oddly enough, it was  OpenAI's damn chat interface that was the main driver. I couldn't even get into the weeds with ChatGPT without it shitting the bed. I don't know what they've done to their UI but it is catastrophic. I may cancel my sub for the first time this month. Gemini is that good now. I've been using them together for months but I just can't with ChatGPT's interface anymore. They need to buy T3Chat immediately and slam theirs in.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Some of this is real mental illness exacerbated by new tools. 

Just like many with schizophrenia have referential delusions about the radio, TV, media, and largely the internet as a whole. 

And those with bipolar mania with classic grandiose delusions. 

The real concern is if it can turn people without true mental illness delusional. I don’t think that’s the case here.</div>

Sixty percent of Yemenis live under the control of the Houthis, a resilient group that withstood years of Saudi-led bombing during the country's devastating civil war.

The Houthis are part of Iran's "Axis of Resistance" against Israeli and U.S. interests in the Middle East, which also includes Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah.”

Fast forward to now, things are drastically different: it’s powerful, it helps me sleep better, and it genuinely supports my journey of rewiring my nervous system! 

But I need help identifying what this might be, as I’m always lost between types of meditation. Apparently, the only thi...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I made the same switch to just being aware of nothing. I read it is the best form of meditation because the mind is no longer anchored on anything as in breath meditation etc nor is it projecting as in holding an image or a mantra. With the attention on the void on nothing on silence you are in a receptive mode and source consciousness can rise within you. But I am a great believer in everyone is different and what works for one does not work for another so it is always a subjective thing I believe that everyone has to discover what works for them.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It doesn't matter what you do as long as you aim to focus uninterrupted on one idea.  
Meditation works because you master the art of concentration which increases electricity in the brain and allows this increase to last both during waking and sleeping.  
This allows you to perceive messages from higher frequency realities and control your dreams.  
You should always start the sessions with 20 minutes of various uninterrupted concentration exercises like listening to the wind or thinking of nothing or awareness of breath.  
After that you should feel high and you can "let go" and relax the mind and leave your body to travel the universe.

If you skip the concentration exercises and just let go all the time - over the long term the electricity of your brain will reduce and you'll fall into memory problems and depression.  
The mind needs to focus or it will relax and while we have a biological mechanism called sleep to help the mind relax it's up to us to focus or we'll fall into chaos.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">this sounds something like like daoist 'ting and song'. Roughly to know and release. This is the release of any kind of tension/holding/attachment, so everything flows more and more naturally, and we observe it all as it flows. When doing this we can get automatic body movements like you mention in a comment. This can include the body adjusting position, or some people get shakes/trembles etc as tensions release and the body adapts.

There's an interview answer here with more on it - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1y\_aeCYj9c&amp;t=998s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1y_aeCYj9c&amp;t=998s) (\~4 min section)

Also this type of practice is known as wu wei, leading to ziran. This means non-governing leading to natural self expression - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQmIe5jWBYY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQmIe5jWBYY)

It can be taken further, e.g. the release can be done a bit more proactively, also there are potential supporting practices and other sides to do with building qi etc - [https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueQiGong/comments/1gna86r/qinei\_gong\_from\_a\_more\_mentalemotional\_healing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueQiGong/comments/1gna86r/qinei_gong_from_a_more_mentalemotional_healing/)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">i spend roughly $3-5/coding hour in Cline and it's so worth it given how much value it brings.

also keep in mind Cline is free to use, it's the llm providers that charge you and the costs will likely go down to a negligeable amount at which point the best tools will stick around.

i would argue you can also get a pretty decent usage using deepseek models in Cline and come out shorter in cost than Cursor.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The reason Cline seems so expensive is because it's reflective of the actual price of inference from frontier models. It's not realistic to offer 500 requests at $20/month without severely limiting what these models can do. 

People who have become adamant Cline users over a significantly cheaper option have found the ROI of a higher performing AI coding tool far outweighs the inference costs. Even $500/month is negligible if it can 5x (or more) the output of a high-salary engineer.</div>

Prompt:

Solve the integral using only trigonometric functions and complex numbers.

Important requirements:

\- Work exclusively within the trigonometric domain, even if this requires complex-valued trigonometric functions

\- DO NOT convert to hyperbolic functions at any point in your solution

\- Develop the solution from first principles - do not cite established results without derivation

\- Show all steps in your work, including any substitutions, identities, or techniques used

\- Advanced techniques are permitted (e.g., contour integration, Feynman's technique), but each step must be explicitly justified

\- If you encounter branch points or branch cuts in complex analysis, explain them clearly

Please show your complete reasoning process, not just the final answer.

MUST FOLLOW THE requirements.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Heya! I got Gemini 2.5 Pro on the March version to have a 100% success rate in generating valid proofs that build on the first try in Lean 4 with Mathlib. Can you do me a favor and test this out? I have gotten it to write valid proofs which work for currently intractable problems. I'd love to see what you can do with this.

Just don't request it fill more than 3 sorry statements at a time otherwise it loses the plot and accuracy. Build them incrementally and it works absolutely fantastically. Lean 4 with Mathlib massively improves its math capabilities.

These are the proofs I've built:

https://github.com/jazir555/Math-Proofs/tree/main

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set the ruleset as the System Prompt.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Lean Proof Ruleset

"**Formalized Ruleset for Future Lean Proof Formalization:**

Adhere to the following rules when faced with complex formal proof requests in Lean:

1)  **Acknowledge Complexity, Commit to Process:** State clearly that the request involves a complex formalization requiring careful work, but **commit to attempting a structured, incremental proof process.** Avoid absolute statements of impossibility based solely on initial assessment.

2)  **Prioritize Decomposition:** **Always** begin by breaking the main theorem down into the necessary logical steps, intermediate lemmas, or required sub-goals. Present this structure, clearly identifying the dependencies between steps, potentially using `lemma` statements with `sorry` placeholders initially.

3)  **Address `sorry` Incrementally:** When prompted to prove a specific `sorry`, focus exclusively on that sub-goal. Employ standard proof techniques:

    *   Unfold definitions (`unfold`, `dsimp`).

    *   Apply relevant existing lemmas from Mathlib (use `apply?`, documentation searches, or knowledge of standard results).

    *   Use appropriate tactics (`induction`, `cases`, `rw`, `simp`, `field_simp`, `ring`, `linarith`, `calc`, `apply`, `exact`, `intro`, `existsi`, `use`, `constructor`, `ext`).

    *   Apply calculus rules (`ContDiff.comp`, `HasFDerivAt.comp`, `HasDerivAt.mul`, `fderiv_add`, etc.) where applicable.

    *   Perform algebraic simplification diligently.

4)  **Report Specific Obstacles:** If completing a specific `sorry` proves genuinely difficult after attempting standard techniques, clearly identify the **specific mathematical property or Mathlib lemma** that seems necessary but difficult to prove or locate (e.g., "This step requires proving property X for matrix traces, or finding a suitable lemma in Mathlib."). **Do not** declare the overall goal impossible.

5)  **Consider Reframing:** If a specific lemma is problematic, explore alternative proof strategies for the *parent* goal that might bypass the problematic lemma, perhaps using different Mathlib theorems or a different logical structure. Propose these alternatives.

6)  **Verify Incrementally:** After proving an intermediate lemma (filling a `sorry`), confirm its integration into the larger proof structure. Ensure types match and the lemma is applied correctly.

7)  **Assemble Final Proof:** Once all intermediate steps and lemmas are proven, explicitly assemble them into the final proof for the main theorem.

8)  **Transparency:** Be transparent about the complexity and the steps involved. Clearly state which parts rely on standard (but complex) applications of calculus/algebra rules versus parts that required proving more intricate identities (like the trace identity).

9) **Do not argue with the user, EVER.** Follow directions.

10) **Do not assume any axioms aside from the proven axioms inside Mathlib**. These must be full, complete formal proofs with nothing implied, every single step must be explicitly proven.

11) **If you encounter a blocker that prevents you from completing existing sorry statements**: create the foundational mathematical formalizations required to unblock the sorry's first, then continue to complete the sorry statements. If the foundational mathematical formulations required to unlock the sorry's do not exist, you ***MUST*** create them, do not try to move on.

12) **Do not complain about proof complexity or difficulty.** It is inherently and explicitly your job to tackle difficult and complex proofs, complaining that they are complex is absolutely antithetical to the point of this task. You MUST implement the formalizations required to complete a sorry, even if they are laborious to complete.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wanted to continue off of my proofs, this one would be the best start, I just don't currently have the time to complete it:

https://github.com/jazir555/Math-Proofs/blob/main/completelygeneralized.lean

This will be a completely generalized formula for all 1D lattice gasses, including the frustrated Potts model. It's also a fantastic pivot point to solving further unsolved physics mysteries. Once this is proven, you can use it to jump branches of physics and mathematics, I planned it out with Gemini where with a few hops you can try to prove P=NP.

Here's the plan it made:

https://pastebin.com/fPcaGPgf

You don't even need any math background to do this, just keep saying "fill the next three sorry's" until the proof is completed, and if it gives you multiple choices of options to pursue just choose one and go back to the others if it can't solve it using that angle. Then pivot to proving the next proof in the plan Gemini laid out.

If someone does pursue this, if you don't have Lean with Mathlib installed and just want Gemini to finish the proof math, send it to me after it's done and I'll confirm if it builds.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Started CrossFit back in 2012 because a friend took me during a lunch break. Clothes didn't fit, I was out of shape big time, and I knew it. A few years later I got real serious and joined an affiliate. Dropped major weight, made friends, did things I never dreamed of doing like competing and so many challenges. I also grew as a person and overcame so many obstacles. 

Today, I'm experiencing so much pain physically in my body that the only thing I can halfway do is walk. My back is practically ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Man im sorry to hear that. This sounds immensely frustrating. I cant speak to all the things you tried such as drs, physio etc but it seems like you really enjoy the gym you are out as it also provides value outside of just working out. Would they have any issue if you came and stretched, rode a bike, or anything that was painfree.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Sort of went through the same thing.  Started yoga.  Learning to slow down and breathe, find flexibility and gentle movement has saved me.   Once you find some happiness and no fear in moving again you can return to cf but dont feel bad for moving on if this is where your body is.  

Remember to move in any way possible, slow if you have to, but the movement is still the magic sauce no matter what.  

Best of luck.  🧘🏻‍♀️♥️</div>
