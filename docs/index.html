I'll never understand people that scream "I CAN TELL ITS AI", good for you missing the larger picture.

In 2018 our past selfs would not have believed this was 100% generated by a computer and would have been considered magic. Thats how fast things are changing.</div>

Make them about something orthogonal to the topic - use it as a tool and not as inspiration, and use videogen models to create non-obvious camera shots that would be really expensive with normal technology, and see how well it does on the real market - my bet is that you're unlikely to hit 1M views or have many fans.</div>

I mean, from a technical side it's more than incredible, to be able to achieve this just from a set of instructions and nothing else. But the outputs are just bland, like corporate-training or stock video bland. Something designed to be almost white noise-ish.

It tracks because the largest part of what humanity produces artistically \_is\_ bland. Only the 99.99th percentile can be considered good or to have some sort of incredible artistic merit beyond being white noise.</div>

I don't care if you like him, this shit is just so bizarre and unprofessional. These accounts are posting things a 14 year old boy thinks is funny and cool.

What's even more bizarre is the Manhattan project wasn't just established by the US. It was a project with people from various different countries exchanging ideas and contributing. Something Trump is very much against. 

Now he's defunding education and scaring brilliant people away from the U.S., so I just want to ask any sane Republican about how the hell do you achieve this goal and claim to be winning when you're doing everything you possibly can to do the opposite?</div>

# What happens when you delete a chat?

* The chat is **immediately removed** from your chat history view.
* It is **scheduled for permanent deletion** from OpenAI's systems within **30 days**, unless:
   * It has already been **de-identified** and disassociated from your account, or
   * OpenAI must retain it for **security** or **legal** obligations.

  
Edit -- this is the official word, whether they're really deleting or not, I make no claim 🤷</div>

It implies an equality between us, that is simply not the case. 

If openAI is worth $300 bln, deepmind, even at its worst is worth $270 bln, and I would argue because of their status under alphabet, worth at least 30% more.

I'm no expert in specific meditative practices so I will describe it as I experience it.

I would enter a meditative state through following my breathing, until I feel like I can breath energy into my general pelvic area, and then feel an energetic release on the exhale. Continuing to do this can usually lead to an orgasm which is quite whole-bodied and intense as the build up happens in small inc...</div>

Like many, I've played around with GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc., and I've also felt that mix of awe and fear that comes from seeing artificial intelligence making increasingly strong inroads into technical domains.

A month ago, I ran a test with a lexer from a famous book on interpreters and compilers, and I asked several models to rewrite it so that instead of using `{}` to delimit blo...</div>

This comment perfectly encapsulates the unbelievable pace of AI advancements.

You doubted his experience because he supposedly used models FROM 6 MONTHS AGO.

As if it was completely ridiculous this could happen with old models from mere months ago, but not new models.

These LLMs allow computer science to enter the natural language domain, including law, regulatory frameworks, business communication, and person-to-person management.



I believe there's going to be a huge demand to upskill into people who can drive agents, create agents, and make them very efficient for business. I call them micro agents, and I'll probably post a video about it. If you have a task or thought process, you can automate it. For example, getting an address from someone, emailing them about it, sending information to a database, updating it, and sending follow-up emails - tasks where you need to convert natural language information into database entries. The LLM can handle and broker all those communications for you.</div>

We've already gone past the point of being able to say hah, well she has 6 fingers so must be AI.... And now the text flaws are starting to be ironed out. 

And with the recent release of veo 3's utterly insane power, almost all manual methods of determining AI likeness are obsolete. 

We now need software based methods like fourier transforms to detect AI content but idk shit about the AI detection field or how effective it currently is or how much research has already been done</div>

                <div class="post-content">The way I see it, API-priced alternatives like Cline, Roo, Claude Code, and Codex CLI could be 5x or 10x better than Cursor and it wouldn't matter.

10x better but 100x more expensive is not a good deal. And odds are they're like 3x better at best; let alone 100x better.

Sure, if you're already very wealthy, go for it. But if you're not, the trade-offs don't seem to make sense for me.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Your math doesn't really work. If 10x better means you go from earning $1000 to $10000 and 100x more expensive means you go from paying $10 to $1000, that's a really, really good deal.

But yes, if you have more time than money or aren't making money, then cheaper is better.</div>

In my case my job doesn't allow any AI tools (lol) and my personal projects, while successful and enjoyed by many users, currently make no money and probably never will. I acknowledge this is somewhat of a skill issue on my part.</div>

It doesn't try to do clever stuff like a vector DB for embedding similarity, it just uses CLI tools like a human would to do everything. Very expensive in token count, but very effective.</div>
