The following submission statement was provided by /u/AsInFreeBeer:

---

Submission Statement: *This is relevant to UFOs since the SR71 has been allegedly mistaken by UFOs during secret test missions. Also, the capability mentioned on the document could very well be applied to non-terrestrial retrieval missions.*

Perusing the JFK release at random, found this gem, a crash of an SR71 craft (OXCART) and all of its parts retrieved in 30 hours. In 1963. Photos taken were recovered from news personnel and media coverage was kept to a minimum. Just imagine the extent of these capabilities on present days...

That was during the bin laden raid. 

So I'm not sure how good these capabilities are, since they would have to cover the whole world. Additionally back in op example there was no internet and capability to upload images instantly.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not only that, but Ken Collins, the pilot, was at the crash site when the ranchers arrived and gave them the CIA-developed cover story for incidents near the Nevada Test Site (an F-105 with a nuclear weapon on board).

Fortunately, Collins also wore the standard flight suit because it was a low-altitude, subsonic test, not the high-altitude pressure suit they wore for supersonic flights.

If it weren't for someone on-scene dressed like a normal pilot and with a locally believable cover story, it could have gone differently.</div>

Submission Statement:

I am not the OP on this, 

I found the video here https://www.reddit.com/r/rusted_satellite/s/YbbtottFg3

It appears like the jellyfish / jetpack man / metapod from previous USP sightings.

So even if with due process, it's still insane.

So even if they are Venezuelan gang members, it is still most likely super illegal to send them to another country, that has nothing to do with them.</div>

Anything that involves GTD, keeping daily todo lists, categorizing, tagging, contextualizing, pre-planning, planning, after-planning, (edit: forgot to add under-planning and sideways-planning), daily and weekly journaling and writing other kinds of essays, Eisenhower matrixing, time-blocking, calendaring, time-tracking, writing notes, *copying the last month's unfinished tasks to the new month, by HAND, with PEN, in the Bullshit Journal (it's easy and productive, no need to hire 3 people to maintain that shit, 1 full time employee and 1 intern is enough),* etc., any of that is just destructive to any resemblance of productivity for me.

What the OP is proposing though, I like it. I think I can see why this works. I will try this approach, while adjusting to some of my personal preferences and circumstances.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You bring up an interesting point - Knowing these tricks and applying them may not be enough, sticking to them with consistency is discipline and is hard. It needs to come from within

I love OP's approach to building consistency in habits. That wasn't enough for me though. I had to change my mindset on what's important and whats not on top of habit building exercises. Discipline requires a mindset shift too - Listen to your mind, listen to your body and nurture your aspirations!</div>

A couple of extra things I do...
Do more mentally demanding things earlier in the day and easier things later. 
Minimise task switching by removing interruptions.
To do this I timebox the first 4 hours of my day to ensure I make progress on my big work items each day. Meetings go in the afternoon where possible.Only answer emails a couple of times per day. 
Take 5-10 mins break each hour to keep my productivity up through the day.</div>

After the big push to “Free Britney” and her well-publicized wedding to Sam that lasted 14 months, she seems to have faded from the public eye (no doubt a good thing for her), but it seems her loudest advocates (looking at you, Tessa a...</div>

Yes people are dumb but there's no way her parents were oblivious to what was happening to her by being in Hollywood. They turned a blind eye to all because they're shitty people. Then yeah I believe the mkultra stuff. Being drugged full tilt, she has mentioned lithium many times. Which can work for some people but can really mess someone up at crazy doses or when it's not needed in the first place. Being famous alone is enough to fuck up the most same person to begin with. The list is honestly endless as to why she is crazy. She's like a small child trapped in an adult body in an adult world. I bet she's on an endless loop of repeating the same actions and conversations. Mostly from when she was younger and could still function and remember things somewhat normally. The marriage to Sam is totally suspicious. I can see him being a handler or something along the lines of that. Nobody can save Britney because she's already long gone. You can't recover from that kind of damage.</div>

I think this happens to all people who become famous as kids. Fame seems to arrest your development so whatever age you are when you get famous, you’ll always be that age mentally.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Soon there'll be a time where it'll be illegal for doctors to work without AI. And a short time later they'll be replaced. Remember how barbers used to be dentist. Present doctors will be perceived like that.
Doctors, lawyers, teachers and accountants are in my top 10 which'll be replaced easily by AI.  It's just the nature of their work. Just cramming a load of data and based on situation, finding which piece fits best. AI is made for this exact kind of work.  Moreover they are limited by experience. A doctor may meet 10k-100k peopl in his life. AI model will have access to millions of people's data. And plus point, It doesn't forget anything. Once learned the entire species knows it in an instant. While we have to slave away a quarter of our life every  generation trying to learn everything from scratch.


There will be consultants. To deal with new situations. But not everyone can be a consultant.</div>

I agree with you if the super intelligence remains narrow. But if AGI is achieved, it will quickly lead to artificial general Superintelligence.

At that point humans directing these tools for their own purposes would be like a mentally deficient child running an applied physics lab.

                        <div class="comment-body">How would a proof of identity to access the web prevent AI images or videos? There's much simpler way that doesn't get rid of all privacy for no reason and it is cryptographic signatures.

Manufacturers of cameras and mobile phones will cryptographically sign photos and videos taken by the camera to prove their authenticity. Of course you can still pull off trickery but the whole point is to raise the bar for the amount of effort it is needed to fake stuff.

And it will be voluntary, there will be websites and forums that require participants to have the cryptographic signature and websites that are wild west. The internet doesn't need to die just because you got confused whether a bird picture you saw is AI or not.</div>

Already, most information, explanations, intellectual growth prospects, openness to new things and intellectual discoveries are facilitated by AI. If humans remove themselves from the equation, it will be even clearer. Reddit will become a desert (as StackOverflow became in a few months) and everyone will ask their AIs their questions.</div>

If I want to have a sensible debate without being insulted or talked down to, or even just discover something new, I now talk to A.I. not humans.

Like 90% of reddit has been fake long before AI, not even a single post in subs like r/AmItheAsshole was ever genuine, pure fantasy. The social media was flooded with fake video by paid actors long before AI existed the moment it was possible to earn money from views. Fake news has been a thing for...the same time news has been a thing. The average quality of discourse on internet is so bad that I am happy to actually talk to Claude or ChatGPT now because I get much more nuanced and intelligent response than I would ever get on the social media. The best future is when all of these big social media site crashes and we can get back to smaller sites like discord chat room with clear verifications and where we know the person.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">“I don’t think we should invade Canada or Greenland or go to war in Mexico.” is not a nonsense statement, but a legitimate political stance in 2025. 

There are some single sentences that I think are evidence of how fucked everything is, and this is one of them. 

“American citizens should not be [shipped to brutal prisons in third world countries](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/21/trump-musk-tesla-protests-el-salvador-prisons).” is one. 

“The richest man in the world, who himself has [billions in government contracts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/true-genius-elon-musk-subsidy-110500444.html), making decisions for the government after [contributing hundreds of millions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/31/elon-musk-trump-donor-2024-election) seems like it could be a little corrupt.” 

“People who [stormed the U.S. Capitol and caused evacuation during a session of congress, resulting in theft, property damage,  and deaths](https://youtube.com/shorts/9PRMK-FdeAY?si=YMoSy-Zg40ii9E02), should probably face consequences, regardless of if their views align with people in power.” 

“If [judges](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna197036) and [legislators](https://www.alternet.org/amp/maga-violent-threats-republicans-2671185178) are scared to do what they think is right out of fear of retaliation, is that not problematic?”</div>

This is despite Rogan calling us a communist hell hole and somehow knowing the conservative leaders name which is a red flag, and Shapiro threatening Canada multiple times on twitter. 

This is a propaganda arm messaging change. Rogan is not the friend of us normies. He's with the billionaire class now.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’m a white male, a US citizen, and I’ve travelled all over the world, including the USSR (back when that existed).

In general, I’ve found that border control people aren’t exactly the friendliest of types, but they’re generally businesslike, impersonal, and efficient about things. You show your passport, they wave you through, and so on.

Except in the USA. They’re inefficient, rude, and just generally unpleasant. They’re like the Vogons from Hitchhiker’s Guide, but with an extra dose of sadism and inefficiency thrown in.

This is based on my return trips in 2022 and 2024. I’d hate to imagine it now, so I think these travel advisories are worth considering.

Once you’re inside the country, I think you’d have a decent enough time.

But I’d suggest taking your tourism funds somewhere else for the time being. It’s a big, big, big world.

As Douglas Adams might say, the US needs to hang a sign outside our door:

The guy just couldn't comprehend that we had school holidays that weren't the exact same dates as U.S. ones so therefore I must have been lying. Silly, but also not something to get rude and aggressive with an unaccompanied child about. 

I was a well spoken and behaved, white, English child and and this was pre-9/11 too. 

 Got lots of friends and family in the States and love the people generally, No idea how the border people seem an entirely different breed!</div>

When I was coming home for Christmas one time the border patrol wanted to know how long I'd be in the USA. It wasn't a friendly, "how long are you seeing the family?"

Instead it was, "and what is the purpose of your stay and how long will you be here for?"

I replied back "as long as I want?"

And that's when I got pulled to the side and had all my stuff searched.

Every other country is welcoming, friendly (including even the ever so feared Muslim ones!) and always super helpful.</div>

I just read about a Canadian this week that was detained and held, and a German detained last month and is still being held. 
The German was just on vacation, and the Canadian had a proper work visa to be in the country, yet neither of them were able to convince anyone of anything. 

So yeah, I think it's less about getting in, and more about "you might not come back" that's going on amongst other countries right now. Lack of human Rights and due process.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">a lot of americans seem to have this idea that its 'just' 'orange man bad'. and as soon as he's gone (in 4 years, or 2 years if a stroke or something takes him out, or more likely 10 years or whatever) that things will just go back to normal.

but they won't... because its not trump thats the problem, its a fundamental issue within american society itself thats the problem. its the 33% of americans who made him president TWICE!  
its the fact that despite EVERYTHING he's been doing, he somehow STILL has nearly a 50% approval rating.

What that tells the rest of the world, is that even once he's gone, nearly half of americans APPROVE of everything he has been doing. why would we EVER travel to a country like that again?

this isn't a 4 year thing, this is damage thats going to last for generations.</div>

If you haven't read the ABSOLUTELY CHILLING story of one of our Citizens that was detained for 9 days by ICE, you should.

Most of us that are sane are not going anywhere near your country. It's run by dumbasses, totalitarians, and betrayers that lie and lie and lie and lie and lie.

P.S. Fuck your government. We like a great many of you as individuals.... but fuck your country's government. Fuck it with a rusty cattle prod.</div>
