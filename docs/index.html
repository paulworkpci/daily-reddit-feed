Which is very good, but having done that myself for a very long time, I did not experience the incredible changes that meditation can actually bring. I had to increase to one hour, then later twice one hour, to see actual great progress.

The problem with a 10-20 mins practice is that this is usually the amount of time during a meditation session where your mind unclutters.

                        <div class="comment-body">Great advice. I always try to tell people exactly this.

10-20 is better than nothing, but it's very unlikely that a beginner will even get to a real meditation in that time.

Sure, if you are an experienced meditator you'll be able to switch to a settled state in a few breaths. But that skill is built on years of doing long sessions. For the vast majority of beginning and intermediate practitioners, the first 10-20 minutes is for settling/untangling.

Trying to sit longer should be a priority for all beginners and intermediate meditators.</div>

Codex Cloud would run the application, run the test-suite or whatever - and constantly check the output. This is very powerful, as it gives the ability for Codex to interact with the live application.

However, it seem like CLI is not able to do this. As when a comm...</div>

When you’re arguing or have any sort of conflict, if it’s possible at all, adjust your wording so that instead of you vs the other person, it’s you and the other person vs the problem. Instead of “you’ve made this difficult” it’s “this is difficult now, how are *we* going to solve it?” This helps keep people from getting defensive, which makes them WAY more willing to LISTEN.  *Def...</div>

How many old varnish yellowed paintings do you think are in its training data versus the several hundred billion non-yellowed photos that are also in the training data?

Yeah, you might get yellow tints in your fake Renaissance paintings and that would make sense. But yellowed claymation? Yellowed web comics? Yellowed memes?

It's got to be intentional.

The latest image generation model is just bad. It's like working with the most unfriendly, lazy human designer you could imagine.

If it were a person, you'd walk into their office. They take their feet off their desk and look at you waiting for you to say something. "can I have a cool image of, I don't know, a bottle of mustard getting swallowed up up by an interstellar black hole in the depths of space?"

And they'll roll their eyes, open up Photoshop 7, do a Google image search, and give you this:

(Real output by the way, from a similar prompt)

They'll spot the grimace and frustration on your face and say "look I get it. This one fell a little flat. Instead of cosmic Wonder and the ferocity of a black hole we got clipart. Let's try this again. How would you like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah?"

"Okay sure. Give that a try"

And they give you  a nearly identical image. And you wonder if they're fucking with you.</div>

It’s about most other images being normally distributed in warmness/coolness. Aged varnish skews the distribution and it takes relatively few examples to drastically skew these models.

                <div class="post-content">I powerlift as my main thing these days. I drop in to classes once or twice a month.

For strength context, here is me back squatting 330lbs for 8. I'm a woman.

I didn't do CrossFit for a while (1.5 years of powerlifting), then came back to the one or two class thing. I am pretty good in longer cardio, as I bike commute, and it's very hilly where I live, so there are some hill "intervals" that are challenging that I go pretty deep on.

My takeaway lesson...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">All useful information. I agree with most of it. What I agree with strongly is the idea that barbell rows are extremely useful. They are and most gyms (probably every gym) doesn't program them enough. They should be a staple strength workout, at least every other week. I think the other one that should be done as often is Sots press.

I don't agree on the benching making front rack poorer. I have disproportionate push strength (bench and strict press) and I adapted pretty quickly to proper front rack, bulk and all. What I found though was that thoracic mobility becomes considerably more limited as even with a strong back your pecs are pulling way more towards the front than normal. Your scapulae just can't do what they should do without a lot of coaxing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You said you disagree, but in the latter part of your paragraph, you note the phenomenon that is secondary to building a good bench to interfere with a front rack position. Which is from building a bigger bench. "Your pecs are pulling way more towards the front than normal". I don't see that as a conflict to what I said, but what might be more aligned is "the work towards building a bigger bench had an impact on my ability to get into Oly lifting positions as easily. This is because I wasn't actively getting into those positions on a regular basis to negate the impact of the strength from bench work". Unless I am misunderstanding you? I've had high level Oly coaches agree with this, as well l.

Important to note, as I was building a bench, I took a step away from Olympic lifting. I did not do the every other day mobility work alongside this training that would have likely kept up access to the Oly positions. I definitely would have at least done some front rack holds every now and then, I think.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Agreed that extra strength is one of the best things you can do for cf.

Entered a box with a powerlift background and could already oly lift more than 90% of the people there. 

The %  in a wod wil get smaller and smaller when you get stronger and stronger. Les fatique and muscle fiber engagement.

For my gymnastics straight arm pulldowns do wonders. Kipping movements especially.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Awesome post. I've been doing CrossFit for 11 months (after never working out before) and just started adding more strength and mobility accessory work.  Have been powerlifting curious but not ready to make that jump yet.  I know I need my cardio even though I suck at it.

If what you say is true about the 3 plate squat I'm almost there. Up to 265 on bs as of a couple months ago.  Just tried 375 on DL and almost got it but need to try again with less reps before it.

Good to know about barbell rows. I don't do those very often.  I'm more focused on 30 deg inclined benching in my accessory work doing 60 reps every other day alternating dbs and bbs.  I really need it for now to build my pecs and biceps which didn't exist ever.</div>
