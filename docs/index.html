                                <div class="reply-body">Because the MAGA movement (and Tea Party before them) don’t actually care. I forget the name of it but their goal is essentially to overload people’s minds with slop at such a pace that we can’t possibly refute it in a timely way, and by the time we’ve made our rebuttals they’re onto the next thing. It doesn’t matter whether or not it’s true and it doesn’t matter whether or not it’s hypocritical.

The most recent Charlie Kirk stuff is a great example. They flooded the airwaves with it being a left wing attack before anyone could possibly know. And by the time the left wing influencers and politicians started forming clear counterarguments to this they’ve moved on to the next thing. Charlie was already about 5 right wing controversies ago, including Trump bitching about a Far-Left escalator.</div>

There are so many better options available including open source models. With Gemini 3.0 releasing soon this could be quite bad for them, if Google keeps the same price for the pro and flash models.</div>

There are lots of task in a project that doesn't require an expensive model like a quick refactor, documentation etc. Most real world project uses a mixture of different models for different tasks with the most expensive ones reserved for planning and overall design. Even claude code used 3.5 Haiku for lot of cheap tasks which was a much much worse model and expensive. I switched to a cheap oss model for those tasks and actually saw better performance while saving me a lot of cost.</div>

And this model is 5x cheaper than Claude Sonnet. I don't do vibe coding at all. I have codebases of considerable size that need maintenance and improvements; which is what AI will be used for after the vibe coding gimmick proves unprofitable. AI does all development while I review results and make architectural adjustments.


My point is, in a stable future do you think most developers will still be better served by a $10k/month Sonnet 4.5 vs a $50/month Sonnet 3.7 equivalent? </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">For me, it feels like a hyper awareness of everything around me.. over the years, I’ve realized it’s a state where I’m not using top down categories to perceive the world. So I stop creating a world of “clouds” in “sky” and I just see the weird shapes of the whitish things and I’m noticing all the shades of blue that make up the background.. or instead of seeing “broken eggshell”, I notice how each one has a unique crack.. it feels like being very aware of all the details of the moment.

The other thing is, and what helped me, is realizing this state isn’t one you need effort to hold onto.. the effortful mindfulness is often imposing your own idea of what it’s supposed to be like.. and that’s quite cognitively heavy, and why you lose it so easily at the first distraction.

So for me, it feels like being very conscious or very awake. It doesn’t feel like golden delusions and angels. I feel very close to reality.

Edit: sorry, I was on my phone and it didn’t show me all the text after the question! In regards to thinking in meditation. There are different schools of meditation, but to put forward the zen view. It doesn’t fucking matter. Whether you try or not try, it doesn’t matter at all. The useful thing is to notice the part of you that notices the part trying or not trying. That part of you is always there. It is there whether you are having holy or horny thoughts. Whether you are meditating or doing a poo. That is not to disparage it.. but to try to convey that this is the part of you that is the whole of it.</div>

I showed my brother it a while back, he instantly jumped ship because free ChatGPT sucked. A month ago, he complained how these chatbots are terrible, only to find out he randomly switched to ChatGPT and got the shitty free model for some reason.

Later that night, he writes to me that what took hours with no result from ChatGPT, Gemini solved in a single prompt.

I jumped ship back from ChatGPT when Gemini 2.0 Flash dropped and with the relase of 2.5 Pro, I'm gladly a paying customer. Deals like 6 months free Google AI Pro plan with the purchase of a Samsung S25 phone is something no other companies offer.</div>

[https://www.cyberdaily.au/digital-transformation/12441-atlassian-terminates-150-staff-with-pre-recorded-video-ai-customer-contact-solutions-rolled-out](https://www.cyberdaily.au/digital-transformation/12441-atlassian-terminates-150-staff-with-pre-recorded-video-ai-customer-contact-solutions-rolled-out)

**Atlassian CEO and co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes sent the video titled “Restructuring the CSS Team: A Difficult Decision for Our Future” to staff on Wednesday morning (30 July), informing them that 150 staff had been made redundant. The video reportedly did not make it seem that the decision was difficult, but rather said it would allow its staff “to say goodbye”.**

**I guess firing people didn't lift the stock price it just continued to crater, so lets try "no actually we are explanding and going to hire lots of people because - GROWTH!"**</div>

I don't agree with the way the culture is changing in Atlassian either, but the engineering roles are still pretty safe / secure if you can get in and tough it out.</div>

So no, we will not stop calling you Nazi's and fascists because that's exactly what you are, and unless you're extremely strongly coming out against this shit IE firing and ending these people's political careers, then I don't even care if you've not personally been caught yet, if you align with this shit then you find this shit acceptable and the label fits.</div>

Ignore the fact that neo-nazis called trump their white savior. Ignore the uptick in violent neo-nazi hate crimes when he was president that he never condemned. Ignore the fact that Trump has erased every female and POC in leadership from the government website. Ignore the fact that trump got rid of all documentation of tuskagee airmen. Ignore the fact that he's trying to get rid of juneteenth. Ignore the fact that he is targeting DEIA. Ignore the fact that he plans to end the voting rights act. Ignore the fact that he said he would never trust a black guy to count his money. Ignore the fact that he has fired women and POC in leadership roles. Ignore everything you see and hear. Ignore the fact that Trump said he envied Hitler's military due to their loyalty to him. Ignore the fact that people of color have been warning white people about him for years. None of it has to do with prejudice.</div>

It's classic bait and switch until they can eat up the entire market and jack up prices once they feel they can lock you in. Uber did it. And so did Cursor.</div>

Benchmarks are using quite generous thinking budget, so expect to use it in thinking mode as default to achieve that result.

My initial thought is it's... meh?

I feel dejavu like we already see this with Haiku 3.5 where it is quite good for the price in Anthropic family, but released too late.

Competitors already have better offerings. Most people probably ended up not using Haiku and forget about it.</div>

Humans are wired with mirror neurons, which cause us to subconsciously mimic the posture, gestures, and tone of people we feel a connection to. By consciously initiating this behavior, you can rapidly generate a feeling of safety and trust in the other person (a state often called limbic resonance).

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree. I noticed a friend of a friend doing this upon our first meeting (I took a drink, she took a drink, I crossed a leg, she crossed a leg, etc.) and it wasn’t subtle like unconscious mirroring. Every time I changed my posture, she would instantly do the same. It felt as if she were trying to gain my trust, however, it had the total opposite effect where I became more wary and kept a closer eye on her.

To be quite honest my read on her was that she was trying to make a good impression and it didn’t come from a place of malice; yet her doing this *still* had the knockoff effect of causing me to feel cautious rather than comfortable.

Overcompensating by mirroring can oftentimes lead to the outcome people are trying to avoid.</div>

I bet ChatGPT could get an AI to better generate than nano banana since nano banana has a weakness when it comes to translating to different styles.

But Seedream is going to be hard to beat. Namely because it's as good as nano banana with 0% censorship. Who can match generating images without concern for blocked images? Possibly only open source.</div>

I may have fallen off Rogan's podcast and stayed for the drama but I liked how the Right and Left were constantly clashing against each other without the mods banning everyone.  As frustrating as it could be it was nice to see ALLLLLLL the different factions that made up Rogan's base yelling at each other. 

But now it just seems like "my side" won.  I barely see any push back or dissent anymore.  Like every post just seems like a circle jerk for "my side" and it's boring.</div>

Instead, Joe's exact words were to "fuck you man, fuck you people", accusing him and Biden of trying to start WWIII. </div>

Their API charges $0.1 per second (for the standard version). If their costs are half of that, they’re now spending $0.75 per video. 

That’s several dollars a day at least per user, and upwards of $22.50 per day per user (at 30 videos a day). 

Considering potentially millions of users already, this is one of the biggest giveaway of all time.  </div>

For over three years character AI community begged them for a NSFW toggle only to be ignored every time and with openAI about to do it they must be in full panic mode. Keep in mind this isn't some random literal what competitor. This is literally OpenAI. This is serious threat to cAI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, I can see that. Though, objectively, cAI’s LLMs have been behind the curve for a while now, haven’t they? I remember when it first appeared, it felt like magic, but now its conversational ability is far behind 4o. But still somehow they’ve kept a fairly large audience — ironically a lot of them seem to be minors who want to talk to game characters. If ChatGPT institutes a lot of age-gating, cAI probably isn’t in danger of losing that audience.</div>

My only other guess is that a halo brand trickles down and increases the brand reputation of Lexus, etc. but jeez it’s depressing to realize that there are enough ultra wealthy individual’s out there to justify a whole new brand.</div>
