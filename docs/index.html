let's grow this thread.

Here we should accumulate all good and recommend options and the thread should serve as a reliable source for getting surprising good FREE API Options shown.



I'll start!:

I recommend using the Openrouter API Key with the unlimited and not rate limited Deepseek/Deepseek R1 0528 - free model.

It's intelligent, strong reasoning and it's good at coding but sometimes it sucks a bit.  
I Roocode there is a High Reasoning mode maybe it makes things better.

                        <div class="comment-body">RooCode + Gemini Flash 2.5 doesn't really let me down much for coding. Usually takes just a bit more requests and every now and then needing to look up a module that's not working to find a working version (looking at you moviepy &gt;.&gt;). Orchestrator mode also doesn't work well with flash 2.5 from my tests.

Although recently I've just been using it more so as a tool in automated scripts. It makes as a very powerful summarizing tool + report generator. Much more thorough reports than its older 2.0 flash model.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; For now, at least, Porsche doesn’t have any specific further plans for another roadgoing 963, but that doesn’t mean it might not make one. “Of course we will not build exactly the same car again because of the nature of the project… but as I said before, never say never,” says Urs Kuratle, head of the Porsche LMDh project. “As Porsche, we like to sell cars first of all, and if there is an opportunity or possibility to do it again at a later stage, why not? But at the moment, there’s nothing planned.” So if you want one and you’ve got oodles of cash to spend, get in touch.

Being able to recognise that a product or rebrand or whatever *Isn’t Meant For You (And That’s Probably Okay)* is a level of maturity that escapes the vast majority of Reddit commentators.

&gt; “A lot of changes have been made to suspension and systems to make it more tame and more like a road car, but still keep the pedigree of the 963 race car,” says Jonathan Diuguid, managing director of Porsche Penske Motorsport. “On top of this, what the restoration group in Atlanta has been able to bring forward is a level of quality that is not aligned with the race car at all, whatsoever.”

This car as a whole is an exercise in restraint, and I applaud Porsche for taking on the challenge. Let's not pretend that we wouldn't drive the snot out of [a road-legal 917K](https://youtu.be/Wxhmrvxnbjw) if we had the cash to burn.</div>

Porsche says it had to get special permission from the French government to get a plate, and it is only being used to promote Le Mans, after which it is going right back to a museum (save for special occasions when it will be put on private tracks, like the Goodwood Festival of Speed).

All of which is to say, this isn’t a road car. Not in reality. It’s a promotional sculpture.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">While I agree it's definitely more a promotional sculpture than anything significant, this shows that Porsche is actively developing things like its hypercar program and might tell us that we are maybe a few steps closer to the third of the holy trinity.

Also knowing that Porsche has the capability to potentially make a road going 963 as long as they put some more effort into it is a very cool prospect to me as someone who has been watching a lot of WEC</div>

                <div class="post-content">I’ve been meditating daily for a few weeks now — nothing fancy, just 10-15 minutes of breath-focused sessions using an app. Some days I feel calm afterward, other days I feel like I spent the whole time wrestling with thoughts.

It made me wonder: for those of you who’ve been doing this long-term, **was there a moment when it “clicked”?**</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Been obsessed with it for a few months so probably no where near as long term as others, but it clicked with me when I realized the purpose of it and started seeing the effects manifest in real life. Being able to realize when my feelings and thoughts are hijacking my reactions and give control back to the part of me who is more logical and calm has been amazing. Also it has helped me face many demons and get over things that have been bothering me for a long time. It helped me let go of so many things and gave me a new perspective of life. Love it.

Edit: to address the click that you are talking about, I'd say it's understanding the real purpose is to take what you practice and use it in your daily life. 

You say sometimes meditation is wrestling with your thoughts? I believe what you're supposed to do in that situation is detach from the wrestling and observe your thoughts, don't engage with them just watch them free of judgment. 

In real life something troubling might happen and you'll be in the same situation and at that moment your meditation training will kick in and you will be able to detach from the troubling thoughts, observe them and decide with a clear mind what to do next.

Hope that helps, good luck on your journey 🙂</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I started mindfulness last September (2024) out of desperation because I was so depressed, anxious and paranoid. I started with this guided Vipassana that rings a bell every 5 minutes as a reminder to come back to the breath. Zero expectations then and zero expectations now. I missed roughly 4 sessions in 2024 and haven't missed any in 2025 so far. 

The first thing to go was the depression and anxiety within a few weeks. Then the cravings for fruits and vegetables was next and I haven't eaten meat since. Then I stopped drinking alcohol in December. Then stopped watching p0rn and smoking weed. Then stopped playing video games. I've been addicted to sleeping pills for 20 years. I no longer crave caffeine or take sleeping pills. I went into it without any expectations and continue to have expectations. I became interested in Buddhism and my body and mind automatically began to practice the 5 precepts. All of these positive changes were autonomous without any choice. That is the crazy part. I've been an alcoholic and addicted to weed and p0rn since I was a teen. None of these positive changes were planned or choosen they just happened organically. I'll never stop. I believe if I stop ill revert back to my bad habits and addictions. Oh yea I've also lost about 80lbs 100% clean and sober without help of diet pills or supplements. I wish everyone spent 15 minutes every morning to just follow their breath. Our world would be much nicer and compassionate.</div>

I try to call or text them often to stay in the loop and make sure everyone is ok but it quickly became overwhelming trying to remember their stuff on top of everything in my own life. So now, as soon as they mention a test or appointment I put a reminder for that day on my phone.

                        <div class="comment-body">"Set reminders" in general. Anytime I want to do/remember something in the future i set a reminder. Sometimes i'll set a reminder a year in the future and be pleasantly surprised when it comes up. It's a good hack just to not have to worry about forgetting stuff when you get into a good habit of doing it.

Can't get my wife to do it. She'll be like "Dearest hubby, remind me tomorrow to do ..." and i just have to roll my eyes. Like, just set a reminder lady... We have the technology.</div>

I just had a sit down with my boyfriend about how I have done a *lot* of work managing and coping with my ADHD, so him going "sorry, adhd, forgot" was him more *choosing* to forget. Like a deaf person pointedly closing their eyes in a conversation.

"You see me pull out my phone *everytime* I need to remember something, but you choose to not try and do the same, so 'I forgot' will no longer be accepted as a general excuse when we both know that you have the tools to cope with poor memory." Because he forgot something major after I reminded him and my feelings were hurt.</div>

I have an Android and he has an iPhone, so I just schedule a text to him whenever he mentions something so it'll arrive as a reminder at the appropriate time. He's a very organized person but is often juggling a lot with work. He could definitely set his own alarms or something but the simple act of having a loved one look out for you makes you feel more connected.</div>

It has been public knowledge for many years that Trump flew on Epstein's private plane (aka the "Lolita Express") on several occasions. Some of the numerous posts about this on r/conspiracy can be found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=Trump+on+lolita+express&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).

To date there is no evidence that Trump visited Little St. James island.</div>

I feel like he'd be more likely to try it if it were a girl. He's been a creep for a VERY long time and it's ALWAYS been women. If he diddles boys, he keeps it waaaaay under wraps. 

I feel like Elon would probably know that. Plus, dude used his boy as a bullet shield after Trump was attempted. I don't know if I would call Elon a "good" parent.</div>

He's said Trump has pushed for an interview in the past but Joe refused because he would not be allowed to ask certain questions. 

But then Trump comes on, and were supposed to think Joe just forgot to ask about Epstein or Jan 6?

Joe literally went from being famous as the "ask anyone anything guy" to a full blow fox news ball washer, his podcast truly jumped the shark with that interview</div>

That way driver and paramedic could be assisting different people, with the bot ferrying things as requested.

Toss in some AI and it could likely know the most likely things needed simply from the call over the radio.

Also make its hands a defibrillator so it just has to rip clothes off and place its hands for the shock. (But then it may kill people lol)</div>

Existing IDEs such as Cursor/Windsurf are powerful, but they focus on providing general solutions that work across different languages, tech stacks, and codebase sizes. As a res...</div>

I would think your target market is not coders but people who "know a little code".

I wonder, in that case, should the code still be the main focus of the window. Or do those kinda of users care more about things other than the code. Like make the deployed end result.

                        <div class="comment-body">I find the numbers for o3 very interesting.  The 100 coupled with small drops at 16k and 60k cutoffs, then suddenly a much larger drop.  Is this by some aspect of the secret sauce of the model, or that they are throwing the kitchen sink at o3 and allowing it to consume as much resources as necessary to keep context?  Or maybe both?  I don't know enough about underlying architectures and RAG so if there are experts out there that can comment.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Some of these percentages are just simple fractions, like 60k for example is all fractions out of 6. So if a model gets 6/6 it will get 100% there, but 5/6 brings it down to 83.3%. Since it's one shot it's pretty much down to luck in many cases, if you run it back 10 times for each model you'll get much more consistent results. That's why I've never been a big fan of this benchmark, there's no consistency in the results.</div>

As a baseline: how much less weight would you have to do here if you were trying to execute this complex with (near) perfect form? Everyone's form breaks down at their limits, but it just seems like you're well past them here. Don't get me wrong, this is a tough complex, OH squat/snatch requires all the components: strength, mobility, balance...all the more reason to take up the weight VERY gradually. I'd hate to see your progress stunted by an injury.</div>
