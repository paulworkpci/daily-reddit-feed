                                <div class="reply-body">I can fully understand where Carmack is coming from for the most part. His stance is pretty pragmatic and logical. 

However, *do* people have a good argument against the whole “pulling the ladder up” angle tho? Because it *is* kind of a convenient stance to take from someone who’s already “had their turn” in terms of having a prominent career in software engineering. I can totally see how this type of attitude could definitely come off very “fuck you, got mines”-coded. Especially when it comes from people that aren’t really as “at risk” in terms of being made irrelevant by AI. (Carmack will always be a legend in the industry, so AI is basically playing with house money for him. That isn’t true for the upcoming engineers hoping to have a similar career to him tho.)</div>

Look at that silly argument. “Oh it makes games that would require the work of multiple devs into something that needs less people working on it!!!”. As if that’s not literally the history of technology since forever.

What are these folks even wanting to see? AI not existing? Surely it’s not something that stupid, surely they know that never in the history of mankind have we ever collectively decided to not pursue advancements in a technology.</div>

No, stupid luddite, I spent the entire day renaming material instances and changing compression settings in textures today to fix someone else's mistakes when they were making characters. Unreal's a big mess and it requires a colossal amount of work still.</div>

Trump let them do it on steroids and is now going to either let Israel annex it or WE are going to annex it.

No establishment political party is clean here. Our tax money helped fund this. Yes, October 7th, but we don't have that side as a client state and at ANY TIME America could have stoped Israel from causing this genocide. 

This is why AIPAC donates to BOTH sides and why we need to get money the fuck out of politics!</div>

lol no, the party whose leader ISNT posting AI memes about the hotel he's going to build in Gaza after he "removes" all the Palestinians is fucking squeaky clean in comparison.

"Both sides", Biden didn't stop a genocide......but thats not even REMOTELY the same as proposing a quicker genocide using American troops and posting memes about the hotels your going to build on the rubble, get the fuck out of here

This is literally how it happens; "Yea, the guy now is literally proposing a genocide and meming about, but the last guy wasn't great either"</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/TommyShelbyPFB:

Knapp and Corbell posted a full detailed breakdown along with flight tracker data of the incident:

[https://www.weaponizedpodcast.com/news-1/uss-jackson-tic-tac-uap](https://www.weaponizedpodcast.com/news-1/uss-jackson-tic-tac-uap)

The part that stood out to me is **"synchronized and instantaneous departure - indicative of shared communication".** All 4 crafts were observed departing at the same exact time with instantaneous acceleration.

What's the evidence for this?  It's also kind of a meaningless statement since all acceleration is instantaneous essentially.  It's the magnitude of acceleration that matters</div>

See, checkmate!” 

They miss the point on purpose. 

There’s a MAGA dude in one of my group chats irl &amp; there’s a couple MAGA sympathizers/both sidesers in there &amp; when we voiced that we’re just legitimately concerned for America &amp; want the best for our country &amp; what we’re seeing is not that… we were met with memes &amp; feet pics on the beach thanking Trump for allowing him to afford a vacation. 

They won’t actually discuss anything in good faith because they’re aware their operatives are operating *in* bad faith. They don’t give a fuck. It’s time &amp; has been time for a long time to burn the right to the ground domestically &amp; globally. They are not working toward the same goal as the rest of humanity. Nor are their ideals virtuous. </div>

In 2023 the U.S. Navy encountered four “TIC TAC” shaped UAPs off the coast of California. Personnel from the USS Jackson in the CIC (Combat Information Center) filmed them. One of the vehicles of unknown origin was observed exiting the water, transitioning directly into flight, demonstrating transmedium capability. No flight control surfaces or conventional propulsion signatures (heat plumes, exhaust) were detected. The UAPs executed an observed instantaneous, synchronized departure. Operator, purpose, capability, origin and intent are unknown. The craft remain unidentified.

We scroll for hours on reddit because we feel like we're learning and discovering. We're not though. For example, I follow a few philosophy subreddits. But if I truly want to learn about philosophy, I should read a book or watch a lecture from an actual academic expert on the subject. Not randos on the internet with no actual expertise. 

I use to have the same problem with YouTube. I'd watch a ton of video essays and while some of t...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’ve reached the same conclusion as well. I used to believe that I need to consume as much content as possible to get the maximum information possible to form my opinion. But this was having the opposite effect: it was frying my brain and confusing me and overwhelming me because it was just too much. I was also forgetting things a lot in my daily life because I was consuming too much information, like I would forget whether I had already told my husband something and was telling it to him twice and he would tell me that I had already told him that. Then I started to realize that my brain can’t hold nor process that much information, so I started becoming more intentional about it too. I have become very intentional about using YouTube. I only watch it for my daily yoga and meditation practice and if ever I specifically want to watch one video once in a while. I watch a good movie about once a week. And I am aiming to replace all my video consumption by books and novels, which would encourage deeper thinking and give my brain the time it needs to process things. I think that our brains are not meant to be consuming as much content as we are exposed to nowadays because I believe that it’s literally driving us insane, so, as Cal Newport extols, digital minimalism is crucial to retain a little bit of sanity in this overly fast-paced world.</div>

and more ppl need to hear this

most “learning” online is just performative consumption  
you *feel* smarter but can’t recall a thing a day later

and yeah—random opinions from strangers don’t make you wiser  
they just make you louder inside

real learning has friction  
books  
lectures  
long-form anything

and real entertainment? enjoy it guilt-free  
but pick the good stuff, not the brain slop designed to keep you scrolling

junk food is fine  
but stop eating out of the trash

Do you ask yourself that ever? 

Why do Americans need a meme leader? Is that the mental age of your citizens collectively?

Trump isn't the problem. He's just a symptom of a country that is so uneducated and so anti - intellectual that any dumb idiot can mislead them and actually win.

Very few developed countries even entertain politicians like that. Y'all elected him twice - even after he was convicted of destroying the country and many personal crimes. What is your population like?</div>

Now you're saying Google's version is significantly better? Damn... I'll be wasting all my money on LLMs at this pace lol. I've never been able to study as effectively in my entire existence as I am right now while using these tools. They're rapidly progressing from being quirky toys that can do some tricks to actually useful tools that help with a lot of things and produce high-quality outputs. LLMs may not become AGI, but they sure as hell can be great pocket assistants. People who say they couldn't find any use for them whatsoever are seriously lacking some imagination or prompting skills.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I’m a 28 year old guy and I’ve started to realize I don’t enjoy being on my phone like I used to.

Growing up, I didn’t have a computer or internet access. The only time I got online was either at school or when I went to my grandma’s house. No cable either, just basic TV with maybe 5 channels. Then in 2012, I got my first smartphone (I was about 16), and that’s when the phone addiction really kicked in.

For over a decade, I loved having so much access to the internet. I was constantly watching...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I would go so far as to argue that the last time the web could  be considered on the whole "fun" or at the very least "not terrible" and somewhat diverse in terms content and places to visit was the mid 2010s. I think once smartphone use age became the norm and social media began to out-pace actual websites created and maintained by people or organizations, that's when things really took a turn. 

I'm thankful for reddit to an extent, at least niche communities on here, as well as educational content on YouTube, despite that place having its faults.

Everything else feels like a doomer hellhole for people who can't or won't break out of.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Totally agree. I remember having video-chat with my girlfriend on MSN when we were in middle school. Using blogs and having fun discovering this new thing that called "Facebook". I am not sure if it is the nostalgia of being an innocent teen with hormones driving me around or internet being this more unoptimized but interactive place to connect with other people around the world. Maybe it is both.

Over the years everything gets more "optimized" like the app and website designs. And while these optimizations are good as quality-of-life improvements for the user, there is also the optimization of UI and algorithmic design that is done to keep the user engaged on the website as much as it can. This does lead to entrapment of people against their free will since no one would expect such thing from a simple app or website. It literally is a self-discipline check that is very hard to get out of unless you are aware of your usage of time all the time.  Especially for young people. It is like an addiction.

It is the same case for video games. They were pretty much play and finish type of games at the start of the century but now there are so many predatory practices to keep you engaged and spend not only money but all of your free time, it is nuts.

One must be aware of their usage of these virtual creations. I am starting to believe as if I am the Neo and we are all living in the Matrix. I feel sorry for the newer generations who will never play in the soil like we did. They maybe won't even know what is real anymore with all this AI stuff going on.   


Lastly, I wish we could limit which part of which app we could use. I didn't sign up for story and endless feed options on Instagram. They were added later, and I literally can NOT turn them off. Opting out of using Instagram is an option but it also would limit my already very limited social interaction with few people across the country. We need countries or organizations like EU or WHO etc. to start a campaign against this "endless feed" algorithms to snap people out of this doomscrolling behaviour or we will create lazier generations over the years.</div>

It is hella expensive. Lots of premium things, like having a whole beach to yourself, are free.  Necessities like houses and clothing are insanely priced.  

Because NZ punches above its weight in many areas like sports and film, that is what people see, and forget it’s an island in the middle of nowhere.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I live on Crete sometimes.  It really is a pleasant place to be pretty much year round.  But having a tourism-centered economy does mean some things:

* Outside of “the season”, or for about 8 months out of the year, 80% of the businesses close.  It can be damn inconvenient, but travel and rental cars are cheap.
* When everything IS open, things are crowded and everything costs more.
* A large percentage of folks on the road only have a loose understanding of where they are, where they are going, and the local customs and laws.  Most people do well enough, but a small minority are aggressively bad drivers.
* Random people might walk down your driveway and take pictures of your house or the view.  You have to kind of roll with it.  It isn’t always easy for some folks to recognize they’ve left the winding, confusing street and wandered down someone’s drive.
* Be prepared to experience the best and worst of humanity whenever you are out doing mundane things, like a trip to the hardware store.


Pro-tip:  If you are a tourist but don’t want to do “tourist things” that’s fine… great even… but be patient with the guy who doesn’t speak your language and isn’t used to dealing with you.  Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that everything is catering to tourists.  For example, if you want to go buy fresh fish from the fishermen at the pier, they are happy to sell to you, but they are fishermen, not a service and not a market.  Follow their hours and go early in the morning, be polite, pay what they ask, and don’t complain about the selection.

                <div class="post-content">Fascinating work coming from a team from Berkeley, Nvidia and Stanford. 

They added a new Test-Time Training (TTT) layer to pre-trained transformers. This TTT layer can itself be a neural network. 

The result? Much more coherent long-term video generation! Results aren't conclusive as they limited themselves to a one minute limit. But the approach can potentially be easily extended.

Maybe the beginning of AI shows?

Cogvideo 5B isn't that small, there's also a 1.3B Wan model. The paper said they used 256 H100s for 50 hours. If you could rent a H100 for $1/hour that would be $12,800. Realistically, it would probably be more like $2-$3 but still that's not an unreachable amount and if you aimed for shorter videos, used a smaller model like Wan 1.,3B it possibly could be even lower.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yea things are changing fast now. SOTA models took a year to release, now every three-four months we see new SOTA models coming out.  o1 came out in December and o3 will come out this month most likely. GPT5 will come out July. I guess video gen models will also advance a lot as there is a huge interest in them. Seems like AI really is taking off right now. Won't be surprised if next year we see every 2 months the release of new SOTA models. I remember years ago when I entered the sub and Dall-E 2 release was special. Now people are not surprised by 1 minute of ai generated Tom and Jerry. I think this year we will have fully AI generated episodes - 20 - 30 min. And next year movies.</div>

When I was younger and lived at home and when I lived in a dorm when studying, I was always awake and out of bed as soon as my alarm clock just as much as thought about ringing.. I think the noise and presence of other people made me feel like I couldn't wait to get up and out to them.

Now I live alone and I can't for the life of me motivate myself to get out of bed. I sle...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Apart from getting enough sleep, something that helps me is to make plans to do something that genuinely excites me as soon as I wake up — no matter how unconventional it is — before I do anything else in the morning.

**Here are some examples of things I've done:**

Create and photograph three new outfits for my capsule wardrobe

Listen and dance to my favourite Selena song

Watch 30 minutes of that movie I haven't had time for

Plan out my dream website layout

Bake (I lucked out...the people I live with are totally fine with this, otherwise I wouldn't do this)

Walk somewhere that I find beautiful once the sun comes up

Give a powerpoint presentation on something I love to an audience of no one

I find that following through on my plans initiates an early bias for action and a sense of hope about life that lasts throughout the day.

ETA: if you have a vision board or a document containing your dreams / visions / goals / plans / desired future self, looking at it when you wake up can also make you feel more energized. Though back when I had depression, I found my vision board to cause more anxiety than hope, so feel free to do what you know will evoke a positive response.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Honestly, I used to rely on motivation too, but like you said—some mornings, laziness just wins. What changed for me was *setting intention the night before*. Not just a vague “I’ll wake up early,” but asking: *What’s one thing I want to own tomorrow?* That one question helps align my brain before I even go to sleep.

Also, I started looking at mornings less like a chore and more like a foundation. Even just five minutes of stillness before the chaos (emails, notifications, etc.) changes how I show up. I’ll sip coffee, sit in silence, maybe journal a bit—sounds small, but it’s huge. One of the best things I learned from studying athletes like Kobe is how they treat mornings like game day. Not flashy—just consistent, focused, and intentional.

What really helped me was breaking it all down into micro-goals. Like instead of “be productive,” I’d tell myself: just write *two* sentences. Or stretch for 3 minutes. Tiny wins that build momentum.

Now, I kinda geek out on morning routines, lol—I even wrote something about how successful people layer habits in a way that builds that discipline muscle (because motivation is too fragile). But for me, it’s all about setting the tone early: be still, feed your mind, and move with purpose.</div>

Edit: I started a deep research report when I made this comment so around 6:00 pm, and it just finished, 38 minutes later. Interesting since OpenAI Deep Research doesn’t like to go as high usually (although for the report in question, I used ChatGPT took 78 minutes to answer the same questions.)

After writing that and being excited to check the results, this is what I got 😃

All I did was give it my supplement stack and ask it to tell me about each ingredient using the latest scientific research. OpenAI Deep Research actually gave me an amazing answer, and while this is only my first attempt at using Google’s new version, shit like this makes me not even want to try it again.

Edit 2: Turns out you don’t choose “Deep Research” in the dropdown menu, you have to choose Gemini 2.5 Pro, then press “+” and choose Deep Research there. Confusing for sure, but I’ll try my prompt again and update this comment one last time. Thanks u/Gaiden206

Edit 3: the report I got from the actual Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Research was extremely good, especially because it looked at over 300 sources while ChatGPT Deep Research only used around 45 sources for the same query. I’m still reading the report but it’s definitely *that* bit more in-depth than OpenAI’s version, so this is very promising.</div>

You need to select 2.5 Pro from the model chooser and then select "Deep Research" from the "+" button in the prompt bar.

But seriously though its not even a hyperbole anymore. Every second german article you can read in german newspaper goes along the way "oh my good young people dont wanna work anymore. Why are they so stupid and lazy ?" Hmmm maybe because the average wage is between 2000-2500 Euros after taxes working full time while the average house price starts by 400000 Euro ? Surely thats just a random coincidence.</div>

It has barely started touching the digital world in that aspect. Some more time is needed for it to reach the physical world and replace producers there too.</div>

To the point it would take several years to recover. If it happens in multiple at the same time, it would certainly be more than enough to justify UBI, although I'm not sure it would be enough to actually make it happen. It might also be too late at that point.

In any case, there's no need to even get to 80% unemployment or even 50% really, for things to really go to shit.</div>

As people start losing jobs to an automation wave that's not going to stop there needs to be something in place to smooth the transition. 

Bonus point, if a robust system gets put into place and humans continue on as we are without roving bands looting and the like. The upper echelons are less likely to resort to drones and/or manufactured pandemics to get rid of them. 

Then we move into the status game era where those who need the validation vie for attention of the masses. The scalar no longer starts at destitute on the street, it's comfy middle class circa 2025 with better healthcare and entertainment, but there is still plenty of rungs on the ladder above that for those who wish to climb.

This is a completely fictitious story made up in 2002. The $2.3 trillion was part of three audit reports in the year 2000. The Inspector General found $2.3 trillion in accounting entries that didn't meet accounting standards and told DFAS to change how they were doing them. There was nothing about missing money. DFAS is headquartered in Indianapolis. The office of the Inspector General in 2001 was about half a mile from the Pentagon.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I did this after being frustrated by long waits with a particular doctor.
Got there for my appointment on time. Waited…waited…waited.
Went to desk and asked what the delay was and she said - I can call to try to find out where she is.
I was like “she isn’t even here?” She wasn’t.
