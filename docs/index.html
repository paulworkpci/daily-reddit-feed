                        <div class="comment-body">I'm more conservative than the average of this sub and I think that AGI is likely to still take more than 10 years to be achieved and to mature, however, in only a decade or two, AI + robots will likely be able to do the majority of tasks a human can, as in probably at least 3/4, if not more. They'll possibly be able to do half or more of all white-collar jobs by the end of this very decade. In 20-40 years, it's overwhelmingly likely that no human will ever again be able to even dream of competing against AIs at anything whatsoever. True general intelligence systems will be born superhuman by virtue of speed and information accessibility alone.

This is the *most* profound transformation in the history of our species, period. Whenever people complain about being scared, they absolutely have VERY legitimate reasons for that and they shouldn't be gaslighted into believing they're not at risk. People just have to immediately stop coping and being delusional and start really pressuring their politicians to do something about it ASAP. "Humans need not apply" is now closer than ever, and getting closer each month. 

It's also clearly the case that even the rise of AGI/ASI is not necessary for this massive transformation to cause widespread chaos and panic -- highly capable, interconnected narrow AIs will almost certainly be enough to do the trick just fine and to achieve the performance of top-tier employees without ever getting tired, sick, pregnant, needing a salary, etc. Robots also seem to be improving at a high speed and their dexterity will soon match the human level or at least be "good enough" for most or nearly all current economic tasks that require such ability. 

Altman isn't the best example, but he did say something true: "...if it goes wrong, it can go QUITE wrong". And there are few better ways to ensure it goes wrong than to deny the problem exists right, right?</div>

Once, the manager asked a maintenance guy that took a quick look at the place how it looked and his response was "immaculate".

Including carrying around a copy of the very detailed move in report I had made before sending it when we moved in. (It included documenting the burnt marshmallow on the floor in front of the fireplace when they had told us they wanted us to wait to move in until the 1st so they didn't have to prorate our rent.) Considering that the deposit was more than what I earned in a day, it was well spent. 


We did get charged for a lightbulb, but it was a specialty size and would have cost me just as much to buy a pack that I wouldn't need in my next place. </div>

It did need both of those things but not because we lived there for 12 months. This was after I paid for landscaping and a professional cleaning when we moved out.  I just remembered they sent me a bill for an additional $500 afterwards. Never responded to them because I wouldn’t have had the place cleaned at all if I knew I wasn’t getting any of my despot back.

- VSCode
- Roo Code
- Aider

Everything else seems redundant compared to these. Whenever I hear about a new tool or editor, it always has the same exact features or it's just another VSCode fork that could've been an extension. The only fork that's kinda okay is Trae, but most of the changes I like aren't even related to its AI, plus it's closed source.

Are there any tools out there that's actually worth trying or are these 3 the peak coding assistants and editor?</div>

From an artist's perspective, it was a completely novel visual style. It had phenomenal texture and this great 70s sci-fi + luminism vibe. It took a handful of influences and created something new. 

Once this AI hate dies down, I hope to see museum exhibits in this style.</div>

I've been working with AI long enough now that I've been through what you just described, and you literally do get to a point where your account history understands you well enough that it's hard to make it just be goofy on its own again. lol 

Sometimes stuff works too damn well, like a kid that grew up so strong they don't ever need your help any more, and sometimes you kinda miss it.</div>

This comment perfectly encapsulates the unbelievable pace of AI advancements.

You doubted his experience because he supposedly used models FROM 6 MONTHS AGO.

As if it was completely ridiculous this could happen with old models from mere months ago, but not new models.

These LLMs allow computer science to enter the natural language domain, including law, regulatory frameworks, business communication, and person-to-person management.



I believe there's going to be a huge demand to upskill into people who can drive agents, create agents, and make them very efficient for business. I call them micro agents, and I'll probably post a video about it. If you have a task or thought process, you can automate it. For example, getting an address from someone, emailing them about it, sending information to a database, updating it, and sending follow-up emails - tasks where you need to convert natural language information into database entries. The LLM can handle and broker all those communications for you.</div>

Just by making that one change you'll be viewing things differently.  Without having to think about it, you'll have a sense of direction because now you're looking at a map instead of an app.

He was so excited about this match he spent the entire following lecture talking about how cool this was and replayed this scene and a few others several times.

AI is Manhattan + Moonshot + 90s dotcom craziness. 

Also, it’s not just the US; China is also in the game.

I don't care if you like him, this shit is just so bizarre and unprofessional. These accounts are posting things a 14 year old boy thinks is funny and cool.

What's even more bizarre is the Manhattan project wasn't just established by the US. It was a project with people from various different countries exchanging ideas and contributing. Something Trump is very much against. 

Now he's defunding education and scaring brilliant people away from the U.S., so I just want to ask any sane Republican about how the hell do you achieve this goal and claim to be winning when you're doing everything you possibly can to do the opposite?</div>

We've already gone past the point of being able to say hah, well she has 6 fingers so must be AI.... And now the text flaws are starting to be ironed out. 

And with the recent release of veo 3's utterly insane power, almost all manual methods of determining AI likeness are obsolete. 

We now need software based methods like fourier transforms to detect AI content but idk shit about the AI detection field or how effective it currently is or how much research has already been done</div>

An AI cannot sit in court and argue. An AI cannot reason a large code base. An AI cannot dig through corporate accounts. An AI cannot make sure a building gets built and doesn't fall down.

For you to say 'oh it's gonna take ALL white collar jobs' just shows you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Stop listening to the techfluencers and go ask people in their industries how AI is going to help them.</div>

                <div class="post-content">So for the past couple of months, I’ve been under a lot of stress at work. Heavy workload, constant pressure, and I wasn’t able to deliver the kind of quality my bosses expected. That led to some serious backlash. Even at home, I couldn’t shut my mind off — overthinking, stressing, even dreaming about work.

I shared all of this with my dad, and he suggested I try meditation again. I had done it before, but honestly, I used to get bored and never took it seriously.

This time, he explained it di...</div>

If you only let got of expectations because you know that this is the only way to experience this state again, you'll have a hard time. I was there, and whenever I got closer to very concentrated states, I would drop out of it due to excitement. 

Blissful states are not what meditation is about and they are neither better nor worse than any other state you can experience during meditation.</div>

I find Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche’s instruction to not mistake an experience of meditation for meditation really helpful. Meditation is conscious awareness paired with the contents of consciousness. Sometimes the contents will be peaceful or blissful, and other times chaotic. As long as I recognize the awareness I am meditating and enhancing my wellbeing.</div>
