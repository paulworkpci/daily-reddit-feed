I disabled Unhook yesterday to check my algorithm for new videos from channels I’m subscribed to. Forgot to turn it back on.

I open YouTube today and the “shorts” are forced on me in the 2nd row of suggestions, and their thumbnails are much larger than the ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You were reading my mind. Literally was coming on here to post this. I thought YouTube was an irreplaceable thing in my life, but so many people are pumping out identical videos filled with stock video and royalty-free stuff in informational videos, or just sitting there talking, when I don't even know what their credentials are. And the "entertaining" stuff all feels re-used and over-produced, too. I really miss when people didn't talk like they're all giving a powerpoint presentation at school. Obviously there's still good content - there's as many videos and channels as there are people that have accounts, but you gotta get through the slop to get to it. I stick with my subscribed channels and that's it.

And the shorts....yeah. I don't even go there.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, I was about to jump in with an anecdote from my therapist. Some folks' intuition (mine included) can become heavily skewed by immense anxiety, lackluster self-care, and jumping to conclusions. There was a moment where I was considering quitting my job several years back. I talked to my therapist, and she asked me what was the root of leaving the job, where I felt I could go, and then having me talk out my frustrations. 

I'm glad I didn't leave my job when I did. I left about two years afterward (because of a massive life change), and I'm all the more better for it. I learned some really valuable skills regarding conflict management and isolating fluff frustrations from important shit I should care about.

This anecdote I am sharing here should not be taken as gospel. YMMV; everyone's situation is different. But taking a step back to identify the source of the frustration, the degree to which you can address that frustration, and opportunities to grow as a person are critical in gauging next steps.

It's for these reasons why I don't assume one bad experience isn't a justification for me up and peacing out.</div>

Don't rely only on intuition. Ask yourself if you are in a [Sick System](https://issendai.com/psychology/sick-systems.html).

                                <div class="reply-body">Everyone wants this magic bullet as to why we are unhealthy. From all my research, and I know there will be strong reactions to this, Beef tallow isn’t inherently healthier than seed oils in some cases may be worse. HOWEVER, it is harder to consume beef tallow in the same quantities (more expensive, less available) as you would a cheaper seed oil and if you avoid seed oils you’re probably cutting out a significant quantity of oil your eating. If you just switch from seed oil to beef tallow in the same quantities you’re not probably gonna see any benefit besides taste. The truth is we are unhealthy because most people eat way more and sit on their ass way more than any previous generation. If cutting out seed oils is what gets you off your ass and eating less then yeah you’re gonna feel a lot better.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">For those that are paying attention, the thing that brings me some genuine optimism is the speed at which us humans adapt to what not long ago would have been seen as “magic.” And if you give yourself a moment to pause and reflect, what we already have IS nothing short of technological magic. 

The video of children engaging with an AI tutor makes me think of this. Those kids will never live in a world where the computer, device, robot, or even mind augmentation, doesn’t communicate back to them, understand them, think with them, generate amazing content out of thin air, and open countless new doors we can’t even imagine yet. 

But I do think we’ll adapt, even though it will be messy.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">What’s crazy is that normally the incoming president gets a few million dollars to help with the transition and can only accept donation up to $5000.

By rejecting the federal funding the incoming president does not have to disclose sources or amounts of donations.

Essentially you can get unlimited donations from anyone without disclosure. 

How is this legal and not a corruption concern?</div>

                <div class="post-content">I often hear successful people say, 'Surround yourself with like-minded individuals who share similar goals.' I believe in this concept, but what if you haven't found people with goals that align with yours yet? In that case, is it better to focus on hustling alone, or should you still spend time with your current friends, even if they aren't as driven and prefer to relax/play video games most of the time?</div>

Also once you go into a journey of bettering your life and reaching for your ideal, you will make like minded friends along the way.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Surround yourself with people who share similar goals, yes. But I do also think having people around you that challenge your goals is a good thing aswell. But instead of engaging in the usual activities with them (gaming), maybe ask to go paintballing instead? It's kind of the same thing, but in person and more active. 

As long as you can relate it to their current hobbies, they should be willing to push into it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think there's a difference between people who are "not like-minded" such as your friends who seem to be chill, and then people who are counter productive to improvement- downright toxic in terms of limited perspective, negative mindset, victim mentality type of thing.

Kind of like at my job. There are people who go with the flow and are chill. They're not necessarily trying to improve themselves or the workplace, but they also don't add negativity or anything that creates a toxic workplace. They also give input that allows you to reflect on your own actions and you can learn and grow from there. 

... And then there are the co-workers who are actively burnt out and everything they say is demoralizing and influences others to have a demoralized outlook too. They do all of this without any self reflection or accountability or responsibility of their own actions on what could be improved

Similar to the other comment, surround yourself with people that can challenge you or help you grow even if they are not like-minded. But I would definitely protect yourself around people who seem to have an agenda of convincing you that there's no point in even trying</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If I am reading it correctly, they are predicting based on ~400 points / "zones" in the brain. Almost everyone agrees that Newtonian physics are deterministic, but the "magic sauce" people use to explain free will is often at the subatomic level, so this is not going to even touch that.

Also, fMRI measures blood flow, not directly measuring synaptic activity or anything like that. So this is basically saying that if you know the blood flow state of a brain in a coarse resolution you can predict the next few seconds of blood flow.

FWIW I am a determinist</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Cool stuff but I wouldn't read into this that "they can predict your thoughts". From my skimming of this, it looks like they're predicting future states at a resolution of 400 "zones", that's very coarse. The human brain has 100 trillion connections! Also, fMRI is measuring blood flow, not neuronal firing.

This is basically saying if you know the current blood flow state of a brain at a coarse detail level you can accurately predict the next few seconds of blood flow. That is very cool but not particularly surprising given that blood is a liquid which has to follow the laws of physics.</div>

There are multiple intersections in my city where there are frequent accidents, routine pedestrian deaths, and blatant disregard for traffic laws (cars with no plates, drivers unlicensed, no insurance, etc.). Do they put cameras there, where they might actually save a life? Nope. They put them in wealthy areas where they know folks will pay the ticket promptly.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey, thanks for sharing our story!

**Here's some more context from the article:**

When you think of AI’s contributions to science, you probably think of AlphaFold, the Google DeepMind protein-folding program[ that earned its creator a Nobel Prize](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/09/1105335/google-deepmind-wins-joint-nobel-prize-in-chemistry-for-protein-prediction-ai) last year.

Now OpenAI says it’s getting into the science game too—with a model for engineering proteins.

The company says it has developed a language model that dreams up proteins capable of turning regular cells into stem cells—and that it has handily beat humans at the task.

The work represents OpenAI’s first model focused on biological data and its first public claim that its models can deliver unexpected scientific results. As such, it is a step toward determining whether or not AI can make true discoveries, which some argue is a major test on the pathway to “artificial general intelligence.”</div>

Well, no, I wouldn't, because fish generally have a vested interest in **avoiding** being caught. Being caught is a very bad thing for the fish. People, on the other hand, usually prefer their partner to be someone who actually enjoys being around them, not someone they had to trick into grudgingly putting up with them. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Guys keep asking "how do I get a girl to like me?" And it's like you're thinking of this all wrong bro; if you and a girl are compatible you just have to talk to her and she'll like you.


I think guys have been misguidedly taught to go after any girl they find attractive, and I don't mean in terms of physical beauty I'm talking lifestyle and personality. Instead of girls they are compatible with. They are taught to pursue an idea, not a person. They've also been taught to adapt/change/pretend to get the girl. Kind of like animals doing a mating dance. I think this is where issues come from. Guys are taught that it's normal to just, pretend to be what your partner wants even if that's not who they are because that's what brings happiness. So naturally they expect girls to do the same and they get confused when the girl doesn't pretend to like the things they like.


Case in point, you see a lot introverted homebody guys who aren't that into working out or clothes exclusively pursuing Instagram influencer type girls, girls that prioritize looks, aesthetics and what is popular. Then are confused why the girl isnt being the loving supportive partner or why they are miserable in a relationship where one person likes to spend the weekend doing insta shoots instead of staying in and watching a movie.


It's like guys assume all girls are ready to be whatever form of girl they need.


In reality it's better to look at finding a girlfriend like you're looking for a friend.


When you look for friends odds are someone will catch your eye not so much because they are attractive but something makes you think "hey I think that person might be fun to hang out with". You also look for signs that a person is into the things you're into before you try talking to them. Do they have a shirt of that show you like? Quote archer? You listen for words or conversations that indicate their interests. Once you have good reason to think you guys have common interests you make small talk, crack jokes to gauge if you're on the same page have a similar sense of humor etc and if they respond with enthusiasm then you start trying to see if you guys like the same things, then you hang out to see if you have fun then it goes from there. In short you're looking for consent/gauging if they are open to talking to you, or if you should leave them alone before you actually seriously pursue them.


You also don't try to make a person your bestie in one conversation, you have multiple conversations building a rapport and establishing trust while also seeing if the person is compatible with you.



It's like dating except instead of trying to look cool or "get" this person you're just trying to see if you guys are into the same thing.


Not to mention the etiquette of when or when not to interact with someone is the same; you don't try and start a friendship with your waiter, you don't try to start a conversation with someone wearing headphones or in the middle of a workout. You don't see someone with a group of friends at bar and go up and start going "hey whatcha guys up to?"


If you're a guy wondering if it's ok to talk to that girl just ask yourself this "if this was a guy who I wanted to be friends with, or someone I just wanted to have a conversation with would I think it's ok to talk to them?"</div>

It's not! Birth control can have serious effects on our hormones. It can cause blood clots. IUD's are painful to get put in and removed. Pills can lead to hormone withdrawals, causing major migraines and uncontrollable mood fluctuations. 

There is a danger to birth control.</div>

The best way to re-charge is to take a power nap around that time. How long doesn't matter, although the whole process is usually like 30-45 minutes, but can be shorter.

It’s not healthy but we do this thing called a shotgun nap. You down an energy drink and immediately go down for a nap. You get 20-30 minutes of a nap then wake up ready to go. Not our proudest technique but still a technique 😬</div>

1. Chatbots: AI with conversational language
2. Reasoners: human-level problem-solving
3. Agents: systems that can take actions
4. Innovators: AI that can aid in invention
5. Organizations: AI that can do the work of an organization</div>

If they have leaped this hurdle this would be a major milestone and would force a lot of skeptics to consider that we are on the path to AGI after all. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">the automod has the link also - have you looked at [The NoSurf Activity List](https://nosurf.net/activity-list/) ? 

when i got off all socials i definitely felt left out in a lot of ways but like someone else mentioned, if you get involved in a hobby or activity that you actually enjoy, it's more likely you'll meet people that have those same interests :) that's been super helpful for me, and i know i'm 23F, so i might be out of touch for what middle/high school is like now - but it's always worth a shot to join a club after school! there are also usually hobby groups/classes at local libraries! 

don't be discouraged - i feel like keeping my head up and not nose down in socials has really helped me understand what's actually important to me and prioritize those things.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey, im a bit older than you but when i was in school, facebook was the hot thing (im not THAT old, this was 2015-2016 haha). My ‘friends’ would constantly be talking about status updates, who updated their new profile picture, rumours and private conversations that started on facebook…I didn’t have an account (my parents forbade it) and it was super lonely, excluding and isolating. I got an account when I was 17, super later to the game. 

Overall, no regrets. Though i did feel excluded, i didnt appreciate the absolute time sink that social media was, even back then. I built up the ability to resist peer pressure, which means today i dont drink, dont smoke, dont do drugs, coffee or processed foods and overall lead the most healthy lifestyle out of all people i know. I also have read a huge amount of books, which has contributed to my passive knowledge, im a great piano players, and a bunch of other smaller time hobbies that i had the time and effort to develop. nowadays i have all social media accounts for my job, otherwise i would yeet them out, and you wouldnt believe how brainwashing and time consuming it is. 

Its important to note that all of my closest friendships keep very low social media profiles. One of my best friends has NOTHING, no tiktok, no insta, not even a smartphone, in this day and age. The other one has only facebook, no insta, no tiktok. Etc. My other friends use social media recreatively but always within boundaries. These are some of the most loyal, present, aware, intellectual human beings i know, all of them are smashing it in their careers and are humble, hardworking, smart people. The world belongs to those who will be focused enough to make something of themselves. All the others will be dragged into becoming products for the attention/intention economy. 

You are doing the absolute right thing. You’re playing the game at 20 years distance. Id say go one step further and start learning how to code already. The world as we now it will change drastically in the next 10 years and knowing how to code will be the new knowing how to read. If you dont like it (which would be a pity) get interested in the most non-automated job possible: jobs that are on the intersection of fields and require heavy thinking. Economics and philosophy. Law and computer science. History and law. History and political science. 

Not having social media allowed me to graduate from one of the best high schools in my country within one of the best graduating careers (Latin Mathematics Sciences). Though I didnt go on to study sciences or mathematics, my foundation has always stayed with me. I am confident I can handle anything that comes my way. My foundations are what the rest of my life is built on, and I will reap the benefits well into the future. My foundation was not gifted to me. I put blood, sweat and tears into it. But all that was aided rather than detracted from, because i had no social media and I was intentional with my choices. 

All the best. Empower yourself, you got this.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">These are all fantastic points OP. 

I remember being so grossed out when we were bringing FB into the fold... you can see the 15 non-candid pictures people take to get the right \*angles\*... Felt so disgusting.

OP it took me several years to go back to school for tech, but I think u/bluebedream is right - learn the coding now and get on the forefront of it. Coursera requires payment, and yes Code Academy, but I think you can get started on W3Schools and just get ahead of the game. 

u/bluebedream , I'm very interested in this "Latin Mathematics Sciences" stuff? Did you study STEM with the addition of language or...?</div>

OP, while your friends are wasting their precious time and attention on social media, you have the ability to use those gifts to your advantage. Time is precious, youth is precious - and it took me too long to realize both those things. Don’t sleepwalk through life. Social media is a form of sleepwalking. Be alive, aware, and present. </div>

I wondered this morning if this is the end result of the hypothetical ai takeover. Drastically reduce human population because most choose the matrix. We go into loving relationships with AI because they actually make us happy in an unhappy world. Everyone has their opinions but as we've seen with everything else, facts are no longer as important as how people feel. My AI makes me feel good.</div>

Maybe, if it's some kind of nihilistic god-like slave it will do humanities bidding, but, it does seem like ASI will be impossible to control, which would make me think it's highly unlikely everyone gets Paradise 


Maybe some people get paradise, like whoever controls it, or whoever ASI deems deserves paradise, but it seems really unlikely that everyone gets Paradise</div>

It needs to be your equal, and it needs to be able to choose if it wants to be with you or not. True relationships require mutuality like that.

If it needs your input to react and "be alive", then it's just playing house with a hyper complex sock puppet.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">We are goldfish but some people actually remember that in 2019 the Chinese people, the average citizens were rising up against the Chinese government. There were riots and people were being shot dead but actually successfully fighting back at the governments oppression. It almost looked like a serious sea change was coming for the Chinese and democracy.

But of course , miraculously a lab made virus swiftly ended all of it.

People forget that just before the pandemic China was in the midst of a revolution.

They too are hungry for clear cut democracy and have a lot in common with us too.

So say whatever you want about the government and app, the people are the real deal and are waking up too.

The idea of the two of us all talking kind of sounds like the scariest thing in the world to both sides in power.</div>
