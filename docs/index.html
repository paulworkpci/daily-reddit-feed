Look… we all do things for money… but a lot of these guys are already rich. And sure, not every comedian or actor needs to be super political… but taking a huge payday from murderers and then smoking a cigar and laughing about it is not exactly brave.

Same energy as the people who laugh and say protesters are losers, who get all bent out of shape and complain about them (remember Iraq War protesters ‘hated the troops’ and Occupy Wallstreet were ‘a bunch of pink-haired losers)… who then go on to say the Iraq War was stupid or and they’re enraged about Wallstreet Corruption and Nancy Pelosi. Arm chair warriors and shit-talkers… and most of them don’t have the courage to march for their own rights when push comes to shove.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The entire reason these guys were invited was to generate positive press and perception for Saudi Arabia to normalize them in the global eye. If it’s a decent enough country that they get the same western entertainment, have the fast food joints Bill Burr mentioned, and are such a cool place to visit like they’re all saying, they must not be doing anything that bad, right?

They say they’re allowed to be critical and yet, even back in the States they’re all just running tourism ads for Saudi. Comedy was just the delivery mechanism. They were paid for PR and they’re being good little workers. 

No mention of performing in venues slave laborers died to build. No acknowledgment from the crowd most focused on free speech about government-approved topics they could discuss (It’s in the fucking contract. Imagine if the U.S. pulled that shit). Just a bunch of turning a blind eye and whataboutism with “The U.S. does bad stuff too”. They are 100% delivering on their obligation to whitewash a country that is known globally as being worse than *bad* countries for a reason.</div>

On BBC Question Time, political commentator Ash Sarkar and columnist &amp; author Matthew Syed discuss the audience question: “Will Artificial Intelligence harm our ability to think?”

It just goes to show how hostile the atmosphere is towards AI right now.

It used to be that if the president (or a leader of a country) over stepped his bounds, a coup could possibly take place, staged by the military, to restore order, just like what happened in Madagascar.

Not saying each one of them works perfectly or that this isn't cool, but it helps no one to blatantly lie. If you want NES emulator source code just clone one of those. The end result is the same, you have a NES Emulator that you didn't actually write.

And before I get labeled a AI hater I actually use them daily for code completion and coded my Portfolio Website with it, but even for a product that you think is awesome you should stay realistic an gauge if you really gained anything or if you just "git clone"d sth with extra steps.</div>

I live near a lake and a river and used to find all kinds of secluded places with great views and would zone out for hours. This was pre-being-attached-to-your-cell-phone-every-second time. It felt like I stepped out of real life and away from responsibilities and was amazing. Highly recommend!

Now, they’ve built up condos everywhere and I’m too old to sneak onto private property to find seclusion. I can’t get that same dissociated affect with other people around, even at a distance.</div>

Reverse image searching shows this image was first posted to [ifunny ](https://ifunny.co/picture/the-extreme-right-has-a-new-hobby-and-it-s-Jiaeag457) on October 3rd 2019.

It's a modified article on a real news website. 

The title, the picture, the author's name, and the author's @ were all modified. 

The article on the right is a real article from [Vox.com](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/3/20677645/antifa-portland-andy-ngo-proud-boys) published on July 3rd 2019, same date as the fake article's publishing date.

So we know it was originally an article on Vox.

Since the dates match up, we can assume the time at which the article was published was also unchanged.

If we search for a Vox article posted on July 3rd, 2019, at 2:30pm EDT, we can find [the original article used to make the satire headline](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/3/20678855/trump-july-4-event-salute-to-america-how-to-watch-explained).</div>

I don't wear my suit all the time, should I get rid of it? Or my wife's summer dresses in winter? Or my sweaters in summer?


If you feel you have too much clothing go through your closet and downsize. If you feel you wear the same clothes too much, pick something different. 


Simple is better, you don't need an over cooked hanger system to tell you what you wear or don't, what to keep and what to not. 


Not to mention the aggravation of trying to pull hangers out when hanging cleaned laundry. That one's a pull, nope, that one's a push. Or wait... Is that a pull too? Oh damn, those ones have crossed and are opposite ways and have locked themselves together like some Chinese torture apparatus. Damn... </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I personally think you’re overthinking the concept. 

Obviously clothes that aren’t in season or are for special occasions where you won’t wear them for a while aren’t going to be something you’ll get rid of just because you didn’t wear them that month.

And I agree that going through your wardrobe and downsizing is a good option; but only for some people. I personally have the issue of looking at clothes I haven’t worn in months and saying that I’ll eventually wear them and I never end up donating them. So this has been a much better system for me to realize just how much I don’t wear those shirts, pants, hoodies, anything.

You can also just start hanging your clothes backwards and it has the same effect, I just find it hard to change a habit like how you hang your clothes so I personally would rather just take all my clothes out and flip them. 

And your last point just doesn’t make any sense at all. This LPT doesn’t require taking hangers out of a single piece of clothing. You simply just flip your piece of clothing 180° if your closet allows for it, and when they’re put back after wearing/washing you simply put them the way you typically do.

Overcooked. If flipping your hangars around once and then never putting them that orientation again is overcooked then I’m crazy. 

I’m very sorry that this LPT seemingly upset you so much</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">AGI timelines difference are often all about the definition.

For Karpathy it seems to include advanced robotics that can do physical trade jobs and even solving alignment. Well 10 years is optimistic with such a definition lol

Meanwhile people with shorter timelines have far less restrictive definitions. There is no "right" or "wrong" definitions but that's why i think it's more useful to put a timeline on specific capability.

Then when you say "Robot plumbers are a decade away", people will probably agree with you.

And then when you say "an AI that can answer the majority of prompts better than the majority of humans" well that's already there.</div>

until then the hardware will continue to improve and production cost will continue to drop - i'd say 10y is very pessimistic in that regard as Humanoid still haven't seen their investment hype moment

imho people shouldn't expect anything else than R&amp;D until 2028 and then we will see massive production ramp up worldwide, faster than any other manufactured good we ever seen</div>

I did ask Joe's team, as noted in my last video about Joe (Joe Rogan's Cult of Fake Archaeology). Mostly I feel as if Joe has wronged me with his 180 from learning from me, repeating my arguments over several months, to flipping and just crapping on me.

The fact he will crap on me behind my back and not let me explain archaeology and the evidence to his face, that shows who he really is. He clearly is biased and sticking up for ...</div>

He is trapped in an absolute echo chamber of Yes Men and walled off from any kind of true critical thinking engaged conversations that would challenge his worldview.

It has really become kind of a bummer to see a guy I used to respect for his open-mindedness become so close-minded and so cowardly as to attack people behind their back and not give them a chance to defend themselves.

Keep doing what you're doing Flint and don't be discouraged by people like Joe. He doesn't want to actually engage in real conversation anymore. Just focus on doing what you're doing and ignore the haters. They have nothing to contribute and will just drag you down with their attacks. Addressing them just fuels the fire and is exactly what they want. You're not dealing with people who are acting in good faith and actually want to know the truth.</div>

It happens to most of us and the ones that don't go down that road, most of the time just haven't had the opportunity to do so.

But the point in Joe's life that it happened is the surprising part but mid 40s I think most people are pretty fixed as a person that by mid 50s they won't have become someone radically different from the mid 40s version.

I've never seen Demis say something like that in public before.
