If you find a baby bird on the ground the first thing to do is check for injuries. Baby birds can look pretty weak, but if you don't see any blood or obvious damage then it's fine.

Other -

I give talks to social media companies on using their platforms for science communication. Sometimes I get paid, sometimes I don't. 

I give talks at comic cons about the science and biology of super heroes and their plant and animal analogs. Think what is a "spidey sense" to a spider?

I have a podcast, Bugs Need Heroes, which I received a grant that covered its cost for a year. Science communication is very important to me. 

Currently an adjunct, hoping a full time position opens up now that I have my PhD. I finished last Friday! Woo!

Keeping ChatGPT still at front and center, agents and APIs at second. I already rely on o3 generated reports for low value items I purchase, a dedicated product would certainly help them bring in that affiliate revenue. 

Wonder how would Sam traverse this as majority of this revenue would be going to Microsoft.</div>

The future is wack. We are aimed at the wrong direction, because it sells... My dad recently moved to a nicer house and i was automating it, just knobs and buttons, and he got pissed that the light switch was not touch. I was the one that had to buy the appliances because was for him everything would be touch.

Touch fucing sucks. My smartphone needs to be touch not my fucking washing machine, my light switch...

Imagine 3 fucking AM and you have to aim your finger to turn on the light instead of just slapping the shit out of it. Im crazy or because it looks tech doesnt mean it is better. Somethings are just not meant to be.

One time me and one of my best friends, a CS major, tried to convice me that the future would be watches... and i was like, lol. This was 2016, and i told him glasses... theres no subsititute to the smartphone other than glasses... Idk if we could achieve that, probably, but would never be fucking smartwatches... its a fucking watch. Its already wrong having anything else that it currently had at the time.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Kamala Harris' nomination was the epitome of the deaf and blindness of the DNC to the current political landscape. They really didn't even try to come up with anyone else (every candidate since Obama is basically someone who is linked to his legacy, whether that's the VP \[Biden\] or the Sec of State \[Clinton\], and now Harris, who is weakly linked to the DNC's last "success". She in fact was linked to the then current failure of the Biden admin, and it didn't occur to the DNC that maybe that's not the best candidate to put forward. 

Instead they poured tons of money at the problem thinking that was going to somehow solve everything. 

The sad and scary thing is, they STILL haven't learned their lesson. It wouldn't surprise me if they put forward Kamala Harris again for the next cycle.</div>

Those with AI being strictly guarded by corporations or governments. And OpenAI *has* played a very important role in that development. They are a positive force, he is right to point that out.

However, taking all the credit is way too much. Both because they aren't the only ones who made it happen, and because they had no other way to secure funding, so it wasn't exactly out of the goodness of their hearts.</div>

It helps to do AI art. If you say "boy" it will give a random boy from 7-18, random hair, random eyes. If you say "7 year old boy, blonde hair, blue eyes, wearing a suit and tie, standing on a grassy lawn mid-summer" it will get very specific. But you have to make it that way.</div>

&gt;Speaking with ABC News after the announcement, Makary maintained the administration would meet its "bold goal" despite no immediate plans for new regulations to force the move.

&gt;"There's no need to have a regulation or a statute when companies are volunteering to do it," Makary said. "We are going to use every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done to the best of our abilities."

So no regulations to enforce the ban, just trusting the companies to do the right thing apparently.</div>

Or making prescriptions more affordable?  
Or giving people better access to whole, healthy foods?

We're gonna celebrate a non-binding agreement to maybe do something in about 20 months as if it's the single greatest achievement in American history.

Meanwhile the EPA is lifting restrictions on water, air and soil pollution - all of which will flow into those whole healthy foods I mentioned, as well as our drinking water and the air we breathe.

But I'm sure all of that will be counteracted the slight change to the formula of Skittles (which will still have an absurd amount of sugar and other products).</div>

                <div class="post-content">I stumbled into a realization that hit me like a quiet thunderbolt: I'm always waiting for the next moment to feel finally "good", and it's been sneaking into every corner of my life - even when meditating.

I was sitting meditating, doing my usual thing, when it hit me. My mind was subtly leaning forward, like I was waiting for a bus that never arrives. Not in a loud way, but in this quiet, constant pull toward the next thing. I started noticing how I do this *all the time*. I tell myself, "I'l...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I feel like a big part of the meditation community is like this: How much time should I meditate to get the best effects? How should I do it? If I'm doing it wrong, I'm wasting my time, so I have to always make sure I'm doing it right. This comes from the unstoppable thirst of the ego to keep itself alive and from the desire to "reach something". I feel so connected to your view because I struggled with this mindset for a long time, and I believe this is the trap that masters want you to realize—you have to tune your radio to a certain frequency and then stay there, however you do it, not forcing it until you somehow make it stubbornly. This is what I think a lot of people experience when practicing Anapana or other ancient techniques. Prepare for the downvotes of people that force concentration meditation thinking that should be the only correct path.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes, exactly. The 'real' presence isn’t something hidden - it’s already here. Thinking, worrying, even searching all happen within awareness. The issue is, people often try to avoid parts of the moment they don’t like, and that keeps them stuck in a loop, waiting for a better future to be happy. I was the same - always postponing my happiness, thinking it’d come later, but it never did. It’s all right here, I just had to stop avoiding it. 😊</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is a very nice insight. I wrote about something like that a couple weeks ago. My insight was not so much in the micro cosmos like yours but in the macro cosmos. Meaning that, I realized that my LIFE is happening now. With all its imperfections and messiness. I realized that I'm always chasing a goal in the future "if I just get to live there... Or if I just get to be free etc." made me not live my LIFE at all. I am always discontent with something and need to fix something. And so I realized, that it will be the same once I achieve whatever I think will give me peace, happiness or whatever. It's a trap, an illusion. 

This insight was profound. However, not to be a Debbie Downer, but the insight alone seems temporary. Old habits and patterns of thinking will reappear. It will take tremendous effort and constant attention. Like the saying goes, it's simple but it won't be easy.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’m glad my post resonated with you! You're spot on - old patterns definitely creep back in. Even after realizing this, it’s easy to slip back into the cycle of chasing. But the more we stay aware of it, the less power those patterns have. It's a process, but the key is to keep coming back to the present - not by effort, but by allowing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Part one:

I'm saying what I say here knowing that some may get it and others really probably won't, not until later. I think it's helpful. Some of it will help tho, I think that can work either way but I'll help more if anybody wants. 

The modern understanding of awareness is that attention is rapidly moving between things. There is always a knowing while you're conscious and there are various definitions you can read about knowing and knowingness, but that's not what I think is important. When people have experiences their reward system can already be thinking in a way that mutates the body's capacity to live off of what it's experiencing from intention. It seems like SUCH a delicate system but eventually it really isn't, one can work it down and see how their feelings can start to change a lot more than normal due to how they focused in that moment but they can have plenty of momentum to switch focus and let the feelings circulate without feeling disturbed. That point is an incredible accomplishment to feel in yourself because you can feel like emotions are easy, like playing an instrument or second nature, you can live more subconsciously.

So, there are many paths, I use witness consciousness which basically means I learn as the conscious observer of my thoughts and feelings and through realization I can achieve deeper states. Some people will skip that step and try to embody the experiences non-duality entails. They're both a little different but similar all the same, skipping witness consciousness when it suits you can be a drag, there can be consequences, like banging your head against the wall but not making progress, just going at it over and over without having a foundation to focus and having intention can work out less for people, ironically that's basically how it works. You can set an intention but already have so much in the subconscious to work out, you may find your way out but there is a direct approach that can be taken throughout the day and that's the key point I think, what someone does with their day not just their meditation. 

People use the term I AM, and I AM in terms of I GO are like peas in a pod, in a way you are always going, it can be a happening or it can be like you're trying to go somewhere, non-dual concepts divulge from there a lot. People end up habituating, either way this can happen, so people want to understand what can be done for them. 

Emotions can feel more like a background process as someone practices but in particular I would note this about negative emotions because they can truly start to feel different, like you get very minimally entangled with them and they just pass through you. When you're conscious of your thoughts and feelings you can have feelings that come up, you can feel like you're processing and integrating information and it is like still motion, not quite still not quite motion, like the silence of awareness. The two are intertwined during conscious experience, you can feel like you're observing something, it can be like having a big ol pair of eyeballs while other emotions go through your awareness and they're all like background processes in a way. You can push a feeling out and have it feel like moving a feeling with the back of your mind... Subjective experiences are really hard to describe but you can realize things like this eventually through practice. 

It can be like going to meditate but your subconscious can feel rewarded by processes that will actually knit with other processes in coherent ways. It can feel a ton like doing something, and this is one of those feelings that can help someone to see it more clearly, this way you can be involved with it but feel things click into place and create consistent positivity, even so far as to realize how when you do things just a little different, something different can happen. When you have feelings you can pick up on aspects of it and learn how to just understand an effective way to create another feeling to a very large degree, just like how feeling emotions can feel easy it can just feel like playing an instrument really well, you can feel connected to your body and take your mind off of some of it knowing how it feels to be aware and how it's like attention is rapidly moving between things. When things have more significance to u then they can feel different.

I use the word subdivision to describe how you can have multiple emotional processes and energy can be distributed to each one, you take what you have and through one means or another it gets put to different processes. Someone who doesn't understand how to work with this will not be able to use adrenaline to create feelings and see just how much they can knit together and the senses they have can feel random because they did not yet learn how to concentrate, over time, personally discover what subjective experiences they have. Trying to have some feelings may even feel silly, but ime if there is more energy and more proficiency, you can continue to find how your emotions really can sorta mathematically work together, it's just not something you completely create from scratch, when we're conscious of the feelings by natural progression our energy cumulates into more energy, it's in motion, it's a constant motion for us. 

Even being a little hung up on this or that thought or not quite rewarded by the right things in the right way at the right time, of course it's hard to just enjoy a song and work with the feelings, it's hard to comprehend how you can keep going and just let negative feelings influence the experience. You can start to see it so that you're still living off of that fuel while you're conscious and conscious of your thoughts and feelings, meaning u understand or you observe them, both are applicable. U know them, but how deeply do you know them?

Of COURSE your mind is looking to each next thing, that's simply how it feels to process and integrate information, but FOCUS can change, you have this feedback loop when being conscious, it is possible to have nirvikalpa samadhi and it is called "formless" but those emotions and thoughts are still very much something which is known, however they are at that point. There are spectrums you learn to work with, but you can function incredibly well with coherence and some wisdom, whether you're pushing towards or *for* something. People have subconscious minds that are just programmed in this way, like for one person they feel a big reward from realizing something rather than having a realization while understanding in a way that lends a ton of reward already. The spectrums are like pressure, the brain and emotions are like a pressure system, you can know how they work together based off how you feel really well but I can take two or three years to really really get up there with it when someone is learning well. 

Rather than having attention switching between these sentimental rewards from introspection, you have awareness helping you absorb information while performing in a way that knits it together very adaptive-like or it results in a comfortable unfolding of emotions.</div>

Emotions are like a soup, when you walk around you have your subdivisions whether u see it clearly or not and they work in tandem. All sorts of things influence this, but people will familiarize with the feeling of energy being in the head such that it can help someone continuously feel balanced. Energy can still be doing things, walking can cause emotions, the soup continues, you continue to have subdivisions that work together and in deep states they can merge deeply, either way can work fantastically, samadhi can be hard to see.

So the soup is actually good to be able to appreciate, of course you feel like you're squeezing emotions out and expressing emotions! You still have attention on a spot and awareness with a reward system. Eventually it feels like super-expansion, like playing an instrument.</div>

I let AI do everything, read all files, find the context of the projects, make all the edits based on my inputs and requirements. I realized I hate to touch the code myself now.

I have it write code in a language I don't know, then if I miss something, ask it to explain it in terms of one I do. I started doing this about 10 days ago and now I can read Dart code without help pretty easily.</div>

So I tried cline, but was not very impressed with its performance. It actually was similar to my first versions of my solution under the hood. But I dont use vs code and my solution was ide agnostic.

Then I tried windsurf and that sucked really hard. It couldn't solve complex tasks I am able with mine.

So, I am improving my tool and are happy with it 😅</div>

Most likely assumption everyone had is later that night thief is gonna come back for it when nobody is around.  Since the lock is glued shut it can't be easily removed, so the thiefs hope is the owner just leaves it there to come back later to solve the issue. 

Now i do not own a bike myself but I was wondering how you'd prove it was yours, cause my immediate thought it that "sucks, just cut the lock off go on ...</div>

Most bikes have a serial number stamped somewhere on the frame that can be used to identify ownership. There is even a non-profit, Bike Index, that has a database of bike owners.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">this is the real answer.  take pictures of the bike and it's serial number and register it at a database as yours. this can help prove ownership and with recovery if it is stolen.

I graduated only a few years ago and we were one of the top high schools in my state and still used 15-20 year old textbooks with instructors who barely understood the content after teaching for years. The department of education was a joke. I have no idea where the money went, but there is no way most of it went to the schools. AI is the future of education and will make the world much smarter than it has ever been before.</div>
