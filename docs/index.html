It did that glazing because it was instructed to, and as people showed, it was willing to reduce quality of output to keep glazing the user when the user seemed to pref delusional output. </div>

Regardless, and moreover, your description of it reads very intuitive, but a bit simple relative to the situation.

https://openai.com/index/expanding-on-sycophancy/

Leaving that here because the sycophancy problem is, shockingly, much more interesting than most internet memes reduced it to be. Anyone truly interested in the nature of this technology oughtta be following a bit more closely on it than meme level. Not saying you're necessarily doing that here, but enough people are that I figure a callout is worth shoehorning in here.</div>

If the rumors of the failed training run are true, according to those rumors, OpenAI purposely pivoted to the GPT4o and o1-o4 series as a result of the failure. So they could be referring to that as well. Or not… Who knows honestly.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm worried about coupling the "AI coding agent" with the "AI model".

Atm we have 2 healthy ecosystem categories:

1. AI coding agents. Cline, Roo, Aider, Kilo Code (disclaimer: I'm a maintainer for Kilo Code), you name it. They all have TONS of WEEKLY releases (better integration, workflows, etc.) 90+% of them (at least the popular ones) are 100% free and open source. 

2. AI models. We see 2-3 of those every single week. They're getting cheaper and better.

These 2 categories work in a nice way where we get more features, faster, for cheap/free (local models are also getting more popular nowadays).

Acquisitions like these heavily bias this dynamic. I can't help but think that Windsurf will start favoring OpenAI models over others (like Gemini/Claude) which could inevitably lead to its downfall.

Time will tell.</div>

I don't mind paying for what works. If you're a paid tool and you allow more models into that otherwise closed ecosystem then they should be equally as good at the job or or just don't bring them online.</div>

This is a very good time to sneak in with the OpenAI name which is just as strong as GitHub right now and capture the lions share of the enterprise market by being significantly better than Copilot is right now. 

Not to mention that as the model provider, it’s in their best interest to maximize caching capabilities and server-side codebase indexing along with heavily subsidizing API costs as “marketing spend” in early years while building market share that will pay itself off when prices inevitably decrease.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I work in the recall space and saw this one go through. Basically FMVSS has a requirement that determines how many seatbelts you need based on how big the seating surface is. The ID.BUZZ third row is big enough to seat 3 but they only intended for 2 and are technically short a seat belt. The remedy is to add trim panels to remove some seating area.

But the feds have "designated seating positions" based on how much room is available on the seat--330 mm/13" of hip room. Other countries have even smaller thresholds, which is how Honda was able to get away with that infamous 10-passenger CR-V in the Philippines.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I suspect you underestimate how shifty manufacturers, importers, and customizers can be. It's not a nitpick. It's deliberate. If it was cheaper to import something and say "this is not a 10 seat van it's a two seat sportscar with padded storage benches so I don't need to crash test or provide Latch fittings at those other 8 locations" then companies would do it.

I've no idea how marginal the VW seat is, but I'd bet the rule exists for a reason.

There are vehicles that have been imported with disposable seats to be a passenger vehicle not a truck and vehicles imported with disposable window filler panels to be a cargo van not a passenger vehicle.</div>

A seat with 13" of width is determined to be that line. A hatch of the 350z is not that, so if you do hurt yourself, Nissan isn't liable.</div>

Not sure when it happened exactly, but I’ve basically stopped Googling error messages, syntax questions, or random “how do I…” issues. I just ask AI and move on.
It’s faster, sure but it also makes me wonder how much I’m missing by not browsing Stack Overflow threads or reading docs as much.

If you can tell it exactly how to do something, it will usually do it well. But if it requires special framework knowledge, or some level of architecture design, it will likely flail and require you to reorganize the code manually, or write it yourself to save yourself the pain of a super detailed request over and over again.</div>

Hell, look at METR's recent work -- the time of tasks (mostly software engineering) that AI can complete is doubling every seven months. It's doubling every four months if you just look at the last couple months of AI models. There's *zero* evidence these trends are even slowing down -- benchmarks are saturating faster and faster no matter what they are.

People in other subreddits are too busy squabbling over if it can count the R's in strawberry. People I know in real life barely even know what ChatGPT is beyond "oh that silly chat bot?" It won't be real to them until it comes from their boss in the form of a lay-off notice. This is so bizarre to me???</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; It's wild to me that so many data points are strongly indicating this to really be our near-term reality, but people genuinely have no idea.

It's not that they don't have "no idea" but are actively denying it. And I just don't get it.

Whatever your coding forte is... backend or frontend, React or Angular, Python or .NET... doesn't matter. It is time to leave that behind and start thinking about improving your architecture skills and soft skills.

Solution and system design, talking to clients and translating "client-speak" into English and a viable real project, managing your own team (which will consist of a team of agents) will be the future.

Don't be the modern equivalent of the 60-year-old boomer coder who is refusing to do anything cloud related because he still thinks that "cloud is just a fad bro" then gets fired and will never find a new job ever again. The programming subs of Reddit are surprisingly full of those, just AI instead of cloud. It'll be a bloodbath 1-2 years down the road.

But it will not be the fault of AI but your laziness and your "I know it better than actual scientists and experts". I work daily with AI researchers, and I have told people for five years now how to prepare, but even now, basically on the edge of a new digital era, people still find excuses and stupid reasons to do absolutely nothing. Which I don't understand and blows my mind.

Look, even if I'm completely wrong, the worst thing that happens is that you learned some new skills every modern dev should have anyway, oh no. And now think about the worst thing that can happen if you are wrong, and nobody needs people who can only write code anymore.

Sounds like a pretty fucking easy decision, and I can only explain it with some kind of underlying issues of ego and self-confidence if that's still not enough to convince you to save your fucking ass.</div>

For example, add a chart to show expanses in AI field to the chart that shows this progress in task times. And you'll see that they will correlate, as investments are growing exponentially too. The problem is, we cannot double investments every 7 months, cause we will run out of money and resources.</div>

I am being naive, but I believe many in society feel like when things get to the tipping point, they will be bailed out, because how can the world function with 99.9% unemployment.

If AI takes jobs fast enough that there's a critical mass of unemployable people (not unemployed! If you wholesale lose your job to AI, chances are those skills you've spent decades accruing are close to worthless. This moves too fast to expect enough people to reskill) at a given time, I can absolutely see that being sufficient impetus to enact things like UBI or negative income tax.

                                <div class="reply-body">it's so crazy to me that Google can't recreate Cursor... not even close. great, they have Firebase for webdev stuff... why limit it? why not just make it general purpose like cursor? it's wild. I feel like I could vibe code a Cursor clone, using Cursor, and have it come out better than any of the competitors currently have.

like, why can't any of these tools just read the terminal and automatically iterate on an error? why do I have to copy-paste the error and have it fix it? why not just have it run a check itself and look for faults? makes no sense. 

it seems like there is a ton of low hanging fruit that nobody is picking.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Gotta say it’s more than that. Yes they get an IDE on the quick, but just as much or even more value is the data feedback loop coming from the IDE’s users. This can give insight around where the ai succeeds, where it fails, and user responses are now training data. Other advantages is it gives OpenAI an entry point into a users workflow where it can start providing direct value that only open ai can provide. The advent of ides like cursor and windsurf was starting a path that could potentially commoditize ai behind someone else’s user interface. This gives open ai ownership of another set of customers and actually a place to hook in their $10k ai engineers. I suspect this will pay off.</div>
