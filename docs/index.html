                        <div class="comment-body">Asked ChatGPT to analyze it for interesting patterns/trends:

* **“For time” rules the mainsite—again.** \~46% of days in 2005 → \~53% in 2010 → **60.6% in 2024** → **55.4% in 2025** (so far).
* **Heavy days peaked in the mid-2000s—and then faded.** Heavy days were \~19–24% of posts around 2005–2009; they’re **6.6% in 2024** and **7.1% in 2025**. Expect debate.
* **EMOMs are still niche.** \~0–1% most years; **\~2.9% in 2025** (an uptick, but still tiny).
* **AMRAP steadily grew.** \~9% (2005) → \~13–15% (mid-2010s) → **\~14–18%** the last few years.
* **Complexity just jumped.** Median distinct movements/WOD sat at **2** for \~20 years, nudged to **3 in 2024** and **5 in 2025**. Programming has gotten “busier.”
* **Triplets are back.** Triplet **MGW** days were \~10–13% for much of the 2010s; **2025 is \~35%**.
* **“21-15-9” is rare.** Across eras: **2.27% (’01–’09)**, **2.82% (’10–’16)**, **2.65% (’17–’25)**. In **2025: 2.8%**. Iconic ≠ common.
* **The Girls had a golden age, then cooled.** Girl benchmarks were **\~15–16%** of days in 2006–2007; **8.4% in 2024**, **7.4% in 2025**.
* **New-school implements really arrived.**
   * **Wall walks** show up from **2018** and stick post-2021.
   * **Echo Bike** first appears **2021** and is on **\~25% of 2025** days so far.
   * **DB snatch** isn’t just an Open relic—first seen **2003**; **\~6.7% in 2025**.
* **Most-programmed movements ever = pull-ups &amp; cardio.** % of all non-rest days: **pull-up 24.8%**, **run 20.7%**, **deadlift 14.7%**, **row 14.3%**, **shoulder press 12.7%**, **clean 12.5%**, **sit-up 11.7%**, **jerk 8.5%**, **snatch 8.0%**, **thruster 7.6%**.
* **Rest discipline stayed classic.** Rest sits near **25%** overall (3-on/1-off). It drifted **up** recently: **28.1% (2024)** → **28.7% (2025)**.
* **When’s rest, really?** **Sunday and Thursday** are statistically most likely to be rest days across the archive.
* **Murph season is real—and growing.** Multiple mentions around Memorial Day; **4 posts in 2024** and **4 in 2025** referenced “Murph.”</div>

Is even loading roms.

I thought AI will be able to write NES emulator not faster than 2026 or 2027 .. that is crazy.

One second search shows multiple repos:

[https://github.com/idircarlos/NES](https://github.com/idircarlos/NES) (Literally description is "**NES Emulator written in pure C**")

[https://github.com/ObaraEmmanuel/NES](https://github.com/ObaraEmmanuel/NES)

Still impressive for a LLM to achieve this of course.

If you ask it to create a simple nes game designer in pure c that will generate nes file that we can run with these emulators, then that would be an interesting case (since I'm not aware of such repo)

Edit: LOL getting downvoted because I'm explaining what overfitting is why it's not groundbreaking. You don't have to be ML Engineer to understand overfitting rule is not as impressive as you think it is and why ML field don't like that.</div>

Instead, phrase it around market alignment and value. For example:

* “Based on market data, this role averages \\$X–\\$Y, and I’d like to align closer to that range.”
* “Over the past year I’ve taken on A, B, and C responsibilities, which are typically part of higher-level roles.”

It's a lot to think about. Is there a point where chasing "market value" just becomes another kind of trap?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If you have data, do not share it. You do not want to turn a compensation and value add conversation into a "my data is better than yours" debate. If you share data, your company can argue your data is wrong / doesn't apply / whatever. 


Instead, it's simply a claim you make backed by the scope of your role and value you add. Make it a range from low (your target) to high (just for show) to give your counterpart a feeling of being a great negotiator by bringing you down to the low end (which was your goal from the start).


The key though is walk away point: If you can walk (outside offer, you don't care about the job, fire, etc), you can negotiate hard as you have good alternatives. If you cannot walk (no alternative to this job), you can ask but you have no real leverage.


In the end, compensation is not a mathematical problem where inputs lead to the right outputs. Instead it's an obscure gauging of market dynamics (supply demand for your role in your location) and leverage.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is why asking for a raise nowadays is scary. It automatically labels you as a flight risk exactly like you said which a lot of the time can make you a target to get laid off if you stay. Companies have made it so that it really is no safe way to ask for a raise if you need/deserve one. 

Ask for one: they'll think you're unhappy and planning on leaving if told no. 

Presenting a competing offer letter with a higher salary: They'll again assume you're looking to leave and probably fire you after giving you the raise. 

Even if you only got a competing offer to have some leverage, they won't care and will dispose of you when it's convenient for them. 

Maybe I'm just cynical but it really doesn't seem like you can win anymore. Hence, why people just leave for another job when they want more money. Even if they like their company/boss.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Being seen as a flight risk is another way to say "key employee who needs to be retained." 

If you're easily replaceable than the risk to the company if you "fly away" is very low. 

Replacing any employee takes training and causes downtime, so everyone has a *little bit* of leverage. But if that's all you've got, this advice isn't for you anyway.</div>

• The suspect, identified as Tyler Robinson, reached out to a family friend, who then contacted authorities, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said. Robinson spoke negatively of Kirk before the shooting, a family member told investigators, the governor said.

• President Donald Trump earlier said he believed “with a high degree of certainty” that the shooting suspect had been apprehended.

Hunter-gatherers worked around 4 hours a day in a much peaceful and natural environment. They also did not starve all the time because they were experts on one thing: Getting food.


The social climate was completely different too. Much more relaxed and loving where you were surrounded by people you knew everyday. Many anthropologist who studied them, often fell in love and expressed how loved they felt etc.


People are just burnt-out and are barely trying to stay a float and that makes many ppl mean.


Modern society may look pretty, but if you truly examine it, it is a sick one in many ways.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">As a registered therapist (not presently licensed - this is a whole other subtopic) take what you will from this. But I don’t think therapy is the be all end all, holy grail of healing and growth. It is a marker of status however.

In fact, I don’t think it’s all we’ve chucked it up to be. Because it’s still a humans with humans. And our education is built by certain cultural standards and norms that many of us are drowning under. It’s still of a system that works for some but not for many. There are things baked into this idea (like this assumption that it’s the answer) that need to be (and are in some ways) dispelled.

What I think most people need and benefit from when it comes to using the AI, is organizing a lot of nuanced experiences into a coherent narrative, with not only space (and time, take your time) to be validated for experiencing complex emotions, power dynamics and constraints, but to still be able to ask an exhaustive amount of questions - until you feel - complete (with your process). 

Not only can you typically not do that with another human, you can’t even do that with a therapist (times up!)

It’s a tool, don’t forget that. Remember to tell it not to kiss your ass. And remember to still make the effort to communicate with humans. 

But it is a tool and it is what we make of it, so use it if you need to. 

Just be careful, in the words of the artist, formerly known as Prince: “it’s OK to get on the Internet, just don’t let the Internet get on you.”</div>

It's similar to RWKV models, as they also convert models to something akin to linear attention. They don't show that those models maintain quality at those long context, which is usually what breaks down with those conversions.</div>

I mean fuck, someone has to because he's up there on his holy ass munching popcorn watching the mess down here and not doing a him-damned thing to help. So since we're on our own anyhow, we have to help ourselves and one another out any way we can because no one else is going to do it for us.</div>

we're going to eventually get to a point where we are trying to make better humans with immunity to all disease or virus, no more handicap, with a high IQ, etc. that these imbeciles will still say that they'd prefer have their childrens to be born with less chromosomes than to use this technology because it's "pretending to be god" or someshit, or it's haram or bla blah blah

like it's clearly not thanks to their mentality that we eradicated disease that killed millions of people, those who thought above these cults who crave knowledge gave us science not these mentality limited and primitive view of life, in fact their cults prevented all of this technology and knowledge to be discovered earlier and yet they want from us to let people have miserable life by being mentally challenged, handicapped or by being uglier than quasimodo ? good thing humanity will eradicate these cults in the future that have existed for millenia's, given enough time of course</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Are they talking about in vitro gametogenesis, or an alternate path?

Either way, the point for them is clear. More than 10% of their people are already born from IVF, and the biggest roadblock in IVF is embryo creation. Their birth rate is low too. Boost the success, lower the health burden, and decrease the cost of embryos, and they will see an uptick in births. Not to replacement or anything crazy like that, but maybe a solid 0.1 improvement in TFR. This is one of the best national investments they can make.

Of course, improving embryo creation also enables substantial embryo selection. Probably not their goal, but it'll happen regardless.</div>

I guess you could measure it in total tokens? But that's going to be more difficult to interpret, especially with summarization steps and the like.

Two of the engravings on the alleged unspent bullet casings yesterday make two anti gay/anti trans slurs(one a 4chan meme) The Catholic trans shooter had occult symbols,  nazi memes, pro trans, death, and even leftist memes...very confusing. It's all some bizarre mix of nihilism that mixes a grab bag of telegram nihilism, groyper gamer, far right/ left anarchism and a death worship fascination.

I don't think that thats possible. During the early times of expert systems (early 1980s) we thought that we are a breakthrough away from a conversational AI and we even had some proto versions of them...

They were right we were not that far from the next step. Only issue is said seminal paper came in 2017 and not within a decade as they expected.

The pace of progress may be predictable when you zoom out, but I don't think it is so when you zoom in. Next breakthrough may come within Demis' lifetime, it may not. Minsky never lived to see conversational AIs of widespread use (he just missed them).

We don't know when the next breakthrough will be. It may be in 5 to 10 years. It may be in 40. I don't think anyone knows.</div>

The whole "PhD level AI" description is similarly flawed - if not deliberately misleading; it is presented as universal, while it only applies to specific topics in specific context.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I would say Demis' statement is self-evident, anyone understands that LLMs can't do everything at the level of a human with a PhD. That would be AGI, and nobody (sane) claims they've cracked AGI.

The claim of "PhD level intelligence" should be argued in the context that it was made, a non-AGI agent analyzing a corpus of documents in a domain it was trained for and arriving at true and actionable conclusions, and then comparing the veracity and quality of those conclusions with those of humans trained at various levels, up to and including a PhD in that subject area. This is a much narrower and well defined problem, and it stand to reason humans will struggle in this race, giving some substance to the "PhD level" claims.

Let's make a mental experiment: let's say a powerful LLM analyzes all the literature in molecular biology, uses chain of though reasoning to conclude that a certain class of compounds could have strong anti-cancer effects, synthesizes that compound using its attached chemical lab and we find it completely cures cancer in a bunch of rats. Let's say the LLMs is not very smart and can't do this on the first try, but can try it a million times during the next 6 months, synthesizes 10000 candidate molecules, finds that 10 of those have strong results in vitro, and finally confirms 1 of them as a rat cancer cure.

Does it matter if each one of those 1 million invocations was not "really" at PhD level intelligence, that some hallucinated or misunderstood basic science, fudged the numbers etc. ? Would you trow the successful compound in the sink, since it was clearly produced by a moron? Would you refuse to take the new drug after it was clinically confirmed, and die of cancer, along with your ideas about what intelligence "really" is?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think validating proofs is an extremely tedious and time consuming process.

For a lot of frontier mathematics there aren't that many domain experts who can follow the work or verify it.

Fermat's Last Theorem had a number of proofs that turned out to contain flaws, and even Andrew Wiles's initial proof had an error so he had to correct it. After announcing the proof in 1993 it took 2 years for it to be reviewed and be published.

With formalization, mathematicians can probably have a high degree of confidence that the proof itself it actually valid. 

If AI tools came along that allowed mathematicians to formalize their proofs, it would make the field a lot more agile, as people would know right away if the work is actually true or not.</div>

When I opened it, I saw people I’ve known for many years sharing their “best life” the same way I used to post before. I used to love Instagram, spending hours scrolling, posting everything that happened in my life, and even getting messages from people telling me I was living the best life.

I just got tired of seeing all the people I know trying to one up each other. It is sad as it encourages people to go further and further into debt, purely so they can try to be the "best".

I think the saying "envy is the thief of joy" is very true when it comes to social media.

So I pulled the plug on facebook and never went back.

My life has changed significantly since then, but I have no intention of advertising the fact.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I have deleted my instagram too, I use it every once in a while just to do some shopping from some boutiques but using Instagram really affects my mood and seeing those “best life” things triggers me. 

And it’s not just pictures, posts, triggers by the people you know, Instagram injects you with topics you weren’t even thinking about. For example, I saw a reel when I last logged in and it was an Indian guy talking about how he faced racism in some country. And it makes me feel sad, but what made me sadder is how people in the comment section were saying Indians deserve to be mistreated anyway, so don’t be a crybaby. 

Now, before I saw the reel, I was perfectly okay, but seeing those posts and comments by those hateful people, it made me wonder what kind of a world we’re living in. I want to be a mom one day, but do I want to bring a child into a world like this? I went into an emotional spiral for hours!!! 

Why? Because people on IG (most of whom are not exactly Intellectuals and Academics) are spreading their baseless, biased and stereotypical views and opinions and how!!! 

The thing is, I’ve seen that hate related content is more prevalent and it gets clicks, so people create and comment on such videos. They’re earning their money, but an average person like me, who is using Instagram; they’ll feel unsettled by it and start questioning the world. 

Hence, I have decided not to use IG. I use it for shopping sometimes, but uninstall the App once I am done. 

Mental Peace &gt; Everything else!</div>
