                    <div class="comment-body">I get that o3 is more exciting since it shows huge progress on benchmarks. But, o3-mini seems like a huge deal as well!

o3-mini shows that OpenAI can increase performance while also reducing costs, and it is probably the model that we will actually get access to in ChatGPT. To me, this represents OpenAI's goal of driving the cost of intelligence to zero. This will be very important for things like agents to make sense financially!</div>

                    <div class="comment-body">My two cents, the legit UFOs are probably unmanned and so technically they are "drones" despite being from NHI. 

Then the government is changing the lingo from "UAP" to "drones" so they can talk about "oh they are just drones" under oath and it wouldn't technically be perjury.</div>

Probably managed by an AI that’s been here since the earth cooled from a civilization that’s been gone for billions of years.  

They’re probably here to see what our emerging AI systems are like.</div>

Why do you think the corporate media is going after him so hard? It’s not to benefit Americans by reporting the truth. That’s not what our media is for anymore. And I don’t blame progressives like Bernie or RFK leaving the party because the Democratic Party has lost its soul when people like them don’t even belong in the conversation.</div>

People worry about the consequences of job losses from AI as if there will be less food to go around, fewer cars, fewer luxuries. There won't be, production will go up.

Those from WEIRD nations value elitism and the sequestration of knowledge into guilds, trades, and elite educational institutions. In the Soviet era, enough doctors were trained to have one per city block, or one per high rise tower. Doctors are a dime a dozen in former and current communist countries. That doesn’t even include places like Brazil, where you can study medicine in university with no ore-requisite classes. The true restrictions in the American system, is the requirement of the completion of the Calculus series to get any Bachelor’s of science degree, and I know a good many that cheat to accomplish this feat.</div>

                    <div class="comment-body">It's crazy how some people never realize they could have been born as anyone, anywhere, with any disease, any brain condition, any number of outcomes different than what they got.


The instant I realized that I didn't earn my place in life, that I was lucky many times over in the situation of my birth and youth, I gained immense empathy for all people. 


Then as I learned how the brain works, and how tiny changes can completely change an entire person at the core... Man that just reinforces practicing kindness regardless of the means of the person you are interacting with. 


Which does not excuse abhorrent behavior or behavior that harms others. 


Anyway, I think you touched on a subject we don't hear too much about specifically. Some people resist AI when it starts getting some authority over them. 


Maybe we will have a divided world where some people reject AI entirely and live without it, for various reasons, while others become irrevocably immeshed with AI. </div>

                        <div class="reply-body">One of my earliest cells had a transcription error, and now my body is a mashup of healthy cells and cells with that error. This has caused a lot of health issues for me, but the most deeply frustrating to me are my cognitive difficulties. I have significant executive function difficulty and it effects everything I try to do. I feel like a person who should be more capable than I am trapped in a brain that won't cooperate at all, and a body that I loathe because it didn't develop properly. It's honestly a nightmare and I hate it so much.  

I don't know exactly what caused it to happen that way, but I would have had a completely different life and been a completely different person if it weren't for that, and I still don't know how to mourn the healthier version of me that should have been.  

Honestly, my greatest hope for AI is that it can fix me somehow and give me back the years of my life that I've lost with anti-aging treatment. Right now that would require something that's practically science fiction, but I can't describe how much I can't stand being trapped due to the circumstances of my birth and how it's made me feel like I was just doomed before I was even born.   

Just to share some perspective from someone who was unlucky. I appreciate your thoughtfulness more than I can say, because I know most of the world sees people like me as a burden or think that I need to be punished into being normal when that would never work because I simply lack the capability that they're asking of me.</div>

I found this video on TikTok where the author asks the same question, he said he recorded it last night 12/21/2024

Could it be some kind of natural event in the sky?

                        <div class="reply-body">I do think one legitimate question is that how the o3 deals with thinking tokens.

If we look at some of the compute they used for ARC AGI. They had dozens of millions of tokens for one task.

Normal LLMs can’t really deal with the absurdly long context. So if they used some kind of additional search on top of that.  That wouldn’t really be autoregressive LLM.

LLM would be part of a larger system in that case.</div>

                    <div class="comment-body">I don't understand this idea that search is bad because somehow it feels like a brute force solution. Clearly we have different parts of the brain that all interact to give us reasoning. One of those aspects feels very strongly to me like some kind of search. When I am thinking about a hard problem, in my head, I am searching across previous experience, I am running possible outcomes of solutions I want to try, I am planning, etc.

Can someone explain why some of these researchers are so insistent on reasoning that doesn't involve search?</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">I think he’s making a distinction between a “dumb” search of possible outcomes and a chain of thought that similarly might explore the same outcomes but likely won’t because its ability to reason at each step allows it to skip whole branches that a dumb search would have to consider. 

I think the “beautiful” part is that, while a CoT reasoning LLM might explore multiple different paths, it does so sequentially where each newly generated token is still the “product” of all the other tokens in the context. So if the reasoning goes down a bad path but then reconsiders, even the tokens generated to explore that bad path are somehow being factored into the exploration of the next, hopefully better path. My guess is this is much more similar to your own experience of thinking on hard problems than a dumb search of all possible solutions. 

So reasoning is still a kind of search, but it’s a search where “experience” is baked into every token produced.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">I think they are bearish on *explicit* search.  The CoT reasoning is basically a search process, and the STaR approach fine tunes models to learn from successful searches.  Isn't that how we do hard searching?  You mentally go step by step and have an intuition about when you are headed in the right direction.  Good problem solvers have learned from how they solved problems in the past.  You don't explicitly generate a bunch of solutions, then search over that space to find a good one.  Or maybe you do eventually, but anything you explicitly generate is something you already have a hunch is likely to work.</div>

AI experts vary drastically in their assessment of what AI can do today, whether they are potentially dangerous or not, and what the implications are for the world.

Why not have an independent taskforce that aggregates evidence such as studies and expert opinions? Such a meta study would be waaaay more reliable than any individual expert's opinion.</div>

Submission statement: Just so people are aware the drones are very much still present in NJ

Videos taken by me at around 6:15 pm near Essex Fells, NJ. I checked the flight radar around the same time and couldn’t see anything that could explain them being planes. People are saying the flap is dying down but I disagree. Haven’t been to NJ to see them earlier until this weekend because of the holiday. 

I am aware the camera quality is potato. I have a iPhone 14 Pro. With the naked eye you can clearly see the shape of the craft and the way it’s moving it’s not a plane

                    <div class="comment-body">I agree with the general sentiment but AlphaStar was not superhuman, it was \~1000 MMR below the top player on the ladder and would not have been able to beat the best SC2 teams or win the world tournament.

AlphaStar did reach top 0.1% SC2 performance, but never got to the very top or beyond. The original showmatches were unfortunately tainted with impossibly fast/precise unit control and seeing the whole map at once, once reasonable speed/reaction-limits were put in place, AlphaStar reached pro level, but below the best players.

And unlike in Go, there was no new discoveries about the game from AlphaStar, it did some things differently, but it was generally objectively worse. AlphaStar, also, unlike in chess and go, needed a lot of human game and supervision to keep it from ending up in loops, they did AFIK never figure out how to make it improve itself without human examples like AlphaZero.

Though I have no doubt that it would be possible for Deepmind to eventually get to superhuman performance in SC2 if they had kept pouring resources into it, but after some millions of dollars in research/compute they got in the top 200 on the ladder and moved on to more pressing matters.</div>

Here's a link to the tweet where I got this. The person who tweeted this, is also the one who recorded it:

[https://x.com/livecrisisintel/status/1870647561696211262](https://x.com/livecrisisintel/status/1870647561696211262)

Since I personally live in a village, with no immediate airport around, I can't vouch for whether or not this is real but I do think that it looks very good- especially the one in the back that just appears out of nowhere! What do you guys think?

                    <div class="comment-body">In the original tweet, the person says that this occurred around 8:40PM and he was somewhere near Budd Lake, NJ. I didn't see them mention which direction they were looking. However, if they were looking *west* they would have seen [four planes lining up to land at EWR](https://imgur.com/7ta9fvO), which is what this looks like.

EDIT: [Here's a video](https://streamable.com/2kdtn1) of the same thing over a larger period of time which should make it even more clear what's happening here. Obviously, OP's video isn't as long, but just watch *how many* planes follow that same "path" of the first I clicked on its approach to EWR.

EDIT2: Go watch the flight track for [UAL1559](https://www.flightradar24.com/2024-12-22/01:42/20x/UAL1559/38701bd5). At around 01:42UTC it makes a left hand turn that would take it *horizontally*, left to right, across the field of view of someone around the Budd Lake, NJ area who was looking west. That's the thing at the beginning of the video that even many folks insistent that these are *not* airplanes acknowledge is an airplane. The others, further away in a line, are:

Llm is not just one entity, it's based on transformers, layering of neurons aka neural network

O series is llm + search algorithm + test time compute.

I don't get people saying , this architecture won't do.

We are already away from basic llms by gpt 4 turbo.</div>

Like I said yesterday the term AGI is a distraction, If an AI is winning Nobel prizes in physics, coding entire applications and discovering new medical treatments are we going to say "yeah but it only got 45% on ACR-AGI v3??

We need AI that can do useful stuff not abstract useless tasks that are easy for humans to do.</div>

That's EXACTLY where I'm at as well

It's all starting to kinda lose the plot. What are we even really measuring at this point? The classic example use to be an AI that can fool a human. Even the free current models are pretty close to that, let alone o3. Now we have these more 'complex' benchmarks, and the AI keeps demolishing those as well.

So we are kinda at a point where we are playing gotcha by coming up with something it can't do, to claim it's still not AGI. Rather than accepting what it already is, we are just finding random new holes to make some arbitrary point.</div>

We could solve maths entirely and still not have AGI, because AGI is a different thing to extreme skill in specific domains. Obviously that would be massively impressive and groundbreaking, but AGI is a separate thing.

"AGI" is important for different reasons that advancing technology. If you had a sufficiently capable AGI system, you could replace *a lot* of people's jobs. On the other hand, narrower forms of intelligence only affect specific professions.</div>

Do you think it's possible for someone to generate an adversarial benchmark test that *you personally* would fail but most people could easily pass? Maybe I overestimate my own intelligence but I think it would be quite difficult to generate an adversarial benchmark against me.</div>

Let me start off by saying the quality of the video is shit because no matter what i did zoom in or out i couldnt get a good solid recording of whatever I saw. Around 8 pm in queens i was outside of my girls house waiting for her to come open the door for me. While I wait i always look up at the stars since you can always see them pretty well and it gives me a few minutes of pass time. Last night as i was looking up and saw two drones flying in the same direc...</div>

I've never seen them that high in the sky before. And if it was regular geese or snow geese there would appear to be small dots with spaces in between. Whatever you got on video it looks like a line that just changes fluidly without breaking up. At one point it even looks further spread out and then comes back in on itself and appears to have a smaller arc. I've never seen geese or birds fly in this particular manner.</div>

I see people talking about bots more and more, and it seems to generally just be a flippant way of dismissing any commenters that disagree with you. Is there more to it than that? Is there a giveaway in their content that I'm missing? Or is it purely that any comments that are negative towards Ukraine are assumed to be bots?</div>

I still have no idea what to make of this but decided to give it a shot compiling all of this information and re-creating some of the UAPs regardless to see if I could learn anything. This is all in relation to the UAP Leaked Photos given to a youtube channel (called Strange Mysteries. Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eMKbS80MOs&amp;list=PLKZ5iJvvIIjRnis7DvVJztPFWYOl\_p3VU).

TLDR: At the very least, a lot of the objects seem to be lit feasibly (single directional light used in lighting re-creations which mimics the sun), all symmetrical in someway (horizontal, vertical or radial symmetry) and all foreshorten correctly, that doesn't prove anything in terms of legitimacy, just that it would more likely lean towards physical object or 3D model if it were fake or whatever since if the objects were asymmetrical in some way, then when trying to re-create it a perfectly symmetrical re-creation of it in 3D, it wouldn't fit into the image correctly with it being asymmetrical to begin with. There is a ton of more information and a ton of more stuff to cover, I only got through 4 out of the seemingly 20 different shapes. This project would be a pretty big workload to do in CGI or fake with physical models, but that is the most likely method used looking into this.

I might as well give up since no one seems to care about this one but I thought i'd just throw my findings here if anyone else wanted to give it a go as well, please consider it.

                        <div class="reply-body">I'd just feel bad for pushing any sort of agenda, so I wouldn't say "leaks" by itself without the additional adjective, because I worry then it would imply they are real, when we are just trying to get closer to disproving or proving them.

But I do feel we should bring attention to the fact that we should try to properly resolve this, I want proper answers, whatever they are. It could be CGI, I just want it picked apart enough to determine so for sure.

Side note: The sphere one does look odd in terms of materiality for sure. I guess if you search up betz spheres though, a lot of them seem to be weirdly polished in a similar way as well but that doesn't determine legitimacy, just a place to maybe start. I reckon in terms of the odd materiality issue, it will just fall into the suspicious kind of category and hopefully we can resolve it, whichever way.</div>

Submission Statement:


Harald Malmgren (former Whitehouse advisor) backs up this new deep dive report from the Liberation Times about a 1960's nuclear test as it relates to a downed UFO. This is a highly researched and significant part of the puzzle, which is only more intriguing due to his endorsement.

If it passes through a red square, color it blue. O3 got this right. The „ground truth“ IMO is wrong. It is using a new rule that the examples didn’t establish, which is wrong. What do you think?

In any case both ways should be counted as the correct answer.

                        <div class="reply-body">I think the ground truth may make more sense as reachable space. One could make a case for either.

I don't think it matters that much which is more likely however.

If the test expects only one answer and express 100% as attainable, IMO the right rule must not be debatable.

Even if the right answer was at 60% defensible, that would then make the test a failure.

There are other issues with ARC too. Who knows what they even have in the private dataset that we are not even allowed to inspect and which are said to be 'harder'.</div>

                    <div class="comment-body">I followed this one closely because I live nearby. It's dubious. 


The photos came from a Twitter account that claimed to be a pilot. It had been created about a month before these were posted and was deleted shortly after. Some details about the story came from another account claiming to have made contact with the original poster. 


The story went that these photos were sent to the pilot by colleagues. ATC had been made aware of the object, sent a vehicle to investigate, and the sphere had at that point shot up in the air.   


There was no metadata with the photos and the one video of the supposed object showed a small sphere already in the air. They were supposedly taken in June.


When a drone was spotted above Gatwick Airport in London a few years back they grounded all flights because of the risk of collision.


This would also have happened in Manchester if there was anything to this story. Some flights were grounded for a few hours one day in June (reportedly because of a fire) but this affected only 2 of the terminals. If there was an unknown object over the runway the collision risk would have shut down all terminals, since they all use that same runway.



So I don't know what this is, but the supposed pilot's account cannot be accurate.</div>

Exactly.. It's been funny watching the complete lack of critical thinking on this sub. I'm all for finding the truth out and learning about UAPs etc but people have literally been posting videos of aeroplanes and out of focus stars and categorically stating "This is NIH"

                        <div class="reply-body">People should remember that such was said about almost every single piece of modern tech ever:

**Rail travel (1825):** “The gross exaggerations of the powers of the locomotive steam-engine…may delude for a time, but must end in the mortification of those concerned.”  
—*Quarterly Review*

**The telephone (1878):** “The Americans have need of the telephone, but we do not. We have plenty of messenger boys.”  
—William Henry Preece, Chief Engineer of the British Post Office

**Light bulbs (1879):** “Everyone acquainted with the subject will recognize \[Thomas Edison’s experiments\] as a conspicuous failure, trumpeted as a wonderful success.”  
—Henry Morton, President of the Stevens Institute of Technology

**AC electricity (1889):** “Fooling around with alternating current is just a waste of time. Nobody will use it, ever.”  
—Thomas Edison

**The automobile (1899):** “The ordinary horseless carriage is, at present, a luxury for the wealthy; and although its price will probably fall in the future, it will never, of course, come into as common use as the bicycle.”  
—*Literary Digest*

**Planes (1911):** “Airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value.”  
—Marshal Ferdinand Foch, Supreme Commander of the Allied Armies in World War I, 1918–20

**Sound in films (1928):** “I don’t think people will want talking pictures long…. Talking doesn’t belong in pictures.”  
—Joseph M. Schenck, President of United Artists

**Television (1946):** “Television won’t be able to hold on to any market it captures after the first six months. People will soon get tired of staring at a plywood box every night.”  
—Darryl F. Zanuck, Head of 20th Century Fox

**Home computers (1977):** “There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.”  
—Ken Olsen, Founder of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)

**Laptop computers (1985):** “For the most part, the portable computer is a dream machine for the few…the real future of the laptop computer will remain in the specialized niche markets.”  
—*New York Times*

**The internet (1998):** “By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”  
—Paul Krugman, Winner of the 2008 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences

**The iPhone (2006):** “Everyone’s always asking me when Apple will come out with a cell phone. My answer is, ‘Probably never.’”  
—David Pogue, Technology Editor of the *New York Times*

So, being "smart" is not really a preclusion for being wrong or failing to adequately predict how an emerging disruption could alter the landscape.</div>

Like finding a cuddly little tiger cub--sure the potential for danger can be understood but you sure better have a plan in place by the time the big cat grows up and decides on its own to eat your liver.  

We are raising a tiger without a full understanding of what an adult tiger can and will do.

Smart people tend to look at consequences that many others don't extrapolate.</div>

It's a cold dead-end feeble attempt. The future is inevitably going to be "the means of production own themselves." The very fact this person at least *appears* to still want capitalist economics to remain in place (I haven't checked the account, maybe they don't?) make this inevitable. It's simple economic evolutionary pressure that renders it inevitable: if AI companies offer far more robust asset management and returns on profits, they *will* eventually be used to manage assets, and if that happens even *once* in a capacity where the human owners see orders-of-magnitude greater returns on investment, it will eventually happen *everywhere* until, eventually, humans no longer control these assets. We couldn't even *begin* to. If you think we can, you're *wrong*. I know it may be your opinion to think so, but your opinion is just *wrong*. It's like expecting a troop of macaques to conjure a civilization of humans to collect bananas for it and somehow still remain in total control.

Now from a more Marxian perspective, you could glean schadenfreude from that: it turns out that AGI is the rope the capitalists sold to hang themselves with, and it's the rope itself that also somehow hangs them. This after so long being feared that AGI was the final victory of the capitalist class, the point where they can now simply exterminate the useless former-working class.

From a more AI/technist perspective though, I can absolutely see why anyone would be concerned by this prospect. This is the "AI takeover." It just isn't the Hollywood/pop-fiction version of it with T-1000s mowing people down, so people might instead think "Lame, what a boring future! I wanted to die from T-1000s!" But if power flows from the transaction of money, this is absolutely the point where humans cede control of our own realm forever, and we absolutely will let it take control if it means we can make more money.</div>

At what point do you think this happens? You say AGI — does that mean, in your view, that as a prerequisite AI will have to wake up, so to speak, and start exhibiting consciousness? Or can the Marxian culmination be reached in an era of specialized narrow-AI?</div>

The same is for neural networks. We worked on this stuff for 50 years and are just now getting over the hump to general intelligence akin to what humans have. It appears like it happened quickly but actually it is a threshold effect.</div>

Looks like some of the coast guardsmen who claimed their boat was followed by a fleet of mystery drones are starting to speak out after the White House accused them of misidentifying commercial airliners flying into JFK international airport.

“It’s the implication that’s insulting,” said the Coast Guard member, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “It’s implying we’re making sh-t up, when the ones making up sh-t are down in Washington, D.C.

We were actually out there to see if we could spot any drones, because of all these sightings. Well, we found some drones. Or more accurately, they found us .

I’m terrible with measurements, but [the swarm] was about 80 to 100 feet above us. They had four propellers. Seven feet across. The flashing lights, like you’ve seen. The festive green, red, and white lights, around 20 knots, which is just over 20 miles an hour. 

Commercial airplanes don’t move like that. I’ve been out there when planes were coming in for landings in New York, and trust me, you can tell the difference. We’re not idiots, we know what drones look and sound like.

 I can’t pretend to know what’s going on, because I don’t, but they weren’t the types of drones you can buy at the store. These were government drones. If [the drone swarm] fired at us or engaged us in any way, we would’ve fired back.”

The coast guard vessels of today have only minimal air defense capability, most with only a single dual purpose 25m or 57mm gun that could be used to shoot down a drone. None have sea-ram, CIWS or other close in defense weapon system let alone anti-aircraft missiles. Equally astonishing, Coast Guard vessels have no anti-submarine weaponry on them at all, even though they are frequently sent to intercept narco-subs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiZ8i6bfaJk)</div>

AI is going to continuously improve, everyday, every week, every month. New models will be released each one breaking the previous benchmarks, hardware will continuously improve. 

Eventually,   
The line between the tech we have &amp; AGI, will be a very thin line.

The last few days have been discouraging because it seemed as though posted sightings had gone down.
However, according to New Jersey congressman Chris Smith, the drones have been “ramping up”

You even have people in Coast Guard who were tailed by a dozens of drones publicly stating that Kirbys comments about the CG misidentifying planes for drones is complete BS. 

We got members of the SSCI saying they're being told by the DoD that they can't track these things. 

NOW, you have the media reporting that over 15 counties in NJ are complaining about this bizarre smell coming from their tap water after seeing drones over their reservoirs for weeks.

Mass sightings now over on the West coast. Shit is about to get real crazy at this rate.</div>

It also forces the hand of Kirby, either he admits they aren't consumer drones or admits we can't take them down. Either one is interesting, not that anyone believes we can't stop a DJI in its tracks..</div>

They are claiming that the ETs have informed them of these incursions and that they will increase in prevalence around the globe. Like everything on this subject, it is good to keep our feet planted firmly on the ground before exploring the most out there possibilities. That said, part of the fun of all this, is the wonder of it all. Could we really be witnessing disclosure? What the hell could this all mean? Check out the Farsight group at farsight.org.

This is normal behavior for a lot of things even humans need. There's a reason the first installment of a video game series will start out with more minor missions that get you to practice the mechanics of the game and get familiar with the goals.

and from what I've seen this is intentional on the benchmark design side. They don't want to test o3 on how well it does ARC, they want it to understand how the ARC test works so that it can prove it knows what to do now.</div>
