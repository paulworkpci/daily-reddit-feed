If super intelligence is possible, and if all it takes to get there is research, and we figure out how to speed up research, and we figure out via research how to speed up research "automatically" via artificial intelligence, then super intelligence is just a matter of time.

The same holds true for anything you can hear nowadays about what AI would/could eventually lead to: cure to cancer or all diseases, nuclear fusion quantum supremacy, new materials, even faster than light travel...

If any of the assumptions in my second paragraphs is proven to be incorrect, the whole thing falls apart. Maybe it's impossible. Maybe it takes more than research (e.g. conditions and materials not accessible to humanity). Maybe recursive self improvement hits a wall. Maybe we hit a different human created wall.</div>

I had one hard brake hit in the 30 days, literally just one because someone pulled out in front of me.  They offered to lower my rates by 3% (they promised up to 30% in the advertising).  When I challenged this they explained that actual driving was a tiny % of the total potential discount and the rest was influenced by demographics.

Back then it was a 0-30% change.  Today they’ll even raise your rates when you use that garbage.  I just can’t believe after all this time people still volunteer to take part in that scam.</div>

The vast majority of the times it goes off, it's usually either the automatic gearbox made a jerky change and then it misreads the jolt as hard acceleration, or you hit a pothole or other bump while braking and then it reads that jolt as harsh braking.

It doesn't help that for "safety purposes", it reads any amount of braking more than using your big toe alone on the pedal as being "harsh" either.</div>

JEPA would only be wrong if his world model was wrong, he couldn't hallucinate like LLMs do, besides being able to ...</div>

Google and Facebook, the two companies popping out the most papers in the field (rivalling with actual universities) have been the most outspoken about their research beyond transformers.

OAI has been more confused/incoherent in its communication about the whole thing (blame Altman for that: someday "we found the algorithm that will solve everything" aka scaling is all you need, the other day "we need a few more breakthroughs/we reached the limit of the current paradigm"...). Them and XAI have thrown too many marbles on training and developping the current models, i wonder if they still have some left for more fundamental research.

Iirc, OAI was publishing a lot of papers 2ish years ago, idk if they kept up with it to the level of Google and Facebook.</div>

Besides Google and Meta, everyone is putting everything on the same basket. 

That's Yann Lecun's fears, that the overwhelming focus on LLM might actually slow progress to meaningful AGI systems.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Gemini finished in 35,000 steps and Claude didn't finish the game at all. This graph is wildly inaccurate. "Steps" also mean different things across harnesses and can't be directly compared. Time is a slightly better comparison: Gemini took 400h while o3 took 300h, though Gemini wasted 100h "training" in Victory Road after losing to the Elite 4 due to a Full Heal hallucination (can be blamed on my prompt tbh).

Edit: I misremembered some details. A more even harness comparison would be o3's 1st run that took 388 hours, which did not have a speedrun prompt (allowing glitch abuse) nor the knowledge search tool that was added in run 2. o3's "speedrun" took 240h, not 300h.</div>

Raw capability at intelligence tasks is what is key. Even if this was 100x more expensive, you simply can’t scale the others like that by simply running them 100x longer or 100 instances in parallel</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It is worse than that. Most of the compute power in the US is privately owned and can be used by anyone at-demand. Most of compute power in the EU is federal, locked behind institutions and grants. This is fine for some areas of research which are highly regulated, but absolutely kills private sector innovation. Almost all practical AI innovation comes out of the private sector or private-public collaborations right now. 

Innovation is not going to wait for endless series of approvals, permits, public funding, endless paperwork and a bureaucrat deciding if it is worth the public's time. We have more bureaucracy than China right now and people really do not realize it how this will kill our economy and geopolitical position.</div>

I'm not sure humans are solving it with, as you said, no special training or instruction. There is a quite a bit of evolution behind us, it is not just like we just popped into existence, making us creatures of this very specific environment. I feel ARC is a bit like asking us to be performing in 5D space, not sure our intelligence will be that general then.</div>

My training has meandared since then having dealt with injuries and general training malaise in the couple of years after before switching to CrossFit so I've never applied myself enough to hit PBs on the big 3 since.

The last 12-18 months, I've completed a couple of triathlons and Hyroxes, a marathon, an ultra marathon and a random ski erg marathon before dec...</div>

Really, before you do this you want to make sure you set your luggage on a tiled floor and absolutely don’t open it until all checks are made.

                        <div class="comment-body">During last vacations, we slept in no less than 6 different beds, as we moved around a lot. I checked everytime. Bedbugs,much like cockroaches, do not care at all if the place is clean or dirty, tidy or messy. So yeah, the only difference between a cheap or expensive hotel is that the expensive hotel might have more nuclear options to deal with bedbugs than the cheap hotel. 

So what I really want to know is how to spot early signs of an infestation, because my fear isn't to miss 300 critters crawling under the mattress, it's not seeing that one lone bedbug ready to lay eggs.</div>

Truth be told, if there is one bedbug ready to lay eggs, chances are there are many more.

My brother in law is in environmental protection for housing.  He always says about any infestation “if you see one, there’s at least a dozen more”. His explanation is quite accurate because although they may not be in your house/hotel, they are very close by.

But for bedbugs, I’d assume there will never just be one.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I am so upset they did not opensource Urania - the ML approach to perform a search in a massive space and prevent the training from collapsing:

&gt; We develop Urania, a highly parallelized hybrid local-global optimization algorithm

From their description it is very similar to my approach. I am also using a few epochs of BFGS training to find a local minimum and then a few epochs of no-gradient training to break free of it. In my case I use Differential Evolution for that, but it is super inefficient. Those guys a smarter them me (Duh!) and they did

&gt; Urania chooses a target from the pool according to a Boltzmann distribution, which weights better-performing setups in the pool higher and adds a small noise to escape local minima

This is awesome. I want to apply this to my problem as well. So sad they did not opensource it..</div>

Elon Musk is making chatbots that push the edge of going into pornography, and is already making plans to separate out chatbots for kids from those for adults, which will allow things to go further down that path.

In another year, there'll be xAI chatbots which can generate any porn scene you can imagine on the fly.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think AI will readily replace all things digital at some point in the fairly near future - from Onlyfans to porn. And it will be ∞-ly better than today. 

It’s a ginormous, largely untapped market that I feel today’s AI could readily manage if filters were removed plus a decent front end.

Sex robots feel much further out, outside of pure novelty.

I mean, Real Dolls today represent the high end sex doll robots and they typically cost $5-7k. And that’s just for static silicone models. 

With decent robotics + AI, they’ll likely premiere at $25-50k. And slowly dropping to $10k models in another 2-4 years. 

Decent sex robots won’t come until robotics makes considerable improvements in more basic areas - likely as back-end restaurant workers, hotel cleaners, electricians, plumbers, and many other hands on, blue collar work. If robots can do any of those jobs effectively, sex work should be a walk in the park.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I definitely agree with you. The argument that AI won’t replace porn because porn is “real” is so silly. Everything about the porn industry today is already fake. 99% of the time the “sUbSCriBe tO mY oNLyFAnS 🤪“ girl you THINK you’re interacting with is just some 3rd world chatter pretending to be the girl. What room is there still for the porn industry when AI could literally replicate your favorite anime waifu or make content of some random girl you saw on the train last week?

My guess is that once AI makes the porn/onlyfans industry obsolete it will likely just push those onlyfans &amp; instagram influencers towards irl escorting; I think with the increase in AI in general, there will grow a market for real human interaction similar to those “Rent-A-GF” services prominent in east Asia Japan, South Korea, etc.</div>
