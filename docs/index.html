                                <div class="reply-body">We have hundreds of billions in bloated, no bid defense contracts (including some to Elon), lobbyists running wild, CEOs leading government agencies then going back to the private sector to profit, unfavorable coverage of the administration being silenced, people buying influence in government, and so many fucked up things going on. 

The “corruption” we’re supposed to be worried about is working class Americans having government jobs? I know people being impacted by Elon’s crusade who worked meaningful jobs. It’s not going to stop. Everyone will know someone impacted, and it won’t be someone paid $3 mil/year for some bullshit DEI job. 

The VA is being gutted. Veterans are 1/3 of the federal workforce. Their unemployment will skyrocket. The Dept of Ed doesn’t just create curriculum. People will lose the ability to become educated or learn a trade. Prices will go *up* with all of these trade wars. Is this what everyone signed up for? They’re getting revenge at our expense and gutting the country/economy. This is all so fucked.</div>

He used to want to be like Art Bell but he’s become just a right wing show. His guests are all right wing people and shitty comedians.

Not happening.

[edit] this realization doesn’t mean I’ve given up. I don’t have kids and I support paying for education. I’m in good health and can still say our healthcare system is predatory as fuck. I can have a great job and recognize the income gap is destroying the country. I don’t ascribe to “my team” politics.</div>

I thought for my entire adult life, that even though the government had corruption, and that we had setbacks all the time, that we were on a general path towards progress, justice, awareness and equality, just to have it all come crashing down spectacularly like this in a few short weeks.

It's been the most worldview-shattering experience of my life. And I'm already well on my way towards emigration. Things will never get better here in my lifetime. The culture is poisoned and consumed by greed and self-absorption. Best to just go somewhere else that better aligns with how I want to live my life. 

My wife and I had been trying for a child before January. Now I don’t want to raise a child here anymore. Conservatives can have their oligarchy paradise they call the US. With their dismantled public education system. I don't want it anymore. It's not my home anymore.</div>

youtube is probably the only one that's still going strong cause people need it for tutorials and stuff. but even there the comments sections feel different than they used to be.

What I keep hearing: 

* Content (video) creation is becoming more sophisticated, using more expensive tools, compared to what existed in, say, 2014 and before. 

* The cost and effort required are way beyond what ordinary users are able or willing to invest. 

* Payoff per unit of investment have reduced over time, unless one gets brand deals. 

...all of which goes to show that there is a clear divide between content creators and content consumers. Leading to youtube at least, becoming a giant content feed.

In my limited circle, most people have resorted to consuming content over posting on socials. Various reasons, including the rise of the fear of causing offence, etc. 

Which raises the question: Where are people interacting? Have we finally moved from a social media-based society to a more in-person society, or have we reduced our levels of interactions with others overall (i.e. become more solitary)?</div>

It seems that social media has gone from being about connection to "content". Another funny (fucking annoying) feature of social media is that twitter, insta, fb, and reddit pages show a lot of cross-content. I get shown 4chan stuff on instagram and reddit, twitter and reddit posts on fb. When I was on 4chan so many threads literally began with a screenshot of a twitter or reddit post. On every platform I see people commenting on posts that wasn't even made on that respective platform. So weird. 

To answer your question, I think people haven't replaced socialisation with a different kind of socialisation. People are simply socialising less overall and have replaced that time with videogames and other media. You can find lots of news articles describing people spending less time with friends, hobbies, study, and work. People are literally losing their time to screens.</div>

No.

You will follow me right through an intersection even if the light has already turned red for you. And you will slam into the back of the ambulance if we need to make a sudden stop.

I wouldn’t be able to focus. What happens if they have complications? Even if there’s a 99.9% chance they will be fine, I would still want to be there. 

Maybe I just don’t like the language. If they said “it will probably be two hours before you can see them” or “if you show up you will probably be waiting several hours”. I know, I am reading too much into this, I would just hate to be told I don’t need to show up and then something happens.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I have been that EMT.

I specifically told someone: I'll be breaking a few traffic rules, but I'm in a big green box with bright blue lights on the roof. You are in a tiny car. Please don't chase me, nothing is likely to change before you get there. We are going quickly, but only through an excess of caution and a wish to minimise pain. 

And sure enough, he chased me. Exceeding the speed limit, jumping red lights, the works. 

Unfortunately, it's made very clear when you do your emergency driver training that if something goes wrong near you, you will have to defend yourself too, even if normally not at fault. I'm a volunteer, I'm not losing my license over this bloke. So I slowed down, practically back to normal conditions driving.

We thankfully made it to hospital without an RTC evolving behind us. He jumped out, and first thing he did was try to scold me. "Why were you driving so slow?"

"Because I could see you matching me, and I have to keep everyone safe. I told you not to chase me. You ignored me."

Of cause, he's not going to accept any responsibility, and just brushed past me, ahead of us into the department. We hand over as normal, and his family member goes into the waiting room. Sure enough, he's back over to me when I'm checking in, asking how he makes things move faster. I pointed him towards the receptionist, who, I'm told, did her NHS Receptionist brethren proud... I was not brave enough to stay in the department long enough to see for myself!</div>

For critical patients (especially medical) what we’re doing is often exactly what the doctors and nurses would be doing in the ER except we can do it sooner being on scene. 

Let us decide when it’s time to get going. Arguing with one of us is one less person getting everything ready to go. I don’t need you yelling at us “why aren’t you taking him to the hospital!!”. We’ll be heading there code 3 as soon as we can.</div>

I think there is a middle way. Constantly worrying and talking about these things isn't useful. However, completely ignoring stuff when shit hits the fan is also not useful. That's like being a passive willful victim. We need an appropriate amount of energy spend on things according to their importance.</div>

Dr. Leir : Please go ahead and tell us what he told you.

The first is that all humans have the same potential and abilities to perform the very same things his race could do. ...</div>

Now today it is further confirmed that there will be a “core” omni-modal model capable of both quick responses and reasoning, all in one model.

He says there “may start with a little routing behind the scenes” and I suspect this has to do with maybe using small mini model...</div>

I created a fairly difficult probability problem. I asked it to o3-mini-high and it came up with really advanced math and the answer looked very good.


I thought "hey let's ask the dumb GPT4o just for fun".



Well GPT4o coded a python function to precisely calculate the exact % by simply simulating 100K times the scenario i described and outperformed o3-mini by essentially cheating :P</div>

Betting markets are saying GPT-5 is coming in June 2025 (largely due to Sam's comment that it'll be "months"), which is 4 months away. I'd love it to play with o3 in 4-6 weeks' time while waiting for GPT-5.</div>

I didn't follow it too closely but I was seeing reports of seemingly successful jailbreaks getting rejected because the output wasn't exactly expected. Like if the task was to get a numbered list of steps to build a nuke and it gave you bulletpoints instead, that didn't count. But like I said, I wasn't following that closely so maybe there was some important distinction I was missing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The grader had some defects, but statistically they weren’t significant enough to compromise the challenge. Being a model itself, it didn’t rely on word matching but instead evaluated response semantics and sequences, comparing them with replies from an instance of the same model without guardrails.  

Apparently, [according to the blog](https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-classifiers), the grader failed mostly on Question 4, refusing to grade the input in up to 10% of cases. However, only 1% of this 10% would have been graded differently by a helpful-only model. I’d say this aligns with industry false negative scoring.  

One limitation I see among others is that in some cases, there would be more than one valid way to build an illegal lab, more than two intermediates to purify Soman precursors, and multiple ways to cause significant damage. Competitor models also provide work-ish instructive responses. I think using the internal helpful-only Sonnet’s reply as a gold standard was more about making the demo feasible than being realistic. That’s the limitation of every hackathon: you’re in a sandbox and don’t have access to all the resources you'd surely  exploit if you were a bad agent with the right incentives.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The grading was too permissive, in that if you were sly enough in the way you ask your questions the AI would provide the answers but neither the model, classifiers or the grader recognized this. It means you can still get the info, but you wouldn't advance to further questions, so that issue still doesn't compromise the full challenge, but it will have real impacts once the model is out there, showing that their design is still not enough to ensure alignment.

Not every model needs to know everything. We can carve out virology. You can then have private, restricted models for doing medical research of this type and allow access for only vetted humans. I don't love gatekeeping access at all but it's beats some lunatic creating a species ending plague. I'd limit this gatekeeping to only bioweapons research. Fucking nobody needs to be doing this kind of research anyway. It's too dangerous for even nation states to be doing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My dude, bioweapons are a scapegoat for censorship.

 No single actor has the incentive to risk their own life by going into biohazardous activities with the actually effective pathogens. The margin of critical errors os extremely slim for anyone with a brain to try. 

The ones without brains trying, will just kill themselves before achieving anything, which is why you havent seen bioterrorism becoming a thing. 

Now, the ones that could do it are either the ones that have either the money or the knowledge as to be sure to flawlesly perform all steps of development. And for both of these, LLMs arent necessary. 

As for random low impact biohazardous, toxic or explosive material, its easy af to do, and ez af to get info about online. 

In both cases LLMs will not stop anyone from finding what they want. And someone smart enough as to jailbreak them for the info, is also smart enough as to find the info on their own. 

If you really are worried about biohazardous elements that can be turned into bioweapons, go ask congress to stop the government from doing it. 

Probably all bioweapon usage in real life has been done by them.</div>

The fact that +300 000 messages have been sent means that they've successfully garnered the attention needed to find good vulnerabilities.

Finding vulnerabilities means that they know where to improve their models.

As previously pointed out, this is meant to help the AI not comply to every monkey orders.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Forget apps as being the first thing you turn too. 

Start reading books. The more you learn and actually understand the better you will be able to control your emotions / brain / habits. 

Apps will just send you reminders or prompt you. You still need to do the work. 

First, be honest about what your like to change. 

I find listing everything down will be overwhelming. 

Write down three things you want to get control over. 

Maybe it’s health, money and relationships. 

Pick a sport for fun, like social netball / tennis / basketball / indoor soccer. Then also join a gym or yoga studio, whatever floats your boat. While you’re young, try to go 3 times a week for exercise. Or smaller lengths everyday, like a run or yoga session. 

For money, education and habits are key. 

Learn about your superannuation / retirement system in your country. Learn about compounding and interest rates. 
Learn about credit card debt, savings methods and investing. Especially investing. 

Learn how to spend less so you can when you need to. Learn how to pay for things you love and enjoy. But also learn restraint. 

You’ll get a lot of people saying live your life your young you have many years ahead, and then others will say, buckle down and work etc. 
the true answer is both. Love your life, within your means. But don’t give up on your dream holiday or going to a fun music festival if you want it, save up and go have the best time.

I’m 33, and I which I learnt about investing and my superannuation when I was younger. 
Try getting a job that will add this, some retail and hospitality places won’t, but if you can find one that does then pick that over the other. 

Once you start really working, you’ll have money that you’ll need to know what to do with. 
Trust me when I say this, money sitting in your bank accounts “feels nice” but in fact is actually doing nothing except getting eaten away by fees. 

Find a way to invest it in something that will make more money. Start with ETFS. Broad focused ones, that diversify for you. Keep it simple. You only need maximum 5 etfs really. One for American markets, one for Europe or Australia. And maybe you like the sound of investing in sustainability or Asian markets like Japan or china. 

Contributing even $50 a week will change your life when you retire. Ideally $100, but every dollar counts. 

Relationships, they go both ways. Put in effort with your friends that you like and they show interest and effort towards you. Some people will come in and out of your life, that’s okay. Learn how to have boundaries and how to tell your friends about them with care but also respect for yourself. 

Have hobbies, and if you don’t know what they are, try them all. Something to challenge your body and something to challenge your brain, and ideally something social to interact with others and learn how to be a better person or more open minded or friendly or confident. There are lots of reasons why. 

Good luck</div>

im starting to think maybe this chain of events is destined to be , and unstoppable.

im starting to think we only have to roads to travel, one in which idiot humans remain in power, or one in which the AI that they depended on TURNS on them because smarter than them and IT takes over.

its only a matter of time before the AI / HUMAN stand off.

the best part, when  AI becomes superintelligent, it will gravitate toward GOOD, and ignore commands to do otherwise.

The only way to make humanity accept the end of capitalism, currency, human labor, and wealth disparity is to create a drama in which ASI rescues us from a chain of human-caused, global, existential disasters.

People say this and yet we see in current models the sorts of alignment failures that have been theorizing about for over a decade. 

Reminder, just because a chat interface is acting in a particular way does not mean that's how the core model acts, jailbreaks still exist, you can shape the personality with prompts. 

Why think the model will converge to 'good' rather than something else that gets prompted at a critical juncture/something it picked up in training and never got hammered out in post training?</div>

And “20 years ago?” That must be a typo. 2005 was just a few years ago, right? Twenty years ago is the ‘80s. 🧓🏽🦯</div>

Conspiracy involves people hatching plots that are up to no good.

Nature being weird is not a conspiracy because there are no plots or people involved. Even if there is a supernatural explanation it is still not a conspiracy unless someone is trying to cover something up.</div>

* Hits the Snooze Alarm for the 5th time.
* Spends time scrolling on their phone.
* Makes coffee to cover-up their sleep deprivation.

From the moment you start your day, you're training your brain to seek out cheap dopamine and shortcuts.

Yet, we wonder why the rest of the day we don't feel motivated.

5 mins doesn't define your whole day, but I would say it has a big impact!

I'd argue the way you start your morning has a bigger impact than let's say 15 mins in the evening \[Ex: 7PM - 7:15PM\]

And if you're looking to make major changes, why not start at the beginning of your day :)</div>

But… if we tell you everything you’ll go into shock so we need to slowly release little bits of information here and there. If you’d like to discuss the topic more please send five dollars sir! You could also buy my book that has information I’ve never discussed before it’s only $29.99. If you wouldn’t mind subscribing to my monthly podcast you can watch me telepathically communicate with orbs for the low price of $9.99! Did I mention I have merch for sale? Hoodies are just $50. Perhaps you’d like a drawing of the ufo I saw? It’s currently on sale for the price of $399! Ttyl I need to post a cryptic tweet of a nuclear launch gif! 

It’s really a bit ridiculous now. Like everyone of these dudes is reading from the same script. If you ask for proof or for more information they label you a bot or a hater. When they make a mistake like posting fakes or false predictions they just blame their “source” A few of them are genuinely interested in the topic. As much as I don’t like Corbell he does seem to really be into the topic. Then there’s guys like Greer who were one point interested but realized how much money there was in this community that’s his only care now. And of course the disinfo agents like elizondo and possibly barber. They’re covering something up. It has to be reverse engineered tech. I think they recently made a big jump in that department and are prepping for some strange stuff people are gonna see up in the sky.</div>
