                        <div class="comment-body">"In fact, Dyson concluded, by making the amount of energy expended per thought smaller and smaller the intelligence could have an infinite number of thoughts while consuming only a finite amount of energy."

"*The Landauer‚Äôs limit can be avoided*"

This is the flaw in the argument. The landauer's limit is that there is a minimum about of energy needed to flip a single bit, the smallest unit of information, as long as the temperature of the system is not exactly zero. In the scenario of heat death, the temperature of the universe cannot be zero because of conservation of energy.

So the assumption that the Landauer's limit can be avoided cannot be true. 

In layman's term, basically as time goes on, at some point, there is not enough energy for the intelligence to decide on a yes or a no. I would not consider that "a thought", and hence Dyson's argument is wrong.</div>

If you use anything like what we would recognize as a computer today, that's definitely a very "thermodynamically¬†dirty" machine, yes. Landauer‚Äôs limit is a very significant concern there, the thing literally runs on entropy. However, if you're specifically attempting to construct a thermodynamically resilient computer, that is also a thing you can (theoretically) do.


Note that thermodynamically resilient != perpetual motion, inefficiencies will always exist. We just might be able to get them under that limit</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Just for everyone's awareness, every time starlink does a launch, it causes UFO sightings. Within hours of the launch, it starts off as a short, blue/white luminous line that arcs across the sky slowly. Maybe a day later, it will be the same thing, but longer. Within a couple days, you can make out the individual satellites, and they keep spreading out. 

Another video of this starlink cluster for comparison: https://old.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1hvvvhm/same_ufo_here_in_brazil_where_they_obscured_me/

More starlink footage from a previous launch when the satellites were spread out more (this is what it's going to look like eventually):

Edit: there are also a couple websites you can use to identify a particular cluster of starlink satellites by plugging in the time you sighted them and your location. It will tell you about past sightings from your location, as well as future sightings and what direction to look for them.

I ran into the popular one a few years later on a train platform in Brooklyn at like 2am. He told me he was working on Wall Street now and introduced me to his fiance, who was an actual model. I asked about his brother and he said "he's basically a hermit now, he lives in Maine and doesn't really leave the house". That must have been rough growing up for the ugly one.</div>

Short, skinny, mousey hair; not even a plain face, an ugly face. One day, her 4 kids came into the store to see her; 2 boys, 2 girls, all between 18 and 24, college students I guessed. (I was a teenager at the time.) My God! These 4 people were absolutely gorgeous! The girls looked like they stepped out of a fashion magazine, tall, blonde, shapley, perfect smiles. (I immediately had a crush on both of them.) The guys were also tall, strapping fellows, blonde haired, athletic types with chiseled features. All 4 looked like they just stepped off the ship from Valinor. (LotR nerds will know what I'm talking about.) On top of that, they were super friendly, seemed genuinely nice, and made you feel like you'd known them for years even though you just met them. How in the world did this woman have 4 kids that somehow maxed out their Charisma rolls while she looked like an underfed Dwarf??? It's been 40 years and I still remember them.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is the ‚Äútail between the legs‚Äù concession Trump will make. If you increase tariffs to Canadian lumber and oil:gas‚Ä¶the US economy would implode overnight.  And there isn‚Äôt enough money to ‚Äúsecure‚Äù Canada‚Äôs border with a bullshit wall nor is there the funding (or human capital) needed for hundreds of thousands of new border agents along the Canadian border. 

So Trump will just wave his tiny hands around and wink while he says: ‚Äúwell, we don‚Äôt need tariffs or a wall for Canada - they are the FIFTY-FIRST state!‚Äù

Canada isn‚Äôt giving up their health care system to get fucked over by United Health down here. And his base is too fucking dumb to notice that Trump is going to bend over and give Canada a full pass from his fake tough-guy policies. 

And I‚Äôd LOVE for Canada to be the 51st state‚Ä¶the GOP would never win another presidential election. Adding Canada would tip the Electoral College into the Dems lap and we‚Äôd have universal health care in a month.</div>

They will probably still release a 3.5 Opus but not the original one.</div>

Is 2b enough  then again given claude rate limits and api prices maybe they're not losing as much dare say maybe even making a profit.

You have to deal with shitty kids, shitty parents, and shitty admin. It's not worth it and it's exhausting. You have way too many "my kid can do no wrong" type of parents. I'm not a teacher and would never consider it for those reasons.

I also have to deal with kids who want to wrestle but their parents watch one match and pull them out. Parents are way too soft on their kids.</div>

If narrow AI achieves superhuman abilities in areas like maths and programming, it could drive major advancements in AI hardware and architectures. This includes alternatives to GPUs/TPUs like neuromorphic chips, artificial neural networks transitioning to spiking neural networks, and transformers evolving into spiking transformers as possible examples. These (or similar) innovations could lead to AI systems with large, scalable memories that generalise, adapt, and learn efficiently. In this sense, narrow AI could be the path to AGI.

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm pretty much the same honestly, I really look up to those type of people that just know a bit of everything and can help people in multiple areas so I kinda want to be like one, but it seems maybe since I don't have my life sorted yet nor a good routine, trying to learn multiple things at the same time ends up being very overwhelming and daunting, so that definitely makes it hard. 

For what I've seen/read, there's this thing that some believe called the cognitive load theory and because of that, Justin Sung  (he has a YouTube channel about how to learn stuff so maybe that could be useful for you) created this rule called "the crowded forest" that implies, just like growing a tree, your learning needs "the nutrients" and the time to grow. So basically you don't want to learn as much as possible and plant multiple seeds, but rather you should make a list of all things you want to learn and prioritise 1 or 2 untill it's sort of an habit and you feel like you have a solid base.

Also what you can do is ask for chatgpt to make like a connection between the topics you want to learn, so like put the list of things you want to know more about and let it show a combination of topics you could learn, taking in consideration their compatibility and choose the one combo you feel more atracted to. 

About that last part, there's this free app that Im starting to use that it's called "obsidian", it's a note app that makes automatically a mind map. It's a bit tough to use in the beginning but you can just keep it simple and there are tutorial on YouTube to help. I feel like learning is just so much more effective when you take your own notes and tou take your time to write them and connect ideias, it just sticks better. Also check out this guy called "Benjamin Keep, PhD" he reads scientific papers and tells you what's the best way to learn different topics, that could help! Good luck!</div>

Over the past six months, I enjoyed sustained success with keeping track of my interests by using a general Interest tracker from which I select a new interest (up to a maximum of three open subjects) to focus on full time. This is in addition to my attempts to learn an additional language and my full time job as an attorney.

To dedicate adequate time to each subject matter, I split my days into "Subject Matter" based time blocks and I use an AI scheduler (Motion) to help populate my calendar with the tasks I've identified as next steps (as determined by my below course plan). I presently have projects going on relating to learning more about:

* Neuroscience
* Neurolinguistic Programming
* Impact of Diet on Mitigating Adverse Symptoms of ADHD/ASD.

I used AI (ChatGPT) to create a: (i) Background, (ii) Familiarization or (iii) Deep Dive "course" for each subject listed and then follow the tasks until I've mastered an areas to my satisfaction (which is not the same thing as absolute mastery). During those tasks, I do take notes by hand and I review them during my weekly "Neuroscience Review" or as appropriate. I close the subject in my AI Scheduler once completed and add it to my mind map (or memory palace if it's something I need to frequently encounter).</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I struggled just like that for 6 years when I was a teen. Undecided about which interest or hobby I want to learn because I had so many to choose from. The end result, I did nothing.

Honestly, the best way to overcome this is through the process of elimination. What is the most beneficial skill/topic to learn now? How does it relate to your goals for the future, and what are you willing to sacrifice? Time, money, etc. 

One way would be to use a mind map to clear out all this clutter and properly design a Blueprint for specific, measurable steps or actions towards your desired goal. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, some sticky notes or a journal is more than enough. 

Finally, don't forget that you are free to learn more about other topics later down the line whenever you want to. You are not exclusively limited to what you chose. Everyone has their own skills or capabilities when it comes to learning and applying new skills.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Dopamine fasting is like traditional fasting, but for your brain. A dopamine fast helps reset your mind by reducing overstimulation. The idea is simple: give your brain a chance to rest and recalibrate by stepping back from the constant flow of dopamine-triggering activities.

Here‚Äôs how to get started: pick one low-pressure day to focus on. Start the morning without your phone, TV, or music. Instead, take a quiet moment to notice how you feel without the usual distractions.

Throughout the day,...</div>

It makes sense now why i do the things i do, its the dopamine! the rush...   Im a shopaholic, i love the excitement of buying that new thing, and i cant get away from any drama or argument online or otherwise.  Its definitely good when i step away from all of this tho.  I wont stop enjoying music tho or video games, its just being online is a big trigger and it doesn't really matter in the big scheme of things</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">May I recommend to you the book "how to ADHD" from Jessica McCabe. In it she explains the problem with dopamine for Brains (her words for people with ADHD). 

From my experience a dopamine fast isnt a good idea for Brains, because we already struggled with too low levels, that lead to struggles with executive functions and focus. Maybe refraining it staying away from easy dopamine ( social media for example) and instead actively seeking homemade dopamine sources (things that you do because you enjoy them, like hobbies, being creative, self-care, bit also sports)

Having addictive behavior patterns ( behavior that is harmful to you, like excessive shopping or in my case eating to mich sugar) is something that is common for Brains, because of this deficit in dopamine. Here it can helps to have this homemade dopamine, there is a nice technique called dopa- menu. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-6WCkTwW6xg</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That article is pedantic, inconsistent, and contradictory. The article dismisses the literal ‚Äúdopamine detox‚Äù label (because you can‚Äôt actually stop your brain from making dopamine, which most people who do this practice are aware of) but then says the underlying technique, which is essentially CBT, does work to break bad habits. They're calling out the misleading term ‚Äúdetox‚Äù while admitting that the practice behind it is effective. Almost every dopamine detox video I've seen points out that you're not actually detoxing dopamine from your body, it's just a catchy term for it.</div>
