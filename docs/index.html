This tag usually shows up when there’s someone internally managing the pipeline and trying to fill the role quickly.

Is there any way of doing the equivalent in the app? Tried looking around the search filters but not sure I saw anything like that. Thanks in advance!

Edit: From the answers I'm getting there does not seem  to be a similar workaround in the app itself. Browser it is,  then. Thanks all!</div>

People suck. People lie, cheat, mock, and belittle you for little to no reason; they cannot understand you, or you them, and they demand things or time or energy from you. Ultimately, all human relations are fragile, impermanent, and even dangerous. I hardly have to go into examples, but divorce? Harassments? Bullying? Hate? Mockery? Deception? One-upmanship?

Not too long ago I and my family were broke and close to homeless.  We went to food pantries in the areas, which were all at churches, and we got lots of free food at all of them.

Some of them asked us if we were on government programs like SNAP (food stamps) or Medicaid (basically to determine if we were really poor), but some didn't ask us anything at all.  They didn't preach at us or try to convert us.  They just gave us food (and some even had other products they gave out for free, like diapers and toiletries).

They basically saved our lives or at least kept us from starving.

If you go to a Sikh temple they will feed you for free.  Also no questions asked and no preaching.

I'm also reminded of a Radiolab program I heard about the [Carnegie Hero Award](https://www.carnegiehero.org/), and one story in particular from that episode where a man who was waiting at a subway stop with his kids saw a man had fallen in to the tracks.  He immediately jumped down to help him and when he saw there was no more time before the train hit them, instead of saving himself by jumping back on to the platform he lied down on top of the other man to shield him from the train.  Amazingly, they both survived as the train passed over them.

Just one impressive example of someone risking their life to save another.  But there are countless more.  Some like this person do so in the spur of the moment.  Others dedicate their entire lives to helping others at great risk to themselves.  Yet others help in less dramatic ways, often for free or even at their own expense.

That's not to say that there aren't people in the world who do horrible things.  There certainly are.  But viewing the entire human race as malignant is a seriously distorted view of humanity.</div>

huh? people are not in survival mode. you are a coddled humans with human rights, a army who will protect them against slavers or people who exploit them, and have a roof over their head and food on their plate. people are not some survival tribesman in the wilderness, fighting against nature to live

&gt;  
 People are being told that the only way to success, wealth and security is through exploiting other people.

huh? people are told lots of stuff, but that doesnt mean they are stupid enough to believe it. i can tell people im a teleporting space crab, but does that mean they are stupid enough to believe it?  
people act morally bad because they are trash greedy selfish virtue signalling hypocrites. stop trying to sugar coat people's behavior and pretend its anything other than that

 Those who disagree will not be successful.

yeah sure, but thats just playing on how greedy and selfish people are. if they could they'd sell their children into slavery for a mercedes

I don't think that'll work out. We already have very capable models that you can run locally, and we have a ton of competition. That means you'll end up with the perfect ad filter right on your PC. One of the benefits of AI systems, after all, is that you have to interact far less with the original source of information and instead can view everything filtered through AI. That's only going to improve going forward.

See how they interact with the computer in StarTrek:TNG, that's the future of AI (and in large parts already possible today). Any attempt to enshittify a service will just be filtered away by your AI, and you'll just be dealing with raw information. The ad filled world we have today is a result of removing control from the user, AI is giving a lot of that control back into the user's hand.

On phones, it's a bit more problematic, since Apple and Google control everything that happens on there. You'll have to hope for EU to open that up.</div>

it's probably hard to do, but it doesn’t seem harder than what they’ve already achieved. they could even make the model output whole fonts, allowing you to edit the text in the image. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re saving that for when they release a tool that gives full control over the output</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That's definitely been pretty rare in recent years.  It looks like he is getting pretty close to beating [Strom Thurmonds's record of 24 hours and 18 minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strom_Thurmond_filibuster_of_the_Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957#:~:text=Thurmond%20was%20also%20allowed%20breaks,the%20Senate%20as%20of%202025.)  Not sure how productive it is but at least he isn't reading the ~~phone book or~~ something silly to keep going.

  
Edit: Researching this and it appears that the stories of reading the phone book are apocryphal.  I couldn't find anything to support that claim.  I skimmed through the [Congressional Record](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/Thurmond_filibuster_1957.pdf) and it appears that he read state laws on civil rights to try to claim that a national law was unnecessary and a bunch of historical documents.  It was probably boring enough to anyone in the audience that most of it was only marginally more interesting than the phone book.</div>

Sometimes it looks like productivity.

You’re not lying on the couch doing nothing but you’re updating your to-do list, replying to messages, organising folders or cleaning.
It feels useful and it especially feels safe.

That’s what makes productive procrastination so dangerous. It gives you just enough of a dopamine drip to feel like you’re progressing without ever having to face the discomfort of the one thing that actu...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I know I want to procrastinate sometimes so I don't mind productive procrastination.

I have my regular to do list and then another list of things I can procrastinate on. These are great for when I need to take a break from my work. Everyone needs a break from time to time.

Today's procrastination list is: Sort out a bowl of junk, pick fruit that have dropped on the ground under our trees, sweep and mop the bathroom, wash sheets and hang them out to dry. None of these tasks will take more than 10 minutes of my time and a few chores done during the day means less for me to do in the weekend.

Other things that aren't on my list are: fill up my drink bottle, check on my pet rabbit and give him a kiss and a pat, water plants.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Of course! Taking breaks is very important. We all have to recharge our batteries sometimes and you can only be truly productive if you take regular breaks. However, it’s important to distinguish between productive procrastination and taking active breaks. Productive procrastination means avoiding the task you actually need to do until it’s too late, whereas breaks are actively and consciously taken between periods of working on the task. Nevertheless I love the idea of the to do list. Your to do list is a really great idea for what to do within these breaks instead of doomscrolling</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Americans are generally stupid. Many feel we saved the world during ww2 and the world owes us.

I remember (think on John oliver) they showed a study - most Americans felt the world relies too much on our aid - and that at most 10% should be spent elsewhere.

Most people thought closer to 1/5th of federal tax money's went overseas...it's literally 1% though.

So it's mainly misinformation or lack of knowledge coupled with the belief the world owes us that sparks it.

Add in nato and trump term 1 and lot of people started pushing the 'they don't pay their fair share' shit even more, which added to it.

And now? Idfk what to tell you. Large number parrot social media and fox which is totally against the EU now...which means MAGA is.

Not to mention russia russia russia 🙄</div>

gen-z (and older people too) have had their attentions spans stolen.  they didn't give them away.

this is the modern world that our billionaire overlords want.  pacified people sitting at home, consuming through their phones, and not building any social cohesion in the real world.

because real world social cohesion leads to collective action, which leads to resistance to fascism and oligarchic takeovers.

you were pacified, in other words.  you didn't necessarily choose to be pacified.</div>

Recent studies suggest that Generation Z (born approximately 1997–2012) may be the first generation to experience a decline in certain cognitive abilities compared to previous cohorts. This trend contrasts with the "Flynn Effect," observed throughout the 20th century, where each new generation scored higher on IQ tests than the last.​

[https://www.thetimes.com/article/young-losing-their-iq-advantage-over-old-k3pg2j8pj?utm\_source=chatgpt.com](https://www.thetimes.com/article/young-losing-their-iq-advantage-over-old-k3pg2j8pj?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

A study by Northwestern University researchers analyzed intelligence testing data from 2006 to 2018, revealing declines in three out of four cognitive domains: verbal reasoning, matrix reasoning, and letter and number series. Interestingly, spatial reasoning scores increased during the same period. ​

We literally just suck lol. only generation to actively fair out worse, than previous generations. And honestly? I don't sympathize with my generation anymore. Nobody is forcing us on social media, we weren't "born" into this, we fully choose what we do with our own autonomy. Gen Z is old enough now to take responsibility for shit. we're getting close to our 30s on the older side.</div>

**Case Update:**

Originally there was a panorama that had been put together and a raw photo of the Mars Tic-Tac Object which could be found at mars. nasa . gov however, the panorama was soon taken down, but it was saved by the person who had originally found the object (link and pic in the OP).

Physical evidence of the Manhattan project made it's way to the USSR in less than a year. It was smuggled out by spies. THE most important technology of world war 2 did not make it more than a year without leaks. Compare that to the alien conspiracy which has NEVER had physical evidence at all. Somehow the government is so hyper competent that it can keep a multi-generational secret... but not the atom bomb. Compare this idea of hyper-competence of the government with the leadership we see and uhhh I have no idea how the people state an 80 year coverup as fact.</div>

He's spent literally hours and hours over the course of over a decade describing billionaires and politicians as self interested ghouls whose only goal is to gain as much power and wealth as possible....but literally the second the billionaires and politicians start inviting him out to dinner and hanging out with him it turns out that actually, the billionaires and politicians are pretty cool and just misunderstood!</div>
