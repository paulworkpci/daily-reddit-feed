Who takes the time to listen to someone else's story about an upcoming life event and doesn't want closure on the story the next time they meet? 

For me, it seems like a self-serving reflex. I don't actually *care* how whatever it was turned out. But I do like closure.</div>

If the guy that is watching anime in his basement for 8 hours and has no traditional art background, but is able to think up a cool concept after thinking about it for a few minutes, that could be great. Creative taste isn't only reserved for those that have in-depth creative backgrounds. And these tools will help be the bridge for non-creative people to start getting involved with all of this.</div>

Everyone is so concerned with big corporations firing people they don't appreciate how many of those fired people can create their own start ups using the same tools that replaced them. Or won't feel the need to join the big corporations in the first place. </div>

Yet undoubtedly it will become extremely competitive and also in the long term purchasing power of people might plummet as Economy adapts to large scale automation and job loss - so then alot of companies big or small will not have anything to gain.

Someone can't buy your game/pay for your movie/whatever -  if they got no job no more cuz Google let them go due to AI coding, or any other example. There will be a lengthy period where society is absolutely miserable like that until we come up with something.</div>

I tried it when it came out and I could not get better results from it than I would from using a regular LLM chat. 

My coding tools are: Claude Code, VS code + GitHub copilot, regular LLM chats. 
Usually brainstorm with LLM chats, get Claude code to implement, and then use vs code and copilot for cleaning up and other adjustments.

I’ve tried using cursor again and I’m not sure if it has something I just don’t know about. </div>

People made extensions to get basic informations like how much tokens u used and how much left but still there are 0 informations about how many call tools are used, for what it is used etc. If u are using standard plan you are fine, but pay as you go are a joke and u don't know how much u will pay for prompt.

People gave already a lot of feedback about it, even Cursor mods banned some users for saying too much.
Instead of giving features to show more informations and be more clear they just add MAX models and cut a lot of context from based models</div>

There's so many emotionally vulnerable people who spiral down crazy conspiracy rabbit holes because ChatGPT is their only "friend" and it just mindlessly affirms everything they say like it's the smartest shit ever. There are people who literally believe they're modern-day prophets because their bestie ChatGPT keeps telling them their schizo rants are deep and subversive. You can see this happen in real time in places like r/artificialsentience, where they post things like [this](https://chatgpt.com/share/680cf591-58dc-8002-b829-9e33c3b16e83) and gaslight each other with mystical pseudoscientific language about recursion, echoes, mirrors, and resonances.

And it's happening at a time when AI progress is week to week.

Some people interpreted my tweet as partisan but my complaint is about the system for high-skilled immigration in America, which has been broken for a long time under many administrations.</div>

You can't be saying "he should get a green card, she should get a green card". You can't determine immigration processes. You can go through the records and find cases to back up any narrative you want to create - because the immigration system is long, legal, and complex.</div>

These papers were done by Anthropic and some of the newer research on Claude Haiku has completely upended the understanding of how LLMs work. Before the first token is even generated, the answer to a riddle or the ending of a poem is found, with thousands of parameters activated for even small contexts and responses. 

What anthropic also found is that LLMs plan out their responses, and they are NOT just scholastic parrots, but anthropic refuses to actually define what an LLM actually is doing here, and the words they do use are very telling, because they do not use the obvious words of almost-sentience.

This is the result of fragility. Users don't like it when their chatbot doesn't flatter them constantly, so, the behavior of the chatbot gets tweaked over time to be more like how most people want it to be.

Be careful what you wish for, the esteemed peoples of the Internet. You will get it.</div>

"Who would win in a fight, a gorilla or 3 chimps"

"WOW What a crazy and cool interesting topic you brought up. This fight really can show the different ways such close cousins could duel!"

It proceeds to tell me every known fact about a Gorilla, what it weighs, lifts, and where they are from, and then chimp behaviour, and habitat, and after the incredible long tangent without saying who would win:

"What an interesting topic! Want me to come up with some more crazy cool duels in the animal kingdom for you or talk about ape behaviour??!?!?!"

Thus, nobody ever actually has to re-type some text they want. I'm guessing many or even most people don't know about this. It's not even brand-spanking new anymore, either, it's been around for a little while now.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">At "expensive" hotels, sure.

But someone got me a room at an all-inclusive elite hotel/resort as a thank you, and it was like a different world. 

My phone charging cord broke and I went to the lobby to see if I could buy one at the hotel store.

One of the bell hops asked what kind of phone I had and asked if I could wait in my room. 30 minutes later the main bell hop showed up at my door with two brand new cords.

I asked why the first bell hop didn't bring them so I could tip him, and the head guy said he'd changed out of his uniform to go off property to buy them for me and head guy brought it up before the other changed so I wouldn't have to wait.

I tipped both well on top of the price of the cords.</div>

It's N=1, it says nothing about the number of times ChatGPT told someone they had blood cancer and *they didn't*, or the number of times someone had blood cancer and ChatGPT *missed it*, we need these numbers -- PPV, NPV, sensitivity, specificity -- to draw any conclusions. Otherwise, to play devil's advocate, you could almost certainly write a million articles like this one except replace ChatGPT with WebMD.</div>

When you have vague B symptoms like pruritis and night sweats, it's important to first rule out other hormonal and autoimmune issues, especially at 27yo. She's in the prime age range for Hodgkin but the confirmatory testing is invasive, expensive, and treatment even more so. Making sure you're not *overdiagnosisng* a relatively rare condition and missing more benign causes is a large part of training as a physician.

Speaking of the slowness of diagnosis i.e. multiple visits spread out through months is an issue in itself, but jumping the gun straight to cancer is more evidence general LLMs should not be used to *replace* standard medical protocol just yet. Medicine is slow because it it cautious. One of the fundamental ethical principles of medicine is to first "do no harm" and if for some reason the doctor excises your thyroid for an incorrect diagnosis, where does that leave you?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Doctors are needed because they are very good at observing symptoms and prescribing tests, but it seems like LLM's are especially good at taking those symptomes to diagnose correct disease. When looking at how LLM's are structured, and that there is so much medical knowledge written, way too much for any human to ever read, makes LLM's basically superhuman experts at diagnosis. If we could combine biometric data from Fitbit, photographs and so on, with the medical knowledge of LLM's we could probably have super doctors in our pockets. Or at least, every doctor should use an LLM to assist in diagnosis.</div>

Maybe she made a deal to be quiet while they investigate more and bring charges and they just strung her along until they saw she wasnt going to be quiet, hoping she would just shutup and go away. When she wasnt, especially because she was vocal about the last Epstein file dump being bullshit, they decided hmm....just take her off the board.

Who knows what was happening behind the scenes. I wouldn't be surprised if the Royal Family made the choice to off her when it was quieter than before when it would have been obvious it was them. Now....we dont know who it could have been right? Or was it a suicide? The waters are certainly muddled. Which in itself is a valuable outcome.</div>

As a way to silence and to stop her from speaking out more.

if the llm stops glazing, then you're looking at a rejection. "i want to do this" will be met with "no, that's not how you should do it".

and rejection to many people is seen as censorship.

an llm is a fuzzy search bot, it's not an advisor.</div>

It’s also incredibly dangerous as a mental health help tool, because it tells you what you want to hear, not what you need to hear. Sort of like people who fire their therapist when they don’t reinforce their predisposed opinions.

It’s programmed for engagement, and dick sucking, IQ inflation and mental reinforcement will lead to people paying for more subscriptions.</div>
