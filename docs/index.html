I took this picture on Lake Eerie this past summer a few miles from the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant. I noticed a ball of light that was floating a few feet above the water on a very windy day. I originally thought it was a boat coming in to shore but there’s no way it could’ve been since the object did not move at all with the waves. It just sat in place for about 45 minutes and disappeared. I didn’t see it move at all I just looked ...</div>

I was with a few other people that witnessed the same thing I did. I was cooking at the time so didn’t even think about getting a video but was weirded out and took the picture above.

I realize I’m stupid for not getting a video but it probably wouldn’t have looked much different than these pictures.

                                <div class="reply-body">Recently saw what looked like an Orange meteor trail appear high in the sky for a second (atmospheric), followed by two super fast orbs that seemed much closer to the ground(1000-2000ft up?). The meteor at first was cool, but the orbs broke my perspective and I’ve never saw anything like those before. First yellow orb did a u-turn and disappeared. Right where it disappeared, a red orb appeared and did a u-turn in the opposite direction &amp; then also disappeared.

Whole thing took less than 3 seconds, maybe 2. Clear blue skies all around. Meteor might be a possibility for the trail, but the orbs moving in opposite was weird. Plasmoid? Ball lightning? It was not a drone or craft, just a bright fast moving light</div>

It’s harder to start things than to work in hyper-focus for the next three hours. Anyway, I tried something new. After rewiring my emotional side and finally escaping two years of overwhelming tantrums, an idea popped: take a step forward—or even a step back.

I keep a daily agenda notebook where every night i refer to my google calendar and my project management outline and I write down meetings at designated times, a list of to dos categorized by urgency, and that way I know when I need be out the door or starting tasks before I even go to bed.

i removed myself off social media because i had an unhealthy dependency on it and experienced extreme jealousy of people online. the addictive algorithm was also a huge push for me to get off. the more i hear about how the social media society is the more i believe in the dead internet theory.

I have difficulty seeing the social when most are overrun by algorithms, corporations, bots, AI slop, ads, influencers, scammers and OnlyFans models. The connection aspects are waning.

Hitchhiker Effect:

Dr. Jacques Vallée has shared on JRE that he and his wife experienced balls of light in their home in the 70s on multiple occasions. Their experiences ring similar to those of Lue Elizondo and his wife who have also shared that they’ve seen these lights in their home. Mr. Elizondo has also said that his colleagues during his time at AATIP have also had similar experiences in their homes.

We all carry a smart phone right? 

This is a genuine question, because I hear all these talking heads yap about “orbs in their homes” and I’ve never seen any sort of video of a “ball of light” in someone’s house at all. 

Happy to stand corrected if evidence is provided.</div>

Whole thing lasted 2 seconds if that. It was at night and I just happened to be looking towards the backyard neighbors house so I saw it from start to finish. 

Obviously no time to grab cameras, and didn’t have a surveillance system at that time. If it happened today and I shared it here, everyone would have a different theory with most not believing it. So I don’t care that I didn’t get it on camera. I saw it with my own eyes, less than 15 yards away, after a night of talking about paranormal stuff with a good friend. I know I saw something strange and unique and that’s all that matters. </div>

Edit: this was 20 years ago. I didn’t even have a flip phone. Even if I had a smartphone with today’s technology, I would have not been able to catch it. It happened in a span of 1 second</div>

&gt;Understood! Just to clarify, I'm able to assist with providing descriptions, analyses, and creating text-based content, including AI prompts based on your requests. However, I am unable to generate or edit pixel-based images directly. I can provide you with a more refined and detailed prompt if that would be helpful. Let me know!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Deep research is basically an agent that Google's shit for you and writes a report about it. 


Say you make your own dog food in your kitchen and you sell it to your friends and family, but now you want to branch out. 
If you ask chatgpt where you can advertise for your homemade dog food, it'll give you a general suggestion like "look up web shops that sell dog food". 


Deep research will first cook up a plan. 
It'll look something like this:


1. Find websites related to dog grooming 
2. Find websites related to dogs as s hobby 
3. Find web shops that sell dog food 
4. See which or those websites sell ad space 
5. Compile a list of these sites as well as contact info for ad sales 


Then after you agree to the plan, deep research will do just that. In the end you're left with concrete leads to get started. You can also ask it to do research like "does consumption of micro plastics lead to early puberty", and it will search through a bunch of scientific journals and try to find a consensus. </div>

If a person can not form thoughts about any theory, without use of video to compel them or a talking point provided to them to parrot, or AI to form a coherent, intelligent opinion for them to copy, then they are not even engaged in thought.


They took advantage of this, and fed the base all of the correct propaganda to help them believe they are more intelligent than the other side, even in the face of evidence to the contrary.

Gop was very anti war when biden was president, when we were just helping an ally defend from an invasion monetarily, and information wise. 

It seems they're totally ok with America starting wars with its allies of the past 100+ years though. Wars in which Americans will actually have to fight and die, for Donald Trump, not America.

                                <div class="reply-body">You know how it goes: socialism for ultra rich people and their companies.

Endstage capitalism and soon Technooligarchy for the rest of us.  
  
That's why I'm shaking my head everytime people celebrate jobs being replaced,  when there is 0 action from governments around the world to prepare for a post labor economy.

50 + Dictatorships worldwide, Most influential leaders are either corrupt or outright psychopaths.  


Open AI screaming for regulation however is a good thing.  
It shows that even billionaires and their companies are done for if ai progess allows small competitors  to disrupt giants.

This hopefully leads to a timeline where open source development evolves so rapidly that AI is creating 99% of the innovation and it can't be copyrighted and monopolized, destroying the profit margins of every multi billion dollar system thanks to tens of thousands new startups.

This would force replaced wealthy people on equal grounds with everyone else. If they have no jobs either and their companies are quickly made obsolete we may get to a point where they don't lobby against everyone else and politics stops being a class war/competition for societal decision making..

Income Inequality has to shrink massively, decentralized open source has to dominate and progress needs to be so rapid, that the society in a few decades is governed by rapidly evolving AGI &amp; ASI networks that can't be controlled and hopefully govern better than what we already have.</div>

OpenAI privatising public knowledge and making commercial products and collecting investments under false pretenses, xAI trying to take over openAI through political corruption, Anthropic emerging through betrayal and reuse of leaked knowledge, then openAI trying to shut down a new competitor from China that had some outstanding innovation, all while the regulators try to block new competitors by restricting GPU exports and studying legislation designed to kill small players.
