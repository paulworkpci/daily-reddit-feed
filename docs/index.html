Then again, were the population/voters ever given fair parameters and roadmaps for "success" in all this? My personal criterion for "success" would have been "successfully integrate Afghanistan as a sustainable democratic western-style first world country within the next 50 years" but clearly no one involved put forth a reasonable, significant effort towards that—i.e. money, manpower, and political action; literally sending experts, police, and business opportunities in droves over there, for example. Kinda like how the world's collectively failing Haiti right now.</div>

If there's evidence it gave him useful information on bomb-building then fair but everything I've seen is he asked it for stuff he could've gotten via a google search.

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, I find times like these fascinating. While I was getting my degree in American politics, one of my favorite activities was to try to reset my brain away from today's bias, and put my mindset into the times of the day to understand why certain politicians (like Andrew Jackson) were so honored in their day before falling away to historical review. 

Even with the 1984 landslide, the hagiography of Reagan didn't start until near the end of his second term, and really didn't get codified until the USSR fell. Nixon also won a landslide in 1972, but there was nowhere near this level of personal identification with a politician at the time. We really have to go back to "Camelot" JFK, and FDR during his third and fourth term to find times when people based their personality on a political figure anywhere close to the extent people do these days. 

Teddy Roosevelt, for example, thought he had that kind of following, but was rejected by his former party when he ran as a third party candidate. 

That's why I'm lucky to have family members who worship Trump, but also like sports and movies so I can just always steer conversations that way.</div>

"Well, Trump isn't officially in office yet so you have no reason to believe he'll actually invade Greenland. NO FAIR CRITICIZING HIM."

Not even kidding. It's the same argument abused wives say when their husbands berates then and hits them and they say "but he doesn't really mean it."</div>

Before smartphones, specifically back when I was little (the early 2000s and before) everyone lived life and didn't have a phone addiction. We went to the movies. We went over a friends house and hung out. We went shopping. We read books. We went to school. And most of all, we weren't on our phones too much. Or even on our phones at all. Now all you see is people on their phones. I wish we could go back to how things used to be.

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree with you. My friends and I did a lot of different things together. We built junk forts, gamed in person, cooked together, threw ridiculous parties, played manhunt using the whole neighborhood, rode bikes, got lost in the woods, hiked, made bonfires, hit the beach, hungout in parking lots just talking with our cars, made art, made up games, played board games...I miss the 90s. We did watch TV and go to the movies but it was always a social event. I remember waiting in line for midnight premeires or everyone gathering to have dinner and watch an episode of a series we were obsessed with.


Cellphones suck. I remember when my friends first got them. I was the last person to get one (like years later) and I can distinctly remember coming to hangout and everyone just sitting on their phones instead of talking and it sucked. It's only gotten worse. 


The internet was great at first but its become awful as well. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Totally agree on that. Most people live either with phones , internet and all and are addicted to the scrolling and all , the other group like OP are sick and tired of it and are yearning for a life without phones, internet and so or at least 75 procent less. 

The problem is both ways of living aren't working in modern society.

I think the key is to be very aware of your amount of use and find ways or tactics to minimalize and optimize the way you are using your phone and internet in general.. its's a journey but you can gain good results</div>

Those days felt more present, like you were truly there, in the moment, without a digital tether always pulling at your sleeve.

Maybe dust off a book, find a local event to attend, or just leave the phone in the other room more often. It's still possible to unlock those off-screen moments.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly this is always on my mind - do I have to worry all that much about retirement?

I just lost my well paying job. Wife is stay at home mom. We have some money saved, but I wanted a bit more before we FIRE (retire early) for good. Another 5 years of work (with wife going back to work too). We have perhaps enough money for a lean-FIRE in Europe as is anyways. And I'm thinking about just pulling the plug instead of looking for a job in this shitty tech job market. Even if we spend more than the investment income allows.

With the way automation is progressing there is a very good chance that most human workers are going to be obsolete within the next 10-20 years (especially white collar, less so in trades, but that will come too eventually). Some kind of UBI (Universal Basic Income) is quite likely in the developed world to just keep the economy from completely collapsing as unemployment rises rapidly even as productivity skyrockets. Or lower retirement age, etc, etc.

Another darker scenario would be future catastrophe like global nuclear war, climate change causing collapse of the ecosystems, economic and civilizational collapse, annihilation by AI, in short a scenario where you are most likely dead or a grimdark world where money has no value anymore anyways. Or you know you can just drop dead from the myriad of possible causes in the next year or two - so why not FIRE ASAP to enjoy the life while the sun still rises?</div>

Like pennies per book written, or video created. The value of an agent's work will approach the value of the electricity and hardware required to do the work. We already see this with some digital currencies, as only 'miners' which are in ideal locations (low electric cost, low heating cost) can make any money.

&gt;Not enough people are thinking about fully-automated AI R&amp;D.

https://x.com/McaleerStephen/status/1874191509198954678

&gt;In AlphaGo, just training on human data only got to amateur level. But once they cracked high-compute RL, then superintelligence was inevitable.

If he has true knowledge of such things, perhaps they allow it as part of their wish to inform the public.  
If he doesn't have true knowledge, but it also happens to be true, I assume they are fine with him reporting on rumours and the general vibe at OpenAI.  
If he doesn't have true knowledge and it happens not to be true, perhaps they are happy to have the hype.  
  
Either way, it's interesting that such posts are allowed.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Most of the agents being deployed to do this will likely just cancel each other out tho in reality. It’s like if you gave every single NBA team a jump-shooter as good as Steph Curry. Or if you could magically give every NFL team a quarterback as good as Tom Brady. They won’t all magically become championship dynasties. In reality, The quarterbacks/jump-shooters will just all cancel each other out. Meaning that no one benefits from them. The same would happen if tons of people had a “make me money on the internet” agent.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Absolutely. Let's put aside the cost argument, which is incredibly in favor of AI.

When a patient is about to undergo surgery, and an AI has a greater proven success record VS the human surgeons on staff, the hospital is opening itself up to legal liability if they go with the human.  Humanity will look back at this time period and be horrified that we allowed other humans so much control over our bodies, that we allowed them to drive several tons of steel 80mph down the highway, and so on.

This will seem like such a barbaric age.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">So liability laws don't necessarily work that way.  The hospital might or might not be liable since human medical boards decide what the standard of care is.


I think there will be a transition period where competing hospital networks or clinics located in more permissive countries are offering medicals services, using 90 percent AI with human doctors to oversee.


And there will be this big misinformation campaign by current hospitals.  Every time a patient dies at one of these clinics it will be headline news.  (Never mind right from the start the death and mortality rates will likely be way lower and steadily drop as the AIs learn from all their mistakes and get underlying intelligence boosts from version updates)


Deniers will say the way lower death rates are cherry picked or misleading.  


Eventually of course it will be an avalanche as suddenly the narrative flips and current hospital have mass layoffs and restructuring and adopt the same tech.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">When it can be quantifiably demonstrated that AI delivers better health outcomes then there will be a moral imperative to use the technology for everyone.

Likewise, if self-driving cars are demonstrated to be safer than human drivers then there is a strong incentive to promote the use of the technology, initially through lower insurance premiums and ultimately through regulations.

A jury of peers and judges can be fallible and subject to biases - eg. there is analysis that shows better outcomes for verdicts when happening after a meal break - the so-called [Hungry judge effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_judge_effect#:~:text=The%20hungry%20judge%20effect%20is,on%20economic%20and%20social%20behavior.)

It would be fascinating to feed all evidence and court transcripts and/or audio for historical cases into a model with large enough context to see what conclusions the model arrives at and compare it to the actual verdicts.

Replacing or even supplementing juries or judges with AI will obviously require changes in the law and is not likely to happen any time soon, especially whilst models suffer from hallucinations and their own biases.</div>

Every time I hear from someone that ASI will be here soonish, but it's still going to be decades to see progress in some fields, it snaps a circuit breaker in my head. 


Either they can't comprehend what ASI actually means, or they are lying. 


If he really believes ASI is coming in a year or so, he should be saying 'then ASI will solve this and that for us faster than we ever could". There should be no more long horizon beyond physical building time. 


Or am I being grandiose??

                        <div class="comment-body">I used to guide nighttime snowmobile tours in SW Colorado.  The shock and awe of people who had never really seen the night sky was the best part of the job. We would stop, way in the mountains,  kill the lights, and on cloudless nights it was absolutely brilliant There is a good portion of society that has no clue what's up there. My current favorite thing is to go to the SE Utah desert at night and lay there with a set of binoculars. There is an amazing amount of movement up there, mostly satellites,  meteors etc. but once in a while something different will show up, fascinating!</div>

I had never before, and have never again, seen the night sky in such resplendent beauty. The city dwellers (such as myself) usually have no idea what theyre missing.... 

The time I speak of, I was SO excited, and i tried to point it out to my family... I could scarcely get them to even look up!!! I still don't understand how they werent as excited as I was, to this day. 

And yes, laying on the ground and looking straight up, and being absolutely still, you will see things far, far, far up in the sky which are certainly not satellites, nor airplanes..... I have seen lights so dim they could barely be perceived, zig zagging and arcing lazily across the sky. Changing direction. Most people have probably never even been in a dark enough place to try such a thing. But they're there. And its not bokeh, or a high altitude seagull illuminated by spotlights, nor high altitude bats illuminated by the sun over the horizon, nor chinese lanterns, nor solar balloons, nor mylar children's birthday party escapees..... Its like OP says, all you gotta do is look up and wait.</div>

I also did that but looking back realize a weird thing happened and I dismissed it because I had no explanation that fit. Examples... on the way back from a wedding at 11:00 at night, 4 people in the car, 2 flashes of light about 1 minute apart. This was the most pure, white light we had ever seen, unbelievably bright. There were no storms in the area, no rain, it was the hilly Finger Lakes area and lit the hills around for miles. It was not lightening... We were staying at North Myrtle Beach, folks at the Apache camp ground near the pier reported seeing a flaming object fall into the ocean at around midnight. Helicopters were called out to search, a zodiac was stationed on the beach, nothing was found , no debris, no oil slick, no plane reported missing. Years later I read people seeing USO's often think they see a flaming plane crash in to the ocean and now I wonder what that was. They see it but dismiss it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I actually had a crazy time camping recently with my family. Stayed up exclusively to see if anything would come along. Sure enough, a light starts tracking across the sky, fading in and out irregularly. Soon after, two satellites crossed near each other, followed by another ten or eleven. As i watched the last one, as it was coming over me, it shot to one side and streaked out in an arc. At least, that's what i saw. I thought it was probably starlink, but the launch was out by a day, I think. Could be i have my timezones mixed up. Following that, there were just tons of satellites (no surprise there) and occasional flashes in sections of the sky. 

I was pretty happy I stayed up for it.

Edit: I've just checked the metadata of my videos of this event (the night videos are awful, but i might try to see if i can retrieve anything interesting) against the starlink launch schedule, and it's five days after the last launch, so out of the question for what I saw. Is there anything else that deploys multiple satellites like starlink?</div>

With one fairly unspectacular exception that occurred while pulled over on the side of a freeway, I've never ever seen anything unusual in the sense of possibly being an anomalous ufo.


 I really really do not believe genuinely anomalous ufo activity is common at all. And I've come to that conclusion from more than just my subjective personal experiences but also from following the ufo topic for a few decades. I think it's extremely rare. </div>

It even feels like people constantly go on about observables, but every video that gets posted shows movement or characteristics that can be fairly easily explained by advanced human technology, or dismissed as footage that has been tampered with.

I think the truth is probably right around the middle somewhere; UAP are not everywhere and some of us are just unlucky geographically, but in the places that they are active, there are areas that would be considered "hot spots" and have common UAP activity.</div>

I'm sure it describes them if you click, but honestly I won't bother. 

It's not just JRE, so much online media has become so flooded with adds that it's like they forgot why we all abandoned TV. They have made consuming their stuff sufficiently annoying that I now simply use Youtube and now...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's not so much the ads that bother me, because at this point the internet is just one big ad. It's the point that Rogan before said how ridiculous it is that podcasters would just throw them into the middle of the conversation and completely ruin the flow and that's exactly what happens now. It made sense when he had all the ads at the beginning.

Also Matt and Shane's Secret Podcast is my favorite podcast and they said at the beginning they wouldn't have ads because "no god's, no masters". Then they realized how much money they were leaving on the table and changed their tune. It is what it is nowadays unfortunately. When they figure out the technology for unskippable ads is when we have a real problem.</div>

Btw, i don’t think Joe Rogan, or any other major podcaster, really is out to flood ads to their followers to make their fans unhappy, if that’s what you’re saying. 

If you had millions of followers, wouldn’t you use the opportunity to make some money for your time? What’s the issue? Traditional media has been doing it for decades. Arguably with advertising that’s destructive. What kind of gripe do you really have with Joe Rogan and AG1?

You can’t literally go through YouTube without running into multiple ads, without paying for premium. What’s your point?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’ve been up for an hour so far today (winter hours, alarm set for 6:50 and I usually beat it by a few minutes). I’ve eaten a light breakfast, had my first coffee, and I think you can all guess what stage of the routine I’m at right now. Soon I’ll shave, wash my face in cool water, run some water through my hair to flatten out the cowlicks from sleeping, and despite working from home today, I’ll put jeans and a sweater on (I like to get dressed even if I’m home. Helps compartmentalize). Might sneak in some light stretching before I change. I lifted and worked core yesterday so I could maybe use some yoga poses. 

I’ll boot up the laptop 15 mins before my first meeting of the day, run through my notes real quick, and then I’m off. 

So all told, today is about 1h30m of me time before I get to work. If I were going to the office, 20m of that would be for the commute and I’d arrive with 5m to spare before the meeting vs 15m. 

Since I’m home today, I’ll probably bundle up and walk a few miles in 20 degree weather during lunch before my protein shake.</div>

If narrow AI achieves superhuman abilities in areas like maths and programming, it could drive major advancements in AI hardware and architectures. This includes alternatives to GPUs/TPUs like neuromorphic chips, artificial neural networks transitioning to spiking neural networks, and transformers evolving into spiking transformers as possible examples. These (or similar) innovations could lead to AI systems with large, scalable memories that generalise, adapt, and learn efficiently. In this sense, narrow AI could be the path to AGI.

Where’s the flaw in this logic?</div>

                <div class="post-content">When the recipe calls for browning the meat, especially beef, that means let it sit in a hot pan until til it’s nice and caramelized on a side, the keep on dicing it up with that wooden spoon in your hand and repeat. 

But. Let. It. Sit. 

Don’t move it every 30 seconds. The recipe says brown the meat, not grey it. I promise, for 99% of dishes the meat will be finished in the final phase of cooking.   

Soooo much more flavor, and less actual work. </div>

I taught my bf how to make spaghetti sauce and other meat dishes, but even though he follows my recipe it never turns out the same for him. After watching him in the kitchen a few times I've come to realize it's because he doesn't let the meat brown. He can't stand to not stir it almost constantly and was using a much lower heat than I would. I think he's scared of burning it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Woohoo, came to make this comment but you beat me to it. Never crowd the pan if you want things to brown or reduce. Surface area is your friend.

What a lot of people don't realize is that browning (the Maillard reaction) happens as sugars are reduced and moisture content goes down. Moisture content goes down because you're boiling off the moisture at high temperatures. BUT boiling isn't simply a more heat/more boil equation. If it's steaming, that's water leaving the food. Adding more heat won't make that happen faster, it's just more likely to burn the stuff that does dehydrate and start to brown.  The only way to get it to dehydrate faster is to increase the surface area, spread it out and not overcrowd. An even layer of whatever it is without being too tight is what's wanted. 

If you think of it more like the water leaving is the bottleneck, then it makes a lot more sense.</div>

I always wondered why sometimes my meat would brown beautifully, and sometimes it just produced a lot of liquid and steamed itself.

A hot pan that's not overcrowded, and voilà, nicely browned meat.</div>

And they couldn't say shit because our output and numbers spoke for themselves. All these years of knowing this was maddening. It took COVID for these idiots to see.</div>

I was in VT when the lockdown was announced and places shut down.  Mountains, restaurants, etc.  As per my usual habit when I headed home, I stopped off at the local market for a sandwich for the drive, and two 4-packs of Heady Topper to take home.  This market is not large by VT standards, and quite small compared to markets in cities.

And there was this guy leaving with a shopping cart filled with TP and meat.  My wife, who was waiting in the car, noted that his license plates were from MA.  He was likely driving through multiple cities on his way home, and chose to nearly wipe out the inventory of a small town market.</div>
