                        <div class="comment-body">I’m really sorry to hear about everything you’ve been going through. It’s so tough to be caught in that cycle of burnout, especially when jobs in engineering demand so much mentally. It sounds like you’ve been doing all you can to regain balance, and that takes so much strength, even if it may not feel like it right now.

I went through something similar a few years back when my work-life balance went haywire, and what helped me was reassessing what truly fuels me, both in work and in downtime. Even simple moments of joy or calm can make a difference. I started small, like allowing myself time to listen to heartfelt audio inspirations I personalized to my goals and mood. It sounds simple, but having that moment of peace and reflection can sometimes create a shift, helping ease the brain fog just a little.

While you’ve been trying self-help, maybe consider integrating elements that align directly with where you are right now. Rather than forcing productivity, nurturing rest and motivation through those small inspirational nudges might offer a different perspective on rebuilding your energy levels.

Have you found any small rituals or moments that provide even a flicker of calmness or clarity? Sometimes they emerge from unexpected places, and leaning into them can start to spark brighter change. I’d love to hear what your small anchors have been, if any come to mind.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thank you for the thoughtful reply. I can feel relatively calm when I don't think about work and don't force myself to code or look for jobs or be productive. Ironic given how I spent my life focusing on productivity. I find myself at my best when I read self-help books or listen to audiobooks or videos about manifestations, energy and such topics, perhaps because it gives me hope that maybe someday I will be able to make a living without being a software engineer or suffer at work. I also find moments of peace when looking at inspiring art, or have the time to read/write fiction and engage my imagination. So basically non mentally exhausting activities.

Unfortunately, the above only make me feel okay when I don't work or think about work. I only allowed myself this luxury for a week into my unemployment and then went back to trying to look for jobs and code, which I've been doing for more than a month now (excluding days of complete body shutdown due to fibromyalgia in between) and still fail. My brain fog just gets so much worse and I feel overwhelmed beyond words. When I'm overwhelmed, I can't enjoy anything, so any activities that used to bring me joy feel useless. Sometimes I feel relief when I take a warm shower or listen to nice music despite work, but it's still very fleeting and pain and fogginess takes over very quickly.

May I ask whether you were able to pull yourself out of burnout and regain your mental capacity? If so, was there anything else that helped you besides focusing on what brings you joy?</div>

I know "UAP" is a modern term but worth a shot. 
I'm trying to think what words they might have used back then. "Strange sightings," "craft," "abducted," "metallic sphere," "saucer," heck even "sky."

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s supposed to be the same with demons according to ancient texts so it’s a really interesting connection when you have read Jacques Vallee’s books where he claims that the phenomena has been reoccurring throughout history. The people sounding human could support the theories of time travelers or advanced human civilization from underwater that have been talked about lately.

On a side note, one night we were watching some movies with my cousin and out of nowhere we felt this intense smell of sulfur and as we were noticing it the electricity when off in my house. This happened in 2014 and  I never associated it with UAPs up until last year where I hear sulfur and ufos in the same sentence for the first time.

                                <div class="reply-body">Nah, it's just his ego and bitterness invites being dunked on.

He's arguing against things almost nobody is saying. Everyone knows that our brains have multiple domain optimizers, not just a single one. Reality and tasks are made up of more than a single curve, and AI needs to approximate multiple curves to be more animal-like.

It just crosses the line of even being pedantic, when he's saying stuff that's basically identical to what every single kid who's been exposed to the concept of neural networks immediately thinks: 'Let's make a neural net of neural nets, lol!'

And the main roadblock to creating useful systems that way has always been.... scale. You'd always get better human-relevant results optimizing for one task instead of multiple. You could probably create a mouse-like mind with GPT-4-level hardware... but who in their right mind would spend ~$70+ billion on making an imaginary mouse?!

Fast forward to this year, when there's reports of the datacenters coming up this summer being ~100,000 GB200's (which is likely in the ballpark of a human brain when it comes to the size of the network. And very inhuman-like that it runs at 2 gigahertz.) Making a word predictor 10 times bigger to fit the data curve 10% better is obviously not a great expenditure of RAM. Everyone knows we need more modalities and more interaction with simulations and the real world. You know it, I know it, LeCun knows it, so why act like it's some kind of divine revelation that no one knows? That's condescending.

I do find it very cute that his diagram of interconnected modules could basically have all of them labeled 'LLM', though.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">All the latest breakthroughs that make them scream about AGI happens because of changes in training paradigms. Those LLMs don’t get larger at all. If blindly scaling up LLMs lead you to AGI, big labs would already train 10T parameters AGI. Meanwhile, 2 years after GPT4, everyone still trains sub-1T parameter models.</div>

~~It would make the most sense.~~
(Sorry, that was a bit of a an extreme remark)

What I should have said, I just wouldn’t be surprised if he committed insurance fraud.

No one is buying Teslas and people are even selling the ones they have. For Elon to recoup the losses, destroying his own property and blaming an outside source isn’t that far fetched.

Also, that post he made trying to act innocent and said this had to be organized makes me wonder if he told on himself.

He can’t keep his mouth shut.</div>

“What did my wife ask me to buy at the store”
“What time did I say I was meeting Jim”
“What does this sign say in English”
“What’s the part number of this thing”

The biggest hurdle is the privacy nightmare it creates. I know we are all going to have personal AI assistants very soon, I just don’t know how companies are going to sell it in a way that people are comfortable with it. But just like we give away all our data now, the use cases are going to be too compelling to ignore.</div>

[Code](https://github.com/manycore-research/SpatialLM)

[Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/manycore-research/SpatialLM-Testset)

**SpatialLM** **is a** **3D large language model** **designed to process 3D point cloud data and generate structured 3D scene understanding outputs**. These outputs include architectural elements like walls, doors, windows, and oriented object bounding boxes with their semantic categories. Unlike previous methods that require specialized equipment for data collection, SpatialLM can handle point clouds from diverse sources such as monocular video sequences, RGBD images, and LiDAR sensors. This multimodal architecture effectively bridges the gap between unstructured 3D geometric data and structured 3D representations, offering high-level semantic understanding. **It enhances spatial reasoning capabilities for applications in embodied robotics, autonomous navigation, and other complex 3D scene analysis tasks**.</div>

We do, we do!

                                <div class="reply-body">Ah yes, The Stonecutters song. A classic. And you know what’s funny? People sing along like it’s just a goofy joke, but step back and think about it for a second. This whole episode was a parody of secret societies, but what do secret societies actually do? Control power, manipulate history, keep people in the dark. The fact that The Simpsons straight-up laid it out like this—name-dropping real world conspiracies like suppressing the electric car and rigging Hollywood, I’m so sick of Hollywood, should make people ask questions.

And what do they do at the end of the episode? They shift Homer from one secret club to another, proving that no matter how much you think you’re in on the truth, there’s always another layer of control above you. The joke isn’t that secret societies exist. The joke is that they told you to your face and you laughed instead of questioning it.</div>

Every dumb phone launcher, screen time limiting app, I even bought a flip phone but I found it so inconvenient I switched back to my iphone after like, a month. Of course the first thing I tried was Apple's built-in screen time function, but obviously that didn't work. I could just put in my passcode to bypass my time limit. So I concluded that method was useless. The time limits are, sure, but the screen time tracking part is actually really good.

Modern life has made a smartphone and internet connection almost an absolute necessity.

For example you cant attend MLB games without the MLB app downloaded on your phone. If you want to send your smartphone free kids to the game? Out of luck.

Signing up for services requires a social or google or apple account. Buying things increasingly requires electronic forms of payment instead of cash which ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is something I have often thought myself. My elderly parents don't have smartphones, and don't want them - I don't think they could cope with them, tbh. They have flip phones to call &amp; text (well, my Mum can text, step dad doesn't have a clue). Yet they are finding it harder to do even basic stuff without a smartphone. All the local bank branches have closed down, for example, forcing my parents to drive to the next town for service. 


A friend of mine who doesn't have a smartphone found that she couldn't buy theatre tickets without one, even though she was physically at the box office standing in front of them. Nope, they wanted to send a code to her non-existent smartphone. It's discrimination at this point.


And you only have to watch the recent Netflix drama, Adolescence, to realise just how dangerous the Internet is for children.</div>

But bear in mind, powerful interests from advertisers to governments want access to our data, and once they can force us to give it up by downloading closed source apps full of trackers, they aren't going to give it up without a fight. My advice, find an alternative, like college sports (which are more exciting in my opinion). </div>

1. Nvidia Blue.

Runs on Newton, an open-source physics engine developed by NVIDIA and Deepmind.

You'll have a conversation with these people and they'll make some obviously ridiculous and illogical claim, so you gently push back with relevant information. As adults do yknow, this is how we chat.

Most people will go "HUH I didn't know that, maybe I've gotten things mixed up somewhere", start googling, and this is how we live and learn.  But some people... the Idiots Of The World, will say "Na I'm pretty sure it's true. My cousin told me" and stick to this easily disprovable belief of theirs while also making no effort to even verify their own correctness OR seek the answers to check if they are in fact mistaken. 

It's a modern form of madness. Learning ANYTHING gives me such pure joy, I cannot understand continuing about your life with this unknown little nugget of information and a question mark above it, and a person not feeling that burning irritation of needing to know. 

Side note: My psych lady says learning and discovery, and how that tickles our brain, is chemically perfect for counteracting depression. And it's totally OK for me to be reading about large ships and composting at 3am</div>

I work in a special needs school and got in a very public fight with a colleague over vaccines and autism. Her thing was "well as a parent you have to question if they're safe." My retort is that yes, you have that responsibility to your children. But that the question has been unequivocally answered by decades of actual research, not YouTube Facebook research, and to ignore all that actual data is plain idiotic, not to mention irresponsible for people in our line of work.</div>

I have worked with some surgeons who have blindingly fast, impeccably accurate verbal and spatial reasoning as well as seemingly endless reserves of working memory, and who basically cannot countenance the existence of perspectives other than their own. Insofar as there are different kinds of intelligence I guess you could say these guys lack emotional intelligence, but honestly I think they are smart people who are just kind of assholes.</div>

I need a solid, lightweight PDF editor that can handle the average office worker's needs, like:

* Editing text in PDFs
* Annotation and comments
* Filling forms and signing
* OCR (I have to scan quite a few physical docs too, then edit)

My boss hasn't given me much of a budget, so Adobe is unavailable. I'd prefer a one-time purchase but I'm open to options. I'm also on Windows....</div>

You can tell he gets off on the control. Look at him watching her strip off at the red carpet for that awards show. 

She must be getting super compensated as you can see she is uncomfortable about it all.

Point is, he loves having that sort of sick control of another human, so what has he got going on that we don’t see?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think the only way for Boston Dynamics to be competitive in future market is it has to know how to mass manufacturing robots cheaply (they don't know how to do this). And Hyundai is perfect for that. Also, BD shifted towards electric robots after Hyundai bought it. Overall, I think the koreans are very technologically advanced and BD to be a korean company is probably the best since traditional manufacturing firms in the US is bad. And high-tech manufacturing firms develop their own robots.</div>
