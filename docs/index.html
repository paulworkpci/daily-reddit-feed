More excited for memory related breakthroughs than I was before. If Claude could remember more than 3 minutes of gameplay at once maybe it could start to deduce why it's stuck, but it doesn't even realise it is stuck currently.</div>

If they can’t train on something and see tons of examples, then they don’t perform well. The sota AI system right now couldn’t pick up a new video game and play it as well as an average 7 year old because they can’t learn like a 7 year old can. They just brute force because they are still basically a moron in a box. Just a really fast moron with limitless drive.</div>

I hate this assertion because it's inaccurate in all various ways. They didn't have the horsepower of a cat brain, and they certainly don't have the faculties of a cat.

The systems he was talking about are essentially a squirrel's brain that **ONLY** predicts words in reaction to a stimulus.

We all kind of assume if you scale that around 20x with many additional faculties, you could get to a proto-AGI that can start to really replace human feedback in training runs.

I personally believe it was feasible to create something mouse-like with GPT-4 sized datacenters.... but who in their right mind was going to spend $500,000,000,000 for *that*?! I'd love to live in the kind of world where some mad capitalist would invest into having a pet virtual mouse that can't do anything besides run around and poop inside an imaginary space - if we lived in such a world it'd already have been a paradise before we were even born - but it was quite unrealistic in the grimdark cyberpunk reality we actually have to live in..</div>

Here is an ai vtuber beating slay the spire https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FvTdoCpPskE&amp;pp=ygUZZXZpbCBuZXVybyBzbGF5IHRoZSBzcGlyZQ%3D%3D

The problem here is the lack of memory. If it had gemini’s context window, it would definitely do far better

Also, i like how the same people who say llms need millions of examples to learn something also say that llms can only regurgitate data theyve seen already even when they do well on the gpqa. Where exactly did they get millions of examples of phd level, google proof questions lol</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Heres the thing: people that need to send that message the most participate in an “economic blackout” almost every day.

5 minutes after: “Look at the performance on these benchmarks. This is AGI.”

3 days later: “It’s a great model, but it still has some of the same old issues with x, y, and z.”

1 week later: “4.5 was a big disappointment. When is 5.0 coming? That one will be AGI.”</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The Attorney General’s authority stems from federal law, specifically Title 28 of the U.S. Code, Section 533, which empowers the AG to appoint officials to detect and prosecute crimes against the United States, a role that includes overseeing the FBI’s activities. Additionally, the FBI’s operations are governed by guidelines and policies set by the Attorney General, and the agency is required to report its findings and activities to the AG and U.S. Attorneys across the country. This hierarchical relationship means that the AG can direct the FBI to provide information, such as documents, related to its investigations, assuming the request falls within the scope of lawful oversight and doesn’t infringe on specific legal protections (like classified information requiring additional clearance or processes).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The reality is the Epstein files are like nuclear bombs. Trump is never going to release them because people close to him (or he himself) are on it. His enemies won’t release it because they’re on it. Even if he tried to selectively release them just on Democrats, they don’t know what would be leaked in return. 

Rogan shut up about the Epstein files real quick as soon as Trump for in. Even though Trump was the one that let the officers off that “fell asleep” and there was no footage of the suicide. For some reason these clowns think it’s some Democrat only thing. They’ll make a big show of this, say the “Democrats” deleted everything before they left office, and call it a day.</div>

I'm not entirely sure why, but I had especially adversarial relationships with both of my teachers. 

Despite that, I did well and the lessons learned have served me in more walks of life than I can accurately list at the moment.

Strongly agree with the OP. And for those worried about nerves: EMBRACE THEM! A large percentage of successful public speaking is realizing the nerves are controllable, you just need experience overcoming them.

...a lot of the rest is about dealing with pregnant pauses.</div>

The improvement in hallucination rate is notable. Not sure if this is because the model is simply larger, and therefore contains more facts, vs material improvements.</div>

I’m in the camp that is skeptical of near term AGI, but ironically am very impressed here while some of the top comments atm seem to think it’s a disappointment 🤷‍♂️</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">No offense but I’m guessing you’re not literally doing nothing all day from the moment you wake up you just stare at a wall and suddenly it’s nighttime again. I’m going to guess you’re on your phone, in which case you need to do something drastic like give your phone to your parents at night and tell them not to give it back to you until you’ve done your workout. Alternatively you can ask them to buy you a lock box and lock your phone away on a timer where it won’t open until like 5pm (this is assuming it’s a weekend of course) or put your phone in the garage or laundry room or under the sink, just somewhere you don’t associate with your phone normally being. Then only give yourself permission to just lay in bed or on the couch and actually do literally nothing. Just relax. Relax so much you get bored. Get so bored that now you will let yourself do literally anything as long as it doesn’t have a screen to stop this boredom. It can be as simple shooting papers into a basket, or looking outside a window, or anything that’s just super not overwhelming. Once you get bored of that ask yourself if you’d like to go back to laying on the couch. If yes then do it, and repeat, if no then look for something slightly more stimulating like sitting on your front porch or backyard, or something weird like how many of your hand widths from one side of the room to the other, and keep doing this building little by little (I can write more if you’d like help but I don’t want to be too verbose about it if you get the idea already), until you’re working out. You may not end up working out the first day you do this, or you might, but do this enough times and you’ll start to wake up knowing exactly what you do want to do and you’ll do it (but keep leaving your phone in the laundry room or at the back of your closet or something until the set time you are now okay with you having it again).

The main problem you need to solve is getting yourself to be mentally calm without your phone, then it’s much easier to develop discipline in other areas as the easy dopamine fix isn’t there anymore so you will learn to get it from other places like working out or finishing your school work or whatever you want to do that’s not be on your phone.

                        <div class="comment-body">Firstly, you're 16. Your brain is not even close to being developed. And I would caution against 'getting tested for ADHD'. That's not really how it works. I would suggest more going to a psychologist and talking about the way you feel without trying to label it necessarily.

Don't worry though, I was way worse when I was 16. You're going to do fine :) We're all figuring this out.</div>

The Solution is simple.

You are trying to do TOO MUCH at once and when u dont complete ur task u feel bad / worse and try to do even more for the time u have wasted.

Start with 5 Push Ups and FEEL as if u accomplished something. Slowly it will progressively overload just keep consistent with low intensity.

You will FEEL more likely to do the work ur avoiding... 

Small wins accumulate.

Also when u have the feeling of a "winner" u WANT to do more than 5 push ups and do like 20 , 50 or 100 or whatever... but keep the bare minimum consistent</div>

This is Orion lol. A very incremental improvement that opens up no new possibilities.

Keep this in mind when you hear future whispers of amazing things they have behind closed doors that are too dangerous to announce.</div>

Models don’t necessarily need to get significantly smarter if they have pinpoint accuracy to their dataset and understand how to manage it across domains.  

This might not be it, but there may be a use we haven’t identified that could significantly increase the value of this type of model.</div>

Hmm, I'm on the plus tier, but not in any rush, so a week's wait is no big deal for me personally.

I'm mostly interested in accuracy on scientific questions, so OpenAI's introduction page [https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-5/](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-5/) doesn't look too hopeful. In the appendix, the scores they show for GPQA(science) show 4.5 at 71.4% while o3-mini(high) was better, at 79.7%  Ouch</div>

I feel like the recent over dramatization of the egg video and the Jake Barber story is doing more harm than good for the UFO community. At least some people are losing hope with this new shift toward woo-woo rather than focusing on the actual physical evidence that is claimed to be hidden from us. Maybe there is some woo-woo aspect to it, but if we need public trust, then we need to focus on the nuts-and-bolts side of things. David Grusch said he knows where the crafts and bodies are; there have been many incidents where they had near collisions with flights, etc. I think this phenomenon needs to be explored first using the available data rather than by making up supernatural theories and extraordinary claims. That can all be done once we see the craft at hand, in my opinion.

  
With Ramamoorthi's appointment to the new task force, I think we can be hopeful that the right questions will be asked.

                <div class="post-content">i've tried everything, but i just end up back in bed, falling asleep for another hour or two. 

i've tried putting my phone far away from my bed, but i just end up sprinting across the cold room to turn off the stupid thing, and then i'm back in my cozy warm bed. i try to actually wake up, but i'm passed out in what feels like a few seconds.

any other tips? i've heard of people getting a sunrise alarm clock, which seems super cool! but i can't really afford something like that at the moment.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">One trick that works for a lot of people is forcing movement before your brain can argue. As soon as you turn off your alarm, instead of climbing back in bed, do something slightly active—stretch, drink a glass of water, or even just sit on the floor for a minute. The shock of getting out of bed makes it harder to slip back in.

Another thing that might help is giving your body a reason to wake up. If your room is freezing, keep a cozy robe nearby so getting up isn’t miserable. If you like coffee or tea, set it up the night before so all you have to do is hit a button. Small incentives can trick your brain into wanting to stay up.

Also, do you tend to fall back asleep because you're still too tired? If so, your sleep quality might need tweaking—like adjusting bedtime, light exposure, or even hydration before bed.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Ok first: give yourself grace. You need to understand that this whole situation? It's not an accident. It's not a failure of your willpower. The people who design these phones and apps know a lot more about how human brains work than you do, and they use that to make sure they make money off your attentionb and they make it *hard* to quit. 


So. You are gonna need to start by finding something that soothes you that is not your phone. I'm gonna go old school here and say food, masturbation, or meditation. Exercise is good too. 


Then you are going to need to practice. Don't go cold turkey if that's failing. Set a schedule, and start small. Fifteen minutes. Then twenty. Then half an hour. Time yourself. Track your anxiety. If it spikes, stop increasing until you feel more confident that you have your anxiety under control. 


Start researching anxiety... Offline. Go to a library and look at a physical book. It will be slow, and inefficient, and weird, but it will be an experience. 


It took time to get here, it will take time to leave, but you can do this. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">we are all living the same life. i can’t stand a minute without some kind of noise in the background, going with my phone everywhere.

also, i deleted my social media apps like instagram, but anyway, I am always listening to something on youtube. so idk. 

i had a dumb phone in my recent past for a year and it was the best. i was present, not afraid of staying alone with my thoughts and more in creative mood. constantly consuming is draining af.

for me having the burner phone its the only solution, since i feel like don’t have a willpower (right now) to limit myself..but also I don’t have the balls to switch since everything and everyone is online now</div>

I am an 28 year old man and the internet and phones are literally ruining my life and potential although I cannot stop. I graduated with highest distinction and honors from university  and had very bright career prospects (when I was still able to work really hard towards my goals), but especially in the past few years I have fallen into a very deep depression.
