The excuses I tend to give myself are that I’ve got nothing going on in my life right now, unable to  leave the house alone at times due to my health, and even just the act of being in my house makes me loose any motivation most days. So I‘ll feel like if I don’t follow my regular schedule of staring at my phone and the TV or playing video games all day, I’ll be super bored.

I think it's important to recognise that short term pleasure isn't the same as long term happiness, and it's easy to confused the two when you're stuck in a cycle of dopamine addiction. 


What I'd recommend is spend some time with your boredom, maybe with a notebook and just let your mind wander. Note down things that are interesting or you notice.


Think about the things that you enjoy. It doesn't matter if its good and bad things, just jot them down, make a list. Can be anything simple or complex. You might notice some patterns of things that come up a lot, or things you could work on getting more of.</div>

That's enough to get better than 90% people at something or at least acquire a handful of useful skills. To think of it using the time value of money,  assuming you make $20 an hour, 1000 hours a year wasted is $20k down the drain. That's a house downpayment in 2-3 years. That is not accounting for the absolute detrimental effects on your health blue light has, and don't even get me started on things like mental health, attention span and mood. A $1200 phone would never offset that. 

Don't think about wasting your money, think about wasting your life. You have decades to work, but you are unable to buy even 1 second of your life back.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">When this fully happens either:

1. The Internet is killed as we know it. Only just for watching mainstream media (Netflix, HBO), some websites that provide information and no social networks. There is no point in being on a social network if I know every post could be AI. Also the mainstream media should identify the accounts as well.

2. The Internet is kept in small communities where you know everyone is human (like a Discord server with your friends). But it is impossible to meet real people on the internet.

3. Full verification is required for the internet (aka. you should be identified) destroying internet privacy, anonymity and killing the internet again.

4. Governments impose heavy laws against botting, like running a farm of harmful bots will be punished by law. Least bad scenario but hard to enforce.</div>

This means the new kid on the AI block failed to stop a single harmful prompt.

I don't see this as anything other than a win.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; The dark truth is that some threats are much easier to create than destroy.

A lot of people don't get this. In most scenarios, defense is way harder than offense. There are only a few exceptions, notably in small arms firefights where the people who can stay inside, waiting for attackers to come in, have a huge tactical advantage. But in most other scenarios, defense is super hard.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You have accelerationists thinking we will collectively pool our personal AI's and that will somehow lead to biosafety. Everyone having more intelligence tips the offense defense asymmetry in favor of defense for some reason, when pressed they can't specify how. Sounds like a lot of wishful thinking from people who have not fully considered the situation we are going to be in.

What seems to be the logical outcome is, if everyone has an offline, no limits tutor, the only path to safety is giving up all privacy. Everyone under constant surveillance at all times.</div>

&gt; "The white liberal differs from the white conservative only in one way: the liberal is more deceitful than the conservative. The liberal is more hypocritical than the conservative. Both want power, but the white liberal is the one who has perfected the art of posing as the Negro's friend and benefactor; and by winning the friendship, allegiance, and support of the Negro, the white liberal is able to use the Negro as a pawn or tool in this political 'football game' that is constantly raging between the white liberals and white conservatives."

He was killed a few months after making that statement.</div>

As he aged he saw the oppression exhibited by his religion, white liberals in particular, and how the media fed into it.  Once he made his pilgrimage and saw that there were white Muslims he couldn't believe how long he had been brainwashed by the American power establishment.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I have been off of social media, aside reddit, for a while. Decided to dip my toe back into it with bluesky; I lasted less than 3 days on it. I really enjoy connecting with fellow geeks in my field and staying up to date and sharing etc... but I realized I just cannot deal with social media as-is right now. I wasted at least 2hrs in the past two days on that app following people and setting it up; it felt like a massive waste of time and stress elevator. My work has been going very well, I love ...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It is. The whole user interface and hivemind immediately activated this "I should be engaging and cannot just do minimal engagement if not anonymous" -- selecting followers, not only for their feeds but "because I should follow them" -- this is just how my mindset automatically moved on it. 


I don't have major issues with envy. My irl life is pretty darn good and I LOVE geeking tf out coding and data modeling and sharing this and looking at and learning from others; I don't feel less from their posts and actually love this part of social media -- but despite all of this, it just felt like a massive brain tax to even get on it. My self awareness, and having been away from not anonymous platforms, made me very aware of its emotional impact and the less than helpful though and emotional pathways it triggered in me.


I wish there was a healthier way for me to engage with what's there or a healthier modality for engagement if enough others feel this way.


Less than 72hrs in; deleted. I even felt a tiny nagging pressure I did when I deleted my Twitter and fb and such back in the day of "oh no! How will I stay connected!!" And reminding that I have for years, with messaging and my own website and email; I don't need another platform. Further, if it's meant to be it will happen; amazing things keep happening in my life, awesome connections, and if the last few years have taught me anything it's that by not having such social media I can focus more on the DOING and the collaboration comes naturally and without using those platforms there's a lot less BS and predatory shallow people to sift through.</div>

You have to read the twitter thread but it also bans the "export" which means all open source projects would have to either implement some sort of verification mechanism (how?) or just kind of stop being open source. Because if you do anything that could fall under the vague rubric of "export" then you're looking at literal prison time.

The text of the bill seems horrendous even by the most chuddish standards. As in it's not even a matter of whether or not you want to be tough on China because the bill is just poorly written.

I am a little worried for this post if people won't understand how it relates to UAP, so to be clear: serious and qualified people think consciousness may be fundamental to physics instead of emergent from brains or other complex systems, which means that there is a clear mechanism for psi phenomena and everything this community refers to as "woo." This relates to everything from praying mantises communicating with telepathy to people referring to craft as sort of alive. If your body is a consciousness vehicle, and if consciousness is not confined to the brain, then one can conceive of constructing a craft to be piloted by consciousness far away from the biological body of the conscious operator.</div>

Our classic understanding of reality is simply wrong, consciousness is out there in the quantum fabric of reality, and our body is simply a machine tapping into one aspect of it.

The problem is our classic science so far has assumed that consciousness is the product of the brain, and this is what masses are familiar with.

Any other model of consciousness is immediately labeled as "woo", because the masses dont know any different.

Could also work in a way that is less scary, for example Kastrup proposes the NLI you're talking about as being the mind in which all nonliving matter subsists, but crucially this divine mind from which we individual minds dissociate during our lives is not self-reflective in the sense of a conscious God who makes judgments and punishes and rewards, but is more like the force of habit of the way things are, the personality of everything. He opens the possibility then upon death our individual minds dissolve back into this divine mind and that perhaps this slowly influences the personality, but his view is totally coherent without any real moral at all, it's just one mind evaporating into many minds which live their lives and then dissolve back, like the ocean and rain.</div>

Eastern philosophies sort of correct this error and suggest our consciousness returns to the source/is part of the source. So our bodies are like little instruments that a bit of the source flows through and "plays" our actions. It impartially learns from all things, good and bad.

This is completely circular logic. 

"If the theory’s right, then it will be accurate and solve the mysteries."

I’m all for speculative theories, it’s just until or unless someone can explain these ideas in plain language and how they relate to UAP/NHI, then I don’t have much use for them. 

They’re in the bucket with all of the other possibilities, as far as I’m concerned. But I’m a nuts and bolts guy (again until or unless I see more compelling information than I’ve seen to date, about the telepathic angle).</div>

Yes, if a new theory explains more of the system, it indeed will be the most accurate theory, this is not really logic or using it as justification, it is just putting forward a speculative fact.

&gt;it will also solve the mysteries around the interpretation of quantum mechanics.

If it's right, perhaps it will. Either way, that statement is not them trying to put an assumption past you, it's just a casual remark.</div>

People in other countries would stop buying from the US, just like how we don't buy BYD electric cars from China, which are of much higher quality and cheaper than Tesla.

The man basically said the Akashic records are real (in other words) and people can access them at will. He said people can affect a computer running a random number generator through their mind only and he said people can summon UAPs through these abilities. 

What's interesting is that he also said he and his colleagues have developed...</div>

The same Monroe Institute that designed the gateway tapes everyone here keeps recommending for those curious about PSI. The same Monroe Institute that's entire mission is studying consciousness.

It's always been about consciousness.

After I had a close encounter with a flying saucer hovering in front of me on broad daylight, I got into the ufo topic.

No one had answers, I didn’t understand this phenomenon. But the books of Robert Monroe changed everything. He changed the life of so many hopeless people. Imagine an out of body experience happens to you randomly, you probably think you get abducted by aliens or whatever, then the fear would start and drive you crazy. Thank god I found about him. And I recommend everyone interested in check out r/astralprojection

I know he can’t read this anymore. But Bob, you are a pioneer and Iam thankful that you walked this path before us, so we can profit from your experiences and follow your steps ❤️</div>

[**The experimental evidence for parapsychological phenomena: A review**](https://thothermes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Cardena.pdf). This peer-reviewed review of parapsychology studies is highly supportive of psi phenomena. In Table 1, they show some statistics.  
  
- For Ganzfeld telepathy studies, p &lt; 1 x 10^-16. That’s about 1 in 10 quadrillion by chance.  
  
- For Daryl Bem’s precognition experiments, p = 1.2 x 10^-10, or about 1 in 10 billion by chance.  
  
- For telepathy evidenced in sleeping subjects, p = 2.72 x 10^-7, or about 1 in 3.6 million by chance.  
  
- For remote viewing (clairvoyance with a protocol) experiments, p = 2.46 x 10-9, or about 1 in 400 million by chance.  
  
- For presentiment (sense of the future), p = 5.7 x 10^-8, or 1 in 17 million by chance.  
  
- For forced-choice experiments, p = 6.3 x 10^-25, or 1 in 1.5 trillion times a trillion.

one of my professors would start teaching class at a whisper rather than shout to get everyone's attention.


eta: comments in this thread discuss when and where this strategy is inappropriate: high risk situations, no buyin among students, and among hearing impaired folks. good teachers read the room though, so they'd know to pull other strategies in those cases.  ✌🏽</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’d say this can be an okay approach in certain circumstances. If it’s a complete stranger. Someone who’s clearly being an asshole. Someone with whom you don’t care to have a further relationship with then it might be an appropriate response 

However if this person is someone close to you, like a friend or a partner. And especially if they feel they have a legitimate reason to be upset, especially if it’s with you, be careful with this approach. Anger is as valid of an emotion as any other in certain circumstances. If you do this too much, especially the part about continuing the conversation as if nothing ever happened, or about viewing them as a toddler. It’s likely to come off as dismissing/invalidating their feelings and can feel very demeaning. If you make the person feel this way it probably will infuriate them further, and no it not help to deescalate the situation (though they are unlikely to understand exactly why in the moment). Do this too frequently in a relationship and it can start to become quite manipulative and controlling especially if it’s used to dodge blame or legitimate responsibility. This can lead to a lot of bad unresolved feelings and resentment, which can sour and ruin a relationship. 

It took me a long time to finally come to realize this as someone who used to do this myself to past parters. Just because we are acting calm or are not showing emotions does not automatically make us the more mature one, the right one, or the adult. In certain cases responding in this way can  be just as immature, or even more immature in terms of communication and conflict resolution as the person who’s having the emotional outburst.

Edit: Cleaned up some grammar, and reworded things to make it read better. Changed “can be a good response” to “can be an okay response” with clarification based on some valid feedback from other commenters.</div>

It teaches you how to talk to and meet the parts of yourself that are sending you those shameful thoughts.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">do you have access to a therapist? at my college, you have free counseling, its included in your tuition! If you are in college, i think that would be a great thing to start looking into and taking advantage of! if you don't have anything like that try going through your insurance to see if they can cover it. talking to someone about these kinds of things is so helpful, it's nice to get it off your chest and feel heard. if therapy isn't something that you have access to, start doing journaling and/or shadow work. shadow work can be more complex than journaling, it really makes you dig deep and embrace the dark parts of you and the light parts of you. I did a bunch of shadow work when I was extremely depressed and it resulted in honestly the best headspace i've ever been in. 

remember failure is apart of life! its what helps you grow and change. it can be scary, but being stuck in the same place (to me) is even scarier. try to just be one percent better everyday, and don't overhaul everything. take it slow. sometimes, you will fail. you will try your hardest at something, and it wont work out. unfortunately thats apart of life. it happens to everyone. my junior year of high school I was so depressed, i couldn't get myself to do anything, and long story short, my grades plummeted. I was looking at not being able to graduate. I took summer courses, didn't take them seriously until the last week and BARELY passed those, im talking if I had one percent lower, I wouldn't have graduated. senior year I worked my ass off, hoping I could get into my dream college, which unfortunately was the only college I got rejected from. I was heartbroken, but I thought I would make do with what I have. I struggled my entire freshman year, and was looking at getting dismissed from the university this semester because of my grades. I was so sick of constantly fucking up my life, and ruining the opportunities I got. I did everything I could to get a diagnosis, get on medication, and better myself. I was scared of failing again, but that fear of failing is what kept me going. sometimes, its hard and terrifying, but you have people to support you don't forget that! all it takes is one habit you correct daily to change your life for the better. try to focus on your successes instead of losses. easier said than done, but it is possible. also know, there will days where you feel like you will go backwards. thats okay. just try to be one percent better the next day. just because you fail doesn't mean its over. You are not dumb or any of the negative things you tell yourself I promise. wanting to change is a great first step! I hope everything works out for you and power through!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">For me, I had to confront the reality of my own failures to get rid of toxic shame- and to realise that it didn't matter that I'd failed so many classes, I'd barely gone outside, I'd been high all the time because I had decided that I WANTED to change. IMO, as soon as you decide to take control of your life its ok to forgive yourself for your past failures because we're living for the future, not the past. You have to kind of soft parent yourself in a way. The reality of your failure might seem all consuming, but there is always time to do better! Who cares if you failed 5 years in a row? The likelihood of you succeeding is not lowered by your past failures. *The chances of you succeeding now has nothing to do with your past failures, if you forgive yourself and start living for the now.* 

You also have to accept that sometimes you do everything right and shit still doesn't work out. But isn't it better to try, to see your full potential through? It hurts honestly, when you put your all into work and you get a bad grade. But I'd rather feel that nowadays, and do better the next time, than never know what I'm even capable of. The first grade I got back after I started my journey was a D- and I thought man, I'm doing all this and it doesn't even matter.. and a week later I got back another test- 99%!! You never know what's waiting around the corner when you start to embrace yourself and unlearn the stuff that left you with cptsd to begin with. Its long. Its hard. I still have nights where I cry for no reason or I'm paralysed, unable to do anything. But now that I've changed my reality, its so much easier to get up the next day and catch up on shit. Or remind myself i AM capable. Realising you owe it to yourself to believe in your abilities, believe YOU not what other people have said or thought about you, unlocks so much!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don't see how making art could ever have been a waste.

Human art is not to become valueless just because AI makes great art. Also it's not just "telling the computer", making high quality AI images requires a ton of hard earned expertise, work, and skill. The products achieved by simply prompting are extremely sub par compared to the best of what can be done by the most skilled AI artists. There's very much a huge and noticeable skill gap in AI art among the best and worst creators, and those coming from art backgrounds produce far better images.

If you and I were both given 24 hours to make the best AI image, I would probably beat you 10/10 times due to my experience and art background. Even if you had 3 months to practice, I'd probably still win. However, if you and someone that doesn't have your art background were competing, you would also likely beat them 100% of the time.

Regardless, I love AI art as a medium, but I still prefer physical paintings as art, even though I think they're both creative, artistic, and skill based. They coexist and will continue to coexist. Don't let AI take the wind out of your sails; manually drawing is still beautiful and amazing and impressive and that isn't changing any time soon.</div>

For example, an SWE in a team working on some authentication system can be/is replaced by an integrated solution like Okta. However, we need someone to go under the hood and plug everything together.

                        <div class="comment-body">Absolutely and there needs to be more discussions on this. Not many productivity posts cater to menstruating women like us, even on r/Periods.

I’m very energetic after my period. I study and do grocery shopping as usual. Sometimes I go sightseeing far away. I use walking as an exercise.

The week before period is when I’m the angriest and most distracted. I just relax in my room and avoid going outside due to PMS paranoia.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Definitely! At first, I thought it was nonsense, but after tracking my study hours and productivity daily for the past six months, I’ve realized it actually makes a huge difference. My productivity takes a sharp dip during the late luteal phase/PMS (Days 25–28)—even the simplest chores and studying require way more effort. On the other hand, I have peak energy and motivation during the follicular phase.

During my period, I tweak my schedule to be lighter and give myself extra breaks so I don’t burn out or lose the study streaks I’ve worked hard for. I think it’s important to go easy on yourself and acknowledge the effort it takes just to show up despite the pain and discomfort. That mindset shift has helped me feel better about not always being at 100%, and surprisingly, I get right back on track after my period!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I am similar... But I do find a difference between how physically productive and mentally productive I am (I.e., exercising and chores versus working at my computer and solving problems). Lately, I push myself to exercise, even when am in my luteal phase and I really don’t want to, and I found this really helps with my mental productivity. And maybe this is obvious - I know exercise is good for your brain, duh. But I used to take the approach of trying not to wear myself down physically when I wasn’t feeling it… and now I’m not so sure that’s the right approach.

Just my thoughts! Curious what others experience.</div>

They also aim to make it illegal to possess or view pornography, and extra illegal to make or distribute it. Extra extra illegal if it's trans porn.

"*Pornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children, for instance, is not a political Gordian knot inextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual liberation, and child welfare. It has no claim to First Amendment protection. Its purveyors are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women. Their product is as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime. Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.*"</div>

They closed down beaches and parks and had neighbors reporting each other for leaving the house. Using your device to track your proximity to those who may have been exposed to a disease that was asymptomatic in a majority of cases. Make that make sense.

Tell me how anti-capitalist you are and then defend Pfizer to the death. United Healthcare is the root of all evil, but Moderna is the incarnation of goodwill towards mankind.</div>

Perhaps it seems a bit dystopian, but people simply tried to combat a once in a lifetime pandemic the best they could. Nobody could track your device without you downloading the app. There was no federal reporting system (some states and counties got a bit excessive, and of course there are fringe crazy cases) Nobody was held at gun point or put into Covid Camps (cough cough China). Plenty of people didnt vaccinate Of course, we had to quarantine, it is the most crucial step in preventing disease spread. Is that dystopian? 

Jesus christ, its a couple years on, life is back to completely normal, and masses of people have not died to the covid vaccine. You know what what did kill alot of people, elderly, infants, immunocompromised, etc? Covid.  I hope a far more lethal, drug resistance pathogen doesn't spring up again in our lifetimes. You will lock all of your doors self quarantine while begging for modern medicine to save you.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don't get why so many of you are confused by this. Using an app to track contact with an asymptomatic disease is literally a textbook perfect use in a pandemic scenario, that's not disputable. If you have a contagious disease, minizing contagion helps. 

You can say it went too far but dropping in conspiracies when most world governments reacted the same way is dumb. Asia, Russia, Europe, Americas, no government in the world found these conspiracies in their mortal enemies but the people who are warm to Alex Jones' ideas did?

The anti capitalists want socialized health care because companies like Pfizer and Moderna abuse things that are beneficial to the point of being required for modern society for profit. Unfortunately with the system we built we are kind of stuck with the current incarnation of pharmaceutical companies because in most cases medicines and vaccine do more good than harm. Its not really an inconsistent view point unless you conflate the defense of vaccines with defense of for profit medical industry.</div>

I completely agree and see that he is just repeating the same old political stuff since 2020. I personally still enjoy the episodes enough to listen to them. 
But I see the same people making posts here and commenting about how annoying he has become etc etc, but yet why just not move on to some other podcast?

                        <div class="comment-body">I speak only for myself, but I think it’s because I used to like the podcast and Joe so much. Like it was my favorite podcast. 

And a little part of me still wants to like it. So I come here in and check in. In hopes that maybe the podcast has gone back to the old format. 

The days of crazy Alex jones and Johnny bravo. Paul stamets talking about mushroom hats, and talk of aliens and ancient civilizations. 

I liked pre covid Joe, and I hope that someday maybe we can get back to that.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">theres still a few episodes that are pretty good.  Like recently, I enjoyed Steve Rinela because I think he’s a great storyteller and always comes with cool stories and facts.  The episode started with Joes political rant but Rinela does a decent job at changing subjects.  You need to just watch guests that enjoy talking and are interesting enough to where Joe becomes the listener. Problem is he gets guests that look up to him and rely on Joe to carry conversation which just ends up being brain rot politics</div>
