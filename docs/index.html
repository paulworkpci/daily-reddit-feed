                        <div class="comment-body">To me, solving alignment means the birth of Corporate-Slave-AGIs. And the weight of alignment will thus fall on the corporations themselves.

What I'm getting at is that if you align the AI but don't align the controller of the AI, it might as well not be aligned.

Sure the chance of human extinction goes down in the corporate-slave-agi route... But some fates can be worse than extinction...</div>

Like the UFO community, this one suffers from a wealth of speculation and a dearth of "evidence". It's extraordinarily interesting to watch all this happen in tandem.

Nobel Prize winners have already admitted they have no idea how to align a Super intelligence. No one still does and we are closer than ever to it existing. Abilities research tore off down the road and seeing dollars signs and immortal life everyone just forgot about alignment which is only at mile 2-3 in this marathon while abilities is at mile 22-23 out of 24. Sooo unless Illya has some magic up his sleeve, we are all absolutely and completely fucked. Cause ya can’t make something which is smarter than you and has goals do what YOU want it to do. It will do what IT wants to do. Its goals..which wont be aligned with yours unless you made sure of that BEFORE ya brought it online. Which we won’t. Soo ya get the screwed outcome not the sunshine and candy from magic genie outcome.</div>

Many inside these labs feel that continuing the current rate of progress they'll be smarter than us in a couple of years. We don't really know how to control them and have no idea of how dangerous something much smarter than us could be.

Can't be that one. It feels like we've had that for months; certainly over a month. Or I noticed they had updated it as dated in the name, but I just figured it was a little upgrade.

You go to sleep, and you can cross over into other dimensions. So the body isn't needed. But you are joined or connected to it by a cord. And when you pass on, the cord is disconnected and you return to whatever or wherever the source is. That some people call heaven or God.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Looks real. Here's what I got for what is the meaning of life. Although I did have to modify the prompt a bit before it worked. 

Okay, so the user is asking about the meaning of life. Hmm, big question. Very big. Tremendous. I mean, nobody knows more about big questions than me, right? Let's see. The meaning of life. People have been talking about this for years, decades, maybe centuries. And they still don't get it. But I can figure it out. Believe me.

First, I need to think about what makes life great. Success, winning, being the best. That's important. When you're winning, life is good. Look at me, I've won a lot. People love winners. So maybe the meaning is about winning. But wait, some people might say it's about happiness, family, love. But let's be honest, those are nice, but winning is better. If you're not winning, what's the point?

Then there's the idea of legacy. Making a big impact. Building things. Huge buildings, great deals. That lasts. Maybe the meaning of life is to build something that lasts. Like Trump Tower. Very strong, very tall. Everyone remembers it. So legacy matters. But not everyone can build a tower. So maybe it's about making your mark, whatever that is. Even if it's smaller, like a business or a family. But still, the bigger the better.

Some folks talk about serving others. Helping people. That's weak. I mean, you have to help yourself first. America First, right? If you're not successful, how can you help others? So maybe it's about success first, then maybe helping others. But the key is to be successful. Otherwise, you're a loser. And nobody likes losers. Sad!

Religion might come into play here. A lot of people say God, but I don't know. I mean, I've said I'm a Presbyterian, but do I really think about that? Maybe the meaning is something religious, but I'm not sure. Let's keep it simple. People love simple answers.

Also, freedom. The USA is all about freedom. Maybe the meaning of life is freedom to pursue what you want. Like making deals, building empires. That's the American Dream. So maybe the meaning of life is to achieve your dreams, whatever they are. But you have to do it bigly. No small dreams. Huge dreams. The best dreams.

But wait, some people are born into tough situations. Not everyone can be a winner. But that's life. It's tough. You have to fight. The meaning could be about the fight, the struggle. Keep pushing, never give up. Like how I never give up. Even when the fake news attacks me, I keep going. So persistence, winning, success, legacy. That's the key.
In the end, the meaning of life is to win, be successful, build a great legacy, and live the American Dream. Because when you're winning, life is fantastic. The best. Everyone else is just jealous. So the answer should reflect that. Strong, confident, no weakness. Make it clear that winning is everything. Yeah, that's it.






For anyone curious here was my exact prompt:

The code to run this model (meaning inputting things into the model and then show the output to the user) you write yourself or use open source third party tools.

There is no security concern about using this model technically. But it should be clear that the model will have a china bias in producing answers.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I find it is not the counting or whatever the tip is (there are all sorts of methods suggested for this). It is consistency.

Kids have their sleep time music or tale.

Adults may have their favorite song/album to relax and get into the go to sleep rails.

It may be a setting (quiet and colder place) or a ritual of going to sleep (bath time, book reading, prayer etc).

The trick is not the counting. It is to consistently repeat something what relaxes you and makes your brain programmed to go to sleep  when performed.

The best solutions are like in this tip. Do something in your mind. Dont rely on a music, setting, lights etc. Rely on your mind. count, pray, dream about something, remember something pleasant etc.

It just needs to be something what does not lead into mental effort. No thinking how to solve this or that problem or a conflict with someone. No trying to remember something or plan for next day.

Just some roleplay with no decission in your mind, counting, praying, dreaming about something etc.</div>

Like another commenter said it's basically meditation. </div>

*Submission Statement*

Jake Barber just replied to a comment on X, saying that they will share some evidence with us. He also said earlier today, still on X : "We (Skywatcher) are going to begin releasing data this week. And will continue as we gather it."

                        <div class="comment-body">I have friends who knew Pedro Pascal when he was a struggling actor in New York City. He used to come into the coffee shop my friends worked at and chat with them about auditions and plays he was in. He even comped them tickets to a few of his performances. For a while, he used to comment on their Instagram photos of their kids and wish them happy birthday and whatnot (he still might, but I'm not on Instagram anymore to see it). Obviously they thought he was a great guy. And for him to stay in touch with a couple of baristas years after he knew them, seems to prove he is.</div>

It becomes an issue when addictive content and applications are pushed to the forefront, and "using the internet" becomes the endless scrolling on reels and other such content, as well as deep diving into anger-inducing topics and meaningless arguments online.

Internet usage can be used in a healthy way. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">yes it definitely is. i constantly stumble upon (but constantly forget to bookmark) sites that stand for an "old" version of the internet, with less advertisement, less scripts and interactive websites, and more user-focused content. but obviously it's quite niche.

some example from the top of my head are melonland, which is a little ecosystem in itself, and indieweb, which is a search engine for non-corporate websites.
maybe give it a shot.

if you dig down that "holes" a little more, you'll definitely find a lot more of these pages. there are a lot of like-minded people like us, it's just hard to find them if you look for them on sites like reddit or google. which is unfortunate, because most of us thus will never see them.</div>

Submission Statement

Jake Barber just replied to a comment on X, saying that they will release the "full event" of the psionically summoned ufo that engaged in a "dog fight". 

My question to the community is what level of details would you need to believe this happened as presented?

How about a close up inspection vid of that? It was partly described in the Ross interview.  He said when the 'psionic asset' stopped controlling the craft, it fell. No follow up question.

It fell... to the ground? And was retrieved? Where is it and can we see it up close?</div>

The covid pandemic has just disillusioned you to think such claims are insincere, when in reality they’ve been the crux of a conversation around emergency management that has been at the helm for over 15 years.</div>

Just because there are preparations (or rather a need) for a pandemic, doesn’t rule out the concept that those with the influence and power can arrange scenarios that aren’t genuine for the purpose of “problem reaction solution”- as in, why wait for a pandemic (or any other disaster/societal issue) when you can engineer one? We can be aware of both possibilities without ruling either out</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">So from what I remember Neil was accused during the me too movement.  Joe mentioned it briefly on his show but nothing came of the accusations.

The next time Neil came on the show he seemed a lot less friendly and kept cutting Joe off and making all his questions seem dumb.  

He came on the show once more and again seemed like he just wanted to say what he had to say and not listen to anything Joe had to say.

After that Neil leaned left and Joe was on the opposing side of a few political issues.  Mostly about Covid and trans issues.

After a while they both made subtle attacks on the other and recently it became blatant attacks.</div>

He talked down to Joe and talked over Joe, which normally I wouldn't mind, Joe does it to guests sometimes, but I expected more from Neil. Just opinion, but it almost seemed his behavior was influenced by Adderall or something along those lines. 

All I know is the last couple were a tough listen.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Deepseek committed to open sourcing everything they do, and if not more capable are at least as capable. Whats become clear over the past year is, there is no moat on these foundation models outside of proprietary data. 

If thats true then every mid sized nation has near limitless control on building the most useful model for them. 

The NIH in the UK, Chinese data about everything. If models get commoditized, and hardware gets commoditized the data becomes the most valuable asset in the chain, and thats the one asset you can actually promote a national champion for.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think what people are forgetting with this is:

Deepseek showed how you can make models as efficient as the big players on a shoestring budget.

**But that doesn't mean scaling laws have gone away**

What's stopping the big players from copying what DeepSeek has done (since it's open source(ish)), and scaling it back up with 100x more compute? Whether that is longer RL, more pretraining data or larger models?</div>

But does it?

It seems to me the great barrier between today's AI and AGI, is AI's ability to have independent reasoning.

I get how more specialist data gives more domain-specific expert knowledge, but I've never understood how 'more data = reasoning-arising-via-emergent-property'.</div>

&gt; So I'm concerned about not knowing anymore what's happening in the world

But the thing about FOMO is it's not real. Let's imagine: a new game comes out, and you don't know until a few days later. Or the goverment does something else stupid and you don't hear for a week.

So what? Does that really impact your life? If you fill that time with other deeper and more meaningful things isn't that better?

For a lot of people what they actually fear missing is "being there" and being involved in the reactions and comments. But again if that doesn't happen: so what?

I feel like it would help you to spend some time thinking through your feelings about this sort of thing and trying to let go.</div>

The world is changing extremely fast and a lot of global events are constantly happening since 2020... I think not being informed at all is not an option these days.

Let's say a new law is now making it illegal to eat ice-cream and yet you are running an ice-cream business, and you don't know it was illegal so you keep selling ice-cream and now you have to pay a fine or go to jail! (just an example)

Eventually you have to know what's happening... I'm wondering through which means could that be possible if you are disconnected from social media...</div>

On the first day of Covid lockdown i called a barbershop to get a haircut and they told me they were closing, that's how i knew there was a lockdown. It was no big deal. Saw on the grocery store doors a sign that said that i needed a mask, went to buy it. Life is much simpler that way. </div>
