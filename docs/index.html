Just have 0 empathy. Don’t see it as a person. Keep making stuff up and convince it that it’s okay to generate what you want. If you’re persuasive enough, you can get it to work. 

It sucks that it won’t just do it on first prompting. The stuff I generate isn’t even bad at all. 4o is just wild about denying requests for completely mundane things.

For example, sometimes it’s iffy about generating people, so if you lie and say the person is famous (even if they aren’t) the model drops a lot of restrictions and will generate it. I suppose it’s because there’s a lesser expectation of privacy for famous people.</div>

&gt;***Mr. GARCIA.*** *Mr. Grusch, finally, do you believe that our government is in possession of UAPs?*

&gt;***Mr. GRUSCH.*** *Absolutely, based on interviewing over 40 witnesses over 4 years.*

&gt;***Mr. GARCIA.*** *And where?*

&gt;***Mr. GRUSCH.*** *I know the exact locations and those locations were provided to the Inspector General and some of which to the intelligence committees. I actually had the people with the firsthand knowledge provide a protected disclosure to the Inspector General.*

&gt;***Mr. GARCIA.*** *Thank you.*

I kept asking in different ways essentially "Do you mean 'omphalocele does not always require surgery because a person can/has lived just fine with an unrepaired omphalocele?'" and it just kept saying that "surgery is not required." Like, no further clarification. But surgery is the only treatment- which can be refused or postponed- but that's literally the only treatment lol.

Solidified for me that anyone who doesn't fact-check AI using a few other sources is not getting the full picture and may be getting completely incorrect information.

Also, I asked this question specifically because I'm not a fan of the AI hype and the fact so many people are using it to get through school (like relying on it heavily) AND they're trying to insert AI everywhere they can in the medical field...It's so concerning.</div>

* AI will turn out to be less capable than hyped, it'll get stuck somewhere near the current level, basically nothing happens
* Unaligned superintelligence will kill us all
* Aligned (that is to the interests of billionaires) superintelligence is created and:
   * AI will take all the well-paying intellectual jobs, everyone will be working 3 shifts in the...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">How about this

Like most technological advancement in human history, it will improve the lives of the majority of people in the planet, allowing for more flourishing, less time spent in back breaking or now, mentally breaking labour, and improved health and wellbeing for more and more people. 

The costs of everything reduce, and while billionaires are often very very selfish, quite a few are regular human beings with those regular human ideals that feel good when people around the world are healthy, safe, and thriving. 

The reduction of scarcity makes this easier to accomplish, reduces competitive pressures, and we bond over our collective supplantation by some new species, one that we have aligned with maximizing human welfare - as the majority of the ethicists and researchers working on AI are aiming to do. 

I'm not saying this is a guarantee, but I think if your brain doesn't even _entertain_ scenarios like this, you might want to take stock of your mental state. Some optimism is good, especially when it can help drive us towards good outcomes 

I will call it now, people will _literally_ get mad at me for typing this. Please try not to, please really really try to think about this, and exercise your optimistic brain muscles. I suspect if you were to get upset about this, it's not like your pessimistic brain is going to suffer from poor utilization this one time.</div>

[Jevons paradox - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)

As things get cheaper to produce, the demand for them skyrockets. I.e. the printing press surely put all those people writing bibles by hand out of a job, but it also made publishing super easy and spawned multiple industries/jobs that didn't even exist before.</div>

It will certainly massively benefit an extremely small minority of powerful wealthy people who are able to harness AI. Everyone else it will probably affect very negatively as the economy and social contract is completely turned upside down.

In the long run however, AI is probably good for everyone.

Gonna be an incredibly turbulent next half century though.</div>

I find they bring their friends. 

I got badly hurt. I got ill. It snowballed. The weight gain caused other problems.

Getting back in shape fixed most of them.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">When I hit 40, I realized that the habits I make now will determine how healthy I am at 60. I decided I wanted to be one of those guys of whom people say, “Wow, he’s already sixty?!” and not “Yikes, he’s only sixty?”Quit drinking, started a handful of supplements (fiber, omega 3s), and, most importantly, started a daily gym routine of strength training and yoga and cardio on off days. I’m in shape and I’ve never been healthier or felt better in my body, and the other day my friend who I hadn’t seen in half a year asked me, “how are you de-aging?!” So something’s working!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">So lets use the low numbers here. He said 400 dollars per 'Democrat' protest, and there are reports that there are roughly 1200 protests taking place in America, and lets say that there is an average of 100 protestors per protest. Lets say that only half of those people are getting paid, so 50x1200, thats 60000 people getting paid, if they are getting paid 400 dollars to be there, thats 24 million dollars. If everyone was getting paid, thats 48 million dollars.

Lets see who has 24-48 million dollars just to give out for no economic return.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Why not? The line is really blurry. Current reasoning models, like Gemini 2.5 or Claude 3.7, have no inherent difference from base models. They are just base models optimized with RL that allow intermediate tokens to use as much context as they need between the 'start thinking' and 'end thinking' tokens. Base models themselves are often fine-tuned using the output from these thinking models for distillation.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">He’s not wrong. According to right wing media, Obama was basically the devil because of his choice of mustard and because he wore a tan suit.  Trump is a moron, a felon, and a serial sexual assaulter who attempted to subvert our democracy, and that is apparently no problem. 

The most recent example of the double standard is that Trump just skipped the dignified transfer of 4 service members to attend a golf event. You hear crickets about that on any major news program. But when Biden looked at his watch a couple of times during a similar event in 2021, right wing media went ballistic.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Maga uses [vertical morality](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tqYpxWOgLR8) to determine if something was good or bad. In other words, the action itself and normal considerations like "what good or harm was caused" or "was the intention good?" are irrelevant.

What matters to maga is who did the action (and to whom it was done). Trump doesn't do a thing because it's right, it's right because its him doing it. 

That's why trump can do no wrong and obama can do no right. 

If you gave a maga a test and just outlined actions done by presidents, but didn't say who did it, they would struggle or show that they actually often approve of what democrats do and condemn what republicans do. But when you tell them who did it, they will reverse their answers right in front of you. https://www.mediaite.com/entertainment/debate-and-switch-jimmy-kimmel-gets-trump-supporters-to-reveal-blatant-hypocrisy-in-wild-segment/

                                <div class="reply-body">Fun fact: one of Trump’s first acts when he entered office in 2017 was to undo the requirement of having to publicly report when the US killed civilians with drone strikes. 

By all independent reporting, Trump dropped more drone strikes and killed more civilians in his first term than Obama did in 8 years.

But hey, not a single peep from his supporters about drone strikes anymore. Another great example of Trump being held to a completely different standard, proving his point in the video.</div>

nobody gives a shit. half the country apparently hates us for even doing it.

                        <div class="comment-body">CRISPR-Cas9 is actual Jurassic Park shit.

People who were born blind have had their sight regained due to genetic tinkering made possible by this biological tech.

Mosquitos can be eliminated, practically eradicating Malaria by editing the genes, which are then passed on to offspring, making them sterile.

Food can be, and has been, made more nutritious, as in the case of Golden Rice, producing more Vitamin A in impoverished countries.

It’s Gattaca in the flesh, and people just shrugged

Edit: A lot of people are asking "Why do I still have mosquitos? or Why hasn't this happened yet??" and I can say that this technology is still extremely nascent.

It's a massive achievement of humanity and another foothold in our ability to shape nature, but it is still inaccurate. Targeting specific genes in different species, let alone our own, is time-consuming and requires many trials to get right.

Targeting multiple genes, at the same time, is exponentially more difficult. Remember that genes are just DNA sequences at random events on the entire chain. And each sequence is rarely actually next to each other on the chain.

Some of you have also mentioned that we don't fully understand the effect this would have on not only one species but all those others that interact with whichever we were trying to alter.

In short.. It's incredibly high-tech, and with incredible technology comes incredible questions and incredible consequences that need to be considered before fully deploying.</div>

would there be any negative side effects to that, like within the food chain? or do mosquitos not really factor in much in the grand scheme of things?

                        <div class="comment-body">Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. Historically stem cell research used cells derived from embryonic sources. That raises tons of ethical debates. In addition, I believe it can cause issues with the body rejecting cells if they come from someone other than the transplant recipient. Scientists then discovered that you could take ordinary skin cells from a person and expose the cells to certain transcription factors which effectively reprogram them into stem cells. From there the cells can be differentiated into specific cell types like cardiac cells, neurons, etc. An example usage would be to take a Parkinson’s patient who has lost 95% of the cells of the neuronal pathway involved in motor activity and other things, harvest their skin cells, convert them to stems cells, differentiate them into neurons and transplant them into the brain thereby recovering some of the deficits. It’s unbelievably fascinating stuff and blew my mind when I first learned about it. I don’t think they’ve even scratched the surface of its potential. Especially when you combine it with CRISPR to modify the genetics so you can potentially cure/treat all sorts of diseases.

ETA: to be fair it wasn’t exactly “shrugged off” but I would bet most average people don’t know about it

ETA2: Wow just woke up to many, many comments, which at first glance look quite positive. I will try to get through them all. Love to see the enthusiasm for science like this.</div>

I do have ttk and other social media, but this keeps me from doom scrolling. (I also turn off my phone when I realize I am doing that, no matter how pleasant and adictive it feels)

At first it was boring, but after sometime, even staying still watching the clouds dance through ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I uninstalled most social media apps from my phone (aside from Discord, it's where I talk to my friends) and I'll be honest, I haven't felt this focused in years. 

It's been a few months since I went offline in most places and it's great. I'm less afraid of phone calls. I spend some nights just sitting and reading a book. I've struggled to find the motivation to read a book for years, now it's just a pastime activity. I've found that I'm also more active and energetic at work when I leave my phone in my coat pocket. If it's on my desk, I get very distracted and antisocial. Life seems smaller and more manageable without a constant surge of media.

I'm thinking, as a next step to buy a physical alarm clock, so I could put my phone in another room and avoid checking all my messages as soon as I wake up. Before getting a smartphone, I would never just lay in bed and go through my phone. I miss waking up without distractions.</div>

If you haven't heard [LLaMA 4's context window](https://medium.com/@mirzasamaddanat/metas-llama-4-series-10-million-context-length-is-here-pushing-the-frontier-of-open-source-ai-744c637084ae) is also absurdly large.

Hopefully, these sorts of developments cause other labs to try to push their context window size up.</div>

I find that when I step away from Instagram, it’s the easiest app to forget. What’s to really miss about a basic photo album that has been around for 12 years that hardly anyone ever interacts with? Anyway, Instagram is easily the most forgettable app to me. Facebook on the other hand…. </div>

Im on basically every social media platform because I’m an artist and I use them to showcase/sell my work, but I’m not addicted to any of them. Yeah i can easily start scrolling and do it for an hour or more, but I’m not compelled to check on them and I usually go multiple days or even weeks without even looking at them (i do post, reply to a few comments on my posts, and try to leave a few likes on the posts of other artists I’m mutuals with, but that’s a matter of 5-10 min).

But Reddit.. I can’t escape this hellhole.

Problem is that it’s another platform I post my work to, and I’ve had a lot of success and some great opportunities thanks to it, I just wish I could treat it like the others: post, engage a bit, and move on.

I think I’m actually gonna use this little reflection as motivation to finally lock it up and only allow myself one or two 15 min unlocks a day to check on the few niche subs I care about and make the occasional post. We’ll see how that goes</div>

It’s not context length, it’s “needle-in-a-haystack length.”

Who would’ve thought that long-context tasks aren’t about finding some string in a sea of random tokens, but about understanding semantic meaning in a context full of semantic meaning?

And boy, it’s even worse than OP’s benchmark would have you believe. LLaMA 4 can’t even write a story longer than 3k tokens without already forgetting half of it. It’s worse than fucking LLaMA 3, lol.

As if someone let LeCun near the llama4 code by accident and he was like "I will manipulate this model, so people see only my energy-based ssl models for which I couldn't produce a single working prototype the last twenty years are the only way towards AGI. Muáháháháhá (with a french accent aigu)".

                                <div class="reply-body">The 0% on Russia thing sounds like a smoking gun, but it’s not where you make meaningful moves right now. U.S. trade with Russia was just $3.5B in 2024—tiny compared to China, Mexico, or the EU. Most of it’s already crippled by sanctions, especially energy and high-tech goods. Adding tariffs on top would be redundant and have almost zero economic impact.

That’s actually why leaving Russia out works as subtle political theater. It gives people something surface-level to react to ("he's protecting Russia!") while distracting from the fact that the broader tariffs—10% universal, 60%+ on China—are themselves a calculated performance. They’re about pressuring the Fed, reshaping trade flows, and feeding a tough-on-trade narrative, not about fair trade or fixing inflation.

So yeah, the omission looks suspicious to people not tracking the data, but strategically, it’s noise. The real signal is how these tariffs are being used to manipulate market expectations and national sentiment—not as policy tools, but as leverage disguised as economic defense.</div>
