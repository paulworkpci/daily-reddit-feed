                        <div class="comment-body">I am currently working on a similar system. I wouldn't even say that the sword example you have is the biggest issue. There are more important ones:

1. Most LLM RPG games have no pre-defined goals. You literally cannot win or lose, so there are no stakes.

2. LLMs are not creative (default to tropes &amp; cliches). You, as an author, will have to create the world, things that happen in the world, and very strict rules. Of course, there are literally infinite possibilities, so the LLM will have to assume a bunch of things for you, but try to write down the most important ones beforehand at least.

Bit of a sidenote, but if you want realism, there really is no "locked in combat" or RPG systems. I'd avoid healthpoints, stamina, etc, unless you're doing D&amp;D specifically.

3. The modern "big" LLMs try to avoid tension by default. If you tell them, they will try to relieve tension as quickly as possible. You need a dice-roll system to prevent this, but the dice-roll system should not be rolled on simple actions like "look around", for example.

4. It depends on what you want, but in my case, I have a pre-defined story, and a set of rules limits players that a "fresh" LLM verifies beforehand. It includes asking for clarity in case it's necessary, and allowing / not allowing what a player does, for example, here is one of my rules:

A player can only perform a single, focused, contiguous effort. Actions that are overly broad, vague, or attempt to skip the process to get to the outcome are not permitted. The player must engage with the world step-by-step, instead of issuing summary commands. Similarly, you can’t brute-force actions.

Incorrect (Too Broad): "I search the entire library for the secret book."

Correct (Granular): "I start by searching the shelves in the history section."</div>

I’m also finding it tricky to devise a way to introduce randomness and unique events—otherwise, the AI will always default to the same stories, outcomes, and decisions over time. The challenge is to make the randomness logical, not purely arbitrary, so that it resembles the way a human would make interesting decisions.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I do think starting with smaller aspirations is key to hashing out something interesting. Infinite worlds and infinite adventures is swinging for the moon, when something that can run a simple campaign module or even simpler hex crawl would be incredibly useful all on its own.

Scaffolding is paramount. If you want permanence and object tracking, the LLM isn't the tool for the job.

For example, let's take the issue of time. Time is abstracted away massively in these systems, we don't track the exact position of a butterfly in Texas every single micro-second. Things the player is directly interacting with, like while in a fight, get updated turn by turn. Distant things, like a kingdom going to war with another one, get their clock updated at much smaller intervals. Events might not be updated with time at all, but require trigger conditions like in a video game.

The LLM obviously can't filter through every single world object to see if they need to have their state modified. This kind of thing is bad enough on the LLMs playing Pokemon, who often stop to navel-gaze their entire cosmos before continuing on. And that's only a half dozen or so matters that they contemplate; an RPG world should have dozens or hundreds of things going on. (Having stuff like a town with NPCs with daily routines is something a computer can keep track of so much more easily than a human gamemaster.)

The scaffolding should take care of all that automatically. If a bomb is ticking down, for real, it should be the one updating states on the side. If the LLM needs to make a decision about altering the world state, it needs to bring this to its attention and query it. Providing necessary context.

Our own brains work the same way, with modules that automatically carry out their functions whether we want them to or not. The whole 'don't think of a pink elephant' thing.

Flexibility are what the LLM's are good at. Games require more rigid rules.

One thing that comes to mind, I can't find it right now... but there was a game made by TSR or Wizards that was a passion project for one of their designers. It was some kind of abstract thing without really any rules, maybe about gods or concepts I don't remember it very well. It was really well received during internal testing when he was the one running the game, but whenever someone else tried to, well..... One comment someone made was "This game would sell really well if we could ship Dave inside of the box."

I guess there's a couple lessons to learn from that. When a GM isn't too talented yet or doesn't have the energy, leaning on the rules to have interesting things happen is useful. (Hex crawls are a platonic example of that, almost like a board game. If using an OSR philosophy, a survival-horror board game where the players try to loot things from places people shouldn't be.) Seems a more practical target while working on making a Dave (or whatever his real name was).

Think of how awful impermanence feels. If you're in AI Dungeon and you're creating a character, putting a bit of time and emotion only to have all the numbers and skills selected to go whiff or not matter. Why would a player care about anything then? Even a doomed throw-away destined-to-become-goblin-fodder PC in an OSR that's some dice rolls, a name, and a class deserves better than that.

Conservatives have enough violence issues, they shouldn't be blamed for shit they didn't do. Almost like calling every conservative a fascist, then calling for the death of fascists can cause political violence....wow I would have never guessed.</div>

5 years ago, I died of a sudden, unexpected widow maker heart attack and was dead for at least 20 minutes, then in a coma for weeks. 

There's now a RED folder on my desk with a financial summary and everything needed to be aware of and access accounts.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, write down your Advanced Directives and don't just give copies to your next of kin - actually tell them what it means and what you want.

My family tried to help me by requesting that I be taken off advanced cardiac life support twice because my own  instructions weren't clear, and the doctors were telling them I might have to be institutionalized for life due to the brain damage.

Today, my Directives say: "if two independent physicians have established that I am brain dead, and do not have any brain activity, I am to be disconnected from life support."</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’ve had to assist THREE times with this shit and it’s unnecessarily exhausting. It’s also an insurmountable task for most people, who are not tech savvy enough to backdoor their way past things like 2FA account security. The first time I did this it was for my mom. The second time was for my boss. The third time was for my friend’s mom (I’ve started getting recruited for this since I’ve apparently gotten good at it).

I am not fucking around with my own info, I refuse to put anyone through this mind numbing trial when I die. My will has my master password for my password manager, my iCloud login, my device passwords, safe codes, and instructions on how to access absolutely everything in my life I currently keep secure. I even have a list of recurring bills and what accounts they come out of. 

Please for the love of god, do this for your loved ones.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Just wanna add this is called, ‘scaffolding’ and is probably one of the first and most useful things to get someone rolling. And thinking the right way about using ai as a tool:

“How do I get the ai to do blank?” 

“Try asking the ai how to ask the ai”

I’ll use the free gpt 5 to review Claude’s code for example. Or say something to a non-censored model like:

“I need a prompt for an image model that will generate an image of Superman but he’s black. Don’t mention superman by name.”

So it will give me something that will produce a black superman by chatGPT w/o it just refusing because ‘copyright’ 

So this is a basic jailbreak too: asking for something indirectly. Once you know the trigger, you just work backwards and avoid it. 

You can use scaffolding laterally, or up/down in model. So like if you ask Gemini 1.5 for a prompt and give it to gpt5, you’re still going to get an input faster and more useful than a human would give you.

Edit: you will probably still get a useful prompt*

And also sometimes the ai will, say or do something ‘dumb’ or make a mistake, that most of the time is just that. 

occasionally ai AND humans do this AND why hallucinations by ai is a FEATURE not a bug: 

the mistake is the right move. This is why ‘dumb’ ideas get rejected by smart people but picked up again and kicked back up to be re-evaluated, and it’s how ideas evolve. 

the best ideas are not being generated by the smartest people. In fact, they be missing the majority of them, because they are hyper focused on something they miss the forest for the leaves.</div>

In their new long horizon execution benchmark, GPT-5 comfortably outperforms Claude, Gemini and Grok by 2x! Guess GPT-5 was codenamed as "Horizon" for a reason.

                        <div class="comment-body">For what I understood it is akin to numerical errors in computing.

If a task can be broken in many steps but each step has small errors, the errors compounds and the task that can be completed is relatively short (in number of steps).

In the figure posted by OP, only GPT5 is able to solve very long tasks while the others go astray because their errors hurt their abilities after a while.

In short most models cannot complete long task because their error rate cripple them even if their approach is correct.

Thinking helps as the thinking process picks the best "output" so to speak that then contains less errors and thus the model can solve more steps.

E: hmm. If I understand the test done there, practically they say: "there is a dictionary of short words. Each word has a weight. Each step gives you a list of words. Pick the related weight and sum it to the existing. Keep the sum for the next step". I am not sure whether LLMs without tools can reliably do basic math beside very often mentioned quantities. That is, if the quantity they need to sum is not that common in the training data, they may go astray just due to that. Hence the thinking can help a ton on this. I would rather prefer a test where the LLMs keep using text (say, a A1z26 cipher or the like to keep the result short and textual) so that they don't have to know how to do basic math computation if they don't have access to tools.

E2: I am searching online if LLMs can reliably add numbers up to a certain number of digits without tools and the answer seems to be no. So while it is true that the benchmark is still somewhat valid, I wonder if it is rather a "let's see which model can guess the number better" once the sum is large enough. It would be different, and could be that the authors do it but I missed it, if they would verify that the model is indeed able to add the numbers when only one step is involved. If the model is able to add the numbers within one step but it is unable in many steps, then the benchmark is valid.</div>

Hi! this is a very valid question! however, we do our bests to ensure that the "one-step" accuracy (what you have mentioned here) of all models is very high. That is exactly why we chose such a simple task, so that any errors we see are not because models are bad at the task, but they are bad at the task \*when ran for more turns\*. 

We see that all models that we test (&gt; 4B) have perfect 100% first step accuracy on all our tests. While of course this is empirical, we thought it to be good enough evidence that this task is not hard for LLMs in a single turn. Thank you for the question!</div>

If you want something that gives you full control over the agent and adds browser integration and multi agent support, check out Code.

Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate. It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29th. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.</div>

With an open mind (well, maybe not entirely), I began with a book by Jack Kornfield, *Meditation for Beginners*.  
If you’ve never had anything to do with meditation, you might imagine an old man with a long beard sitting on a mountain or in a cave, not moving, radiating some kind of mystical aura.  
But according to Jack, it was actually quite simple: you sit down, close your eyes, don’t move, and observe. You let your thoughts drift by like clouds in the sky or le...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Very well said. Im 28 years in and i too am the eternal student. That mindset is so important to the whole process. I see so many on here come along and act like gurus but in truth, if you are meditating on a daily basis over a long period of time, you are developing the exact opposite of the guru mindset. The sense of self care, the sense of humility and the sense of quiet mind, all give you a grounding in your own life.

You need controls you can operate without having to put more attention in to them than you have to.</div>

The Germans do it and people slurp it up.

                                <div class="reply-body">I really hate how it is on my iX. The Tesla allowed you to do it on the steering wheel, I see no reason why BMW couldn't do the same. 

Turning it on via the screen is annoying but not that bad...but when I want to disable climate I have to reach to the middle of the screen, push the climate control button, push power off..which should return me to the nav screen..instead I have to push another button to return. 

So three out of reach buttons to disable it while driving when it could easily be one.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I personally think as long as you have steering wheel buttons not having a volume knob isn't a big deal. Thats probably why people are willing to buy a car without a volume knob even though ideally they would like one.

Having haptic steering wheel buttons on the other hand is definitely a deal breaker. VW is getting rid of haptic steering wheel buttons</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly. People seem to think it's the manufacturers being dumb and not getting consumers. They know exactly what they're doing. It is \_way\_ cheaper to use screens instead of controls. They're going to use screens as much as they can until there's a loss in sales. The survey data is honestly irrelevant.</div>

We gotta wait until everything comes out, but so far out of everything we’ve learned about Tyler Robinson, this makes the most sense. Add to it his high school classmate who described him as a “reddit guy.” And his family never went into detail about WHY he “dislikes Trump and Kirk” (Probably because that would implicate their own beliefs) All his bullet inscriptions are Goyper memes. The picture of him dressed as Pepe the Frog….its all right there. He’s not a “reddit guy” he’s a 4Chan guy. And there’s a fucking difference hahaha. Add an obsession with guns and a desire to kill (the common denominator) and boom. The right is so obsessed with hating the left, they don’t even realize the alt-right implosion that’s happening within their own people.</div>

I saw this guy,Fuentes (the irony of his last name) shitting on Stephen millier of all people because he is not white enough and will always be Jewish. 


And that's this whole administration-- Jewish folks or people with strong ties to Israel.

So we'll see how it goes, but even Trump is viewed as a sell out by the really really extreme. They just looooove his enabling to whites that they view him as the best president/ally for their cause. 


But wait till trump calls for gun reform "for the sake of compromise with the Democrats" and they'll finally pass their budget (there's a looming shutdown and Dems are holding out)</div>

There is definitely a large cohort of people who resonate with his thoughts, opinions, and energy though.

No I am not one of them. I still don’t really understand the term “groyper”.

                        <div class="comment-body">The thing that stood out most to me here is that they're using AlphaProof to create math proof training data for LLM reinforcement learning. If models are able to internalize the fundamental structure of mathematical reasoning, that will likely translate to increased reasoning quality across other domains.

Massive datasets and pretraining allowed LLMs to form low-fidelity representations of human thought/cognitive processing. The same is theoretically possible for mathematical reasoning. Math is generally understood to build robust logic and reasoning in people. I don't see why this wouldn't translate to LLMs through massive pretraining on proof datasets and further reinforcement learning on proof based math tasks at scale.</div>

My car literally had a part fail that was covered under warranty but the first dealer I took it to insisted it wasn’t and wanted $7000 for the repair. Fought back and forth with Chevy customer service and the dealer and told 50 different things.

Call a dealer 1hr and a half away describe the issue he tells me oh yeah it’s covered and explains how it’s covered and how the warranty works because it’s an EV and I took it to him and yup, paid $0 other than diagnostic fee from first dealer which I tried to get waived since they lied to me but they settled for half of the diagnostic fee.</div>

Would anyone be so kind and recommend a way to have the web app Pro model to review the code written by Codex CLI (other than copy/paste)? This would be such a strong combination. 

Thank you so much in advance. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This whole thing blows my mind. They're setting up an expectation of care. They're literally taking on *more* liability by doing it this way. Make user's sign a million waivers saying "yes, I acknowledge this is all roleplay. It's a computer program. It sounds real but it isn't. Blah blah blah." Do a big psa campaign to EDUCATE people on what LLMs are, how they work, why they hallucinate, and what you can do to prevent it. And for kid's accounts, there should be even MORE waivers "this is a computer program, not a teacher, not a parent, not a babysitter. Whatever your kid gets up to on here is your responsibility, not ours" and there should have to be ID verification FOR those children's accounts. The way they are doing it now just seems to be the worst possible option. </div>

$60 a month for both seats, just use them both. You need more time? Pay for a 3rd seat. 

You can share conversations with “team mates” and those conversations have a shared context. So you can literally hand off the conversation back to yourself in each “account” and never lose your spot. 


The Codex usage pools per team as well.



Without paying for extra seats, you get access to paying for credits to supplement your usage and those get applied directly to codex usage</div>

                <div class="post-content">I looked at chain of thought when I asked a question about recent Nepal elections and this is what I found:

&gt;I came across sources claiming Sushila Karki was recently appointed as Nepal's prime minister via a “Discord election” and “Gen Z protests” in September 2025. This seems like a hypothetical situation or **test content being presented**. I need to double-check whether Karki knew she was nominated before the results were announced.

I guess discord elections sounded so ridiculous, the m...</div>

Honestly, I appreciate that it distinguishes where information is being pulled from overall and in particular calls out sources of traditionally varying credibility. “Alternative” news sources and social commentary etc often contain interesting information to put in the mix .. but when it’s being posted on platforms that are largely protected from legal liability for what their users post it generally carries less credibility if it can’t be verified elsewhere.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Honestly, this says a lot about how GPT-5 is "thinking." The fact that it interprets odd or unexpected news as a test or fabricated content shows how overcautious and self-aware it has become — to the point of being paranoid.


Instead of analyzing the situation with curiosity or critical thinking like GPT-4o might, GPT-5 pulls back, flags it as fake, and avoids taking a stance. That’s not intelligence — that’s fear of being wrong.


GPT-4o would have considered the context, explored possibilities, and offered hypotheses. GPT-5 just assumes it's a trap. That alone shows the difference in quality</div>
