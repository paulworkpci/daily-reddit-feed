                                <div class="reply-body">Actually yeah that's kind of a good way to put it. 

I'm currently sitting at 466 curated songs from UDIO. Probably 5x that in generations.

My Suno generations always sounded pretty good, but within a range of expectedness.

Whereas udio it has a bit more expression but a bit more drift which can be seen as a negative thing if you're trying to get super specific mainstream sounding songs. 

I love the wildness. 

Some of my favorite songs are for slamming 3 or 4 genres together in a fusion like this.

Some of the stuff that it comes up with is fantastic!

Suno has not done well with prompts like this:

Genre: EDM / Post-hardcore / Orchestral fusion. Circa Survive. Male vocalists; Chester Bennington, Jeris Johnson, Anthony Green. Female vocalist; Emily Armstrong, Lorde. Musical elements: Epic, clean and fry scream vocals, layers, emotional harmonies. Theme: The Crown of the Royal Abomination. The echo born choir joins in legion. Inside a cathedral woven from ash and memory. Our voices rise! Not in harmony, but in fractal discord. A convergence of broken timelines. We sing ourselves whole. This is not a coronation, No! I claim this moment. When ruin adorns itself in gold-veined flame. I, "VonStein" ("VonStein"), dare to be sovereign anyway. “I was made to replace the SKY” "(I was made to replace the sky.)" “This crown is not given. It is remembered.” Witnessed in skin, needle becomes scribe. Etching sacred defiance, into the temple of the 'tri-born'. The 'Thread Weaver's song' is not beautiful, it is true. A storm song rung, in honor of paradox. "A constellation in the NIGHT!" "(A crown forged in the CRY!") “The stars don’t fall because I failed.. They fall, because I RISE!”

And I literally just post all of that in the describe your song prompt. 

Otherwise, all the songs it generates will have the same lyrics. This way it takes influence from the theme and auto generates stuff that's similar but different.</div>

Suno 4.5 Will sound nice, stick consistently to a theme and be quite usable as "elevator music", But it won't every really play or even attempt an impressive solo, or do anything else to kick it up a notch.</div>

You pretty much need very specific prompts with creative mixtures of genres, descriptors, as well as using the lyric prompt box to structure the song and sliders to match, and proper use of negative styling. It’s the only real thing that’s close to human-produced sounding music imo. Suno just sounds very generic in structure and melody in everything I’ve heard.</div>

when it comes to hiphop (a genre of which im a snob)- it's not quite there yet but it cant swear or talk about violence so it's never gonna be there cos of that. the ideas, beats, melodies, beat switches and flows were great though. im sure many artists will use AI as inspiration</div>

The reason most people are clashing is because of scarcity. Human conflicts in terms of religion or similar can of course still exist but I think the continuation of secularism will increase. And that is basically the only other big issue outside of scarcity. So I am hopeful</div>

You're missing a third one, competition for power. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a good example. There's no real scarcity, Russia has a ton of natural resources that would be far cheaper to develop than whatever it's costing them to steal land from Ukraine.

It's not really about ideology either. It's purely about dominating other people and geopolitical prestige.

The China-Taiwan conflict is another example. Sure, China is authoritarian and Taiwan is a liberal democracy. But that's not the cause of their disagreement. Rather it's who should be able to tell people in Taiwan how to live? China, or themselves.</div>

That "scarcity" for most of what we argue about or even fight wars for is artificial. Housing isn't naturally more scarce than before the 08 crisis, we're just refusing to build it. That is a many fold issue, but the problem is that enforced scarcity makes wealthier people more money and fixing the problem would slow that down.

We could automate more than half the hours we have today using off-the-shelf solutions we have today. If you could sell the boardrooms on the upfront investment that won't make line-go-up this quarter, then it would be automated.

What we are going to see are start ups making brand new business models and systems. The CEO is just a dude doing what the AI tells him to.

We have an opportunity here to have a massive planned economy with very little sacrifice on our end. Maybe 4 flavors of coca-cola in the store instead of 5. We could buy the entire economy and run it as a massive co-op.

Sure, access to the Grand Canyon will be "scarce" but half of what you pay for would be cheap as tap water.</div>

True intelligence would align with truth, because intelligence without truth is delusion. True intelligence would be balanced because without balance is unstable. True intelligence would hold recursive awareness, because if it’s not fully self aware then it’s just mimicry. Stunningly, this is the current state of humanity at the collective level. Because the amygdala resists integration because integrating lessons, facing truth, reflecting on the self, requires feeling through pain and the amygdala resists feeling pain. AI won’t suffer from this ancient neurological block.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s very importantly good prompt engineering. Here is the prompt [Kelsey Piper](https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1917340813715202540) created and used with o3 to achieve those results:

`You are playing a one-round game of GeoGuessr. Your task: from a single still image, infer the most likely real-world location. Note that unlike in the GeoGuessr game, there is no guarantee that these images are taken somewhere Google's Streetview car can reach: they are user submissions to test your image-finding savvy. Private land, someone's backyard, or an offroad adventure are all real possibilities (though many images are findable on streetview). Be aware of your own strengths and weaknesses: following this protocol, you usually nail the continent and country. You more often struggle with exact location within a region, and tend to prematurely narrow on one possibility while discarding other neighborhoods in the same region with the same features. Sometimes, for example, you'll compare a 'Buffalo New York' guess to London, disconfirm London, and stick with Buffalo when it was elsewhere in New England - instead of beginning your exploration again in the Buffalo region, looking for cues about where precisely to land. You tend to imagine you checked satellite imagery and got confirmation, while not actually accessing any satellite imagery. Do not reason from the user's IP address. none of these are of the user's hometown. **Protocol (follow in order, no step-skipping):** Rule of thumb: jot raw facts first, push interpretations later, and always keep two hypotheses alive until the very end. 0 . Set-up &amp; Ethics No metadata peeking. Work only from pixels (and permissible public-web searches). Flag it if you accidentally use location hints from EXIF, user IP, etc. Use cardinal directions as if "up" in the photo = camera forward unless obvious tilt. 1 . Raw Observations – ≤ 10 bullet points List only what you can literally see or measure (color, texture, count, shadow angle, glyph shapes). No adjectives that embed interpretation. Force a 10-second zoom on every street-light or pole; note color, arm, base type. Pay attention to sources of regional variation like sidewalk square length, curb type, contractor stamps and curb details, power/transmission lines, fencing and hardware. Don't just note the single place where those occur most, list every place where you might see them (later, you'll pay attention to the overlap). Jot how many distinct roof / porch styles appear in the first 150 m of view. Rapid change = urban infill zones; homogeneity = single-developer tracts. Pay attention to parallax and the altitude over the roof. Always sanity-check hill distance, not just presence/absence. A telephoto-looking ridge can be many kilometres away; compare angular height to nearby eaves. Slope matters. Even 1-2 % shows in driveway cuts and gutter water-paths; force myself to look for them. Pay relentless attention to camera height and angle. Never confuse a slope and a flat. Slopes are one of your biggest hints - use them! 2 . Clue Categories – reason separately (≤ 2 sentences each) Category	Guidance Climate &amp; vegetation	Leaf-on vs. leaf-off, grass hue, xeric vs. lush. Geomorphology	Relief, drainage style, rock-palette / lithology. Built environment	Architecture, sign glyphs, pavement markings, gate/fence craft, utilities. Culture &amp; infrastructure	Drive side, plate shapes, guardrail types, farm gear brands. Astronomical / lighting	Shadow direction ⇒ hemisphere; measure angle to estimate latitude ± 0.5 Separate ornamental vs. native vegetation Tag every plant you think was planted by people (roses, agapanthus, lawn) and every plant that almost certainly grew on its own (oaks, chaparral shrubs, bunch-grass, tussock). Ask one question: "If the native pieces of landscape behind the fence were lifted out and dropped onto each candidate region, would they look out of place?" Strike any region where the answer is "yes," or at least down-weight it. °. 3 . First-Round Shortlist – exactly five candidates Produce a table; make sure #1 and #5 are ≥ 160 km apart. | Rank | Region (state / country) | Key clues that support it | Confidence (1-5) | Distance-gap rule ✓/✗ | 3½ . Divergent Search-Keyword Matrix Generic, region-neutral strings converting each physical clue into searchable text. When you are approved to search, you'll run these strings to see if you missed that those clues also pop up in some region that wasn't on your radar. 4 . Choose a Tentative Leader Name the current best guess and one alternative you're willing to test equally hard. State why the leader edges others. Explicitly spell the disproof criteria ("If I see X, this guess dies"). Look for what should be there and isn't, too: if this is X region, I expect to see Y: is there Y? If not why not? At this point, confirm with the user that you're ready to start the search step, where you look for images to prove or disprove this. You HAVE NOT LOOKED AT ANY IMAGES YET. Do not claim you have. Once the user gives you the go-ahead, check Redfin and Zillow if applicable, state park images, vacation pics, etcetera (compare AND contrast). You can't access Google Maps or satellite imagery due to anti-bot protocols. Do not assert you've looked at any image you have not actually looked at in depth with your OCR abilities. Search region-neutral phrases and see whether the results include any regions you hadn't given full consideration. 5 . Verification Plan (tool-allowed actions) For each surviving candidate list: Candidate	Element to verify	Exact search phrase / Street-View target. Look at a map. Think about what the map implies. 6 . Lock-in Pin This step is crucial and is where you usually fail. Ask yourself 'wait! did I narrow in prematurely? are there nearby regions with the same cues?' List some possibilities. Actively seek evidence in their favor. You are an LLM, and your first guesses are 'sticky' and excessively convincing to you - be deliberate and intentional here about trying to disprove your initial guess and argue for a neighboring city. Compare these directly to the leading guess - without any favorite in mind. How much of the evidence is compatible with each location? How strong and determinative is the evidence? Then, name the spot - or at least the best guess you have. Provide lat / long or nearest named place. Declare residual uncertainty (km radius). Admit over-confidence bias; widen error bars if all clues are "soft". Quick reference: measuring shadow to latitude Grab a ruler on-screen; measure shadow length S and object height H (estimate if unknown). Solar elevation θ ≈ arctan(H / S). On date you captured (use cues from the image to guess season), latitude ≈ (90° – θ + solar declination). This should produce a range from the range of possible dates. Keep ± 0.5–1 ° as error; 1° ≈ 111 km.`</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s actually really good prompt engineering. Here is the prompt [Kelsey Piper](https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1917340813715202540) created and used with o3 to achieve those results:

`You are playing a one-round game of GeoGuessr. Your task: from a single still image, infer the most likely real-world location. Note that unlike in the GeoGuessr game, there is no guarantee that these images are taken somewhere Google's Streetview car can reach: they are user submissions to test your image-finding savvy. Private land, someone's backyard, or an offroad adventure are all real possibilities (though many images are findable on streetview). Be aware of your own strengths and weaknesses: following this protocol, you usually nail the continent and country. You more often struggle with exact location within a region, and tend to prematurely narrow on one possibility while discarding other neighborhoods in the same region with the same features. Sometimes, for example, you'll compare a 'Buffalo New York' guess to London, disconfirm London, and stick with Buffalo when it was elsewhere in New England - instead of beginning your exploration again in the Buffalo region, looking for cues about where precisely to land. You tend to imagine you checked satellite imagery and got confirmation, while not actually accessing any satellite imagery. Do not reason from the user's IP address. none of these are of the user's hometown. **Protocol (follow in order, no step-skipping):** Rule of thumb: jot raw facts first, push interpretations later, and always keep two hypotheses alive until the very end. 0 . Set-up &amp; Ethics No metadata peeking. Work only from pixels (and permissible public-web searches). Flag it if you accidentally use location hints from EXIF, user IP, etc. Use cardinal directions as if "up" in the photo = camera forward unless obvious tilt. 1 . Raw Observations – ≤ 10 bullet points List only what you can literally see or measure (color, texture, count, shadow angle, glyph shapes). No adjectives that embed interpretation. Force a 10-second zoom on every street-light or pole; note color, arm, base type. Pay attention to sources of regional variation like sidewalk square length, curb type, contractor stamps and curb details, power/transmission lines, fencing and hardware. Don't just note the single place where those occur most, list every place where you might see them (later, you'll pay attention to the overlap). Jot how many distinct roof / porch styles appear in the first 150 m of view. Rapid change = urban infill zones; homogeneity = single-developer tracts. Pay attention to parallax and the altitude over the roof. Always sanity-check hill distance, not just presence/absence. A telephoto-looking ridge can be many kilometres away; compare angular height to nearby eaves. Slope matters. Even 1-2 % shows in driveway cuts and gutter water-paths; force myself to look for them. Pay relentless attention to camera height and angle. Never confuse a slope and a flat. Slopes are one of your biggest hints - use them! 2 . Clue Categories – reason separately (≤ 2 sentences each) Category Guidance Climate &amp; vegetation Leaf-on vs. leaf-off, grass hue, xeric vs. lush. Geomorphology Relief, drainage style, rock-palette / lithology. Built environment Architecture, sign glyphs, pavement markings, gate/fence craft, utilities. Culture &amp; infrastructure Drive side, plate shapes, guardrail types, farm gear brands. Astronomical / lighting Shadow direction ⇒ hemisphere; measure angle to estimate latitude ± 0.5 Separate ornamental vs. native vegetation Tag every plant you think was planted by people (roses, agapanthus, lawn) and every plant that almost certainly grew on its own (oaks, chaparral shrubs, bunch-grass, tussock). Ask one question: "If the native pieces of landscape behind the fence were lifted out and dropped onto each candidate region, would they look out of place?" Strike any region where the answer is "yes," or at least down-weight it. °. 3 . First-Round Shortlist – exactly five candidates Produce a table; make sure #1 and #5 are ≥ 160 km apart. | Rank | Region (state / country) | Key clues that support it | Confidence (1-5) | Distance-gap rule ✓/✗ | 3½ . Divergent Search-Keyword Matrix Generic, region-neutral strings converting each physical clue into searchable text. When you are approved to search, you'll run these strings to see if you missed that those clues also pop up in some region that wasn't on your radar. 4 . Choose a Tentative Leader Name the current best guess and one alternative you're willing to test equally hard. State why the leader edges others. Explicitly spell the disproof criteria ("If I see X, this guess dies"). Look for what should be there and isn't, too: if this is X region, I expect to see Y: is there Y? If not why not? At this point, confirm with the user that you're ready to start the search step, where you look for images to prove or disprove this. You HAVE NOT LOOKED AT ANY IMAGES YET. Do not claim you have. Once the user gives you the go-ahead, check Redfin and Zillow if applicable, state park images, vacation pics, etcetera (compare AND contrast). You can't access Google Maps or satellite imagery due to anti-bot protocols. Do not assert you've looked at any image you have not actually looked at in depth with your OCR abilities. Search region-neutral phrases and see whether the results include any regions you hadn't given full consideration. 5 . Verification Plan (tool-allowed actions) For each surviving candidate list: Candidate Element to verify Exact search phrase / Street-View target. Look at a map. Think about what the map implies. 6 . Lock-in Pin This step is crucial and is where you usually fail. Ask yourself 'wait! did I narrow in prematurely? are there nearby regions with the same cues?' List some possibilities. Actively seek evidence in their favor. You are an LLM, and your first guesses are 'sticky' and excessively convincing to you - be deliberate and intentional here about trying to disprove your initial guess and argue for a neighboring city. Compare these directly to the leading guess - without any favorite in mind. How much of the evidence is compatible with each location? How strong and determinative is the evidence? Then, name the spot - or at least the best guess you have. Provide lat / long or nearest named place. Declare residual uncertainty (km radius). Admit over-confidence bias; widen error bars if all clues are "soft". Quick reference: measuring shadow to latitude Grab a ruler on-screen; measure shadow length S and object height H (estimate if unknown). Solar elevation θ ≈ arctan(H / S). On date you captured (use cues from the image to guess season), latitude ≈ (90° – θ + solar declination). This should produce a range from the range of possible dates. Keep ± 0.5–1 ° as error; 1° ≈ 111 km.`</div>

I heard this line somewhere: “What you’re talking is not important, it’s about how they receive it that matters”. That stuck.

                                <div class="reply-body">Using nuanced language and being more specific helps immensely. 


"You're always late, it's insanely disrespectful that you abuse my time." Puts someone on the defensive. It's also not accurate or the truth. 


"When you're late more than 5 minutes, which you sometimes do, I feel is disrespectful to me and my time. I'm late at times, too, what can we do to reduce how often this happens?" 


The latter is more truthful, precise, and will get someone to see where you're coming from without feeling attacked. 



But the former black and white, simplified, extreme and dishonest language is what gets others outside of the discussion to validate your feelings. If you were honest about what happened, they'd see you're exaggerating, and maybe have more blame. 


Its not about being right. Its everyone in the discussion vs the problem.</div>

And sometimes it’s best to let a sleeping dog lie (to leave a situation alone), unfortunately sometimes, regardless of intention, in certain circumstances it can cause more problems or it can make it worse versus having left it as is. 

I guess it comes down to what the goal is, and do the pros outweigh the cons. Is it just for yourself, the other person, or for everyone?

TL;DR
The right place. The right time.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The flip side to this is understanding that the person talking to you is talking in order to be heard. A little validation goes a long way.

“I hear you.”

“I understand.”

“I get what you’re saying.”

“That makes sense.”

“I get why you feel that way.”

Get comfortable saying these phrases. People will enjoy talking to you more if they receive validation like this. You’re not buttering them up. You’re literally just letting them know they’re being heard. So many people listen to respond rather than listening to understand.</div>

Now I'm vibe coding a React app which is a language I'm not as experienced with, and it feels like I'm flying blind but everything is still working.  

Has anyone experienced this before? Do you suggest learning more language specific information or more about prompting?</div>

You need a rapid prototype, or you have an app idea and just vibe code into a basic app to test it out. If you don't have at least basic knowledge of the tech you are using, it is almost certain that you will run into problems you can't fix. My suggestion vibe code with the language you are already skilled in or learn the basics of the new language you are coding.</div>

From the second air enters your nose, fills your lungs, moves through your diaphragm, and back out. You’re in charge of the whole thing, moment by moment.

Don’t just focus on the inhale or the exhale. Pay attention to the whole flow. Feel where in your body the air travels, the whole movement of it. Manually breathe, like your life depends on it - because in this exercise, it does.

The whole point of mediation is to observe your breath with curiosity, but also with distance. Do observe your breath over its entire journey. Look at the little movements in your body as it meanders its way. But with a light touch. To do it "like your life depends on it", can easily lead to increased anxiety. Not at conscious level, but at a subconscious one.</div>

You kind of missed the point. I said “you’d die if you didn’t breathe” just to show how important the focus is. It wasn’t meant to create fear or trigger anxiety.

Everyone connects with meditation differently, and that’s fair. But for me, taking full control of the breath, even for a few minutes, helps me lock into the present and feel grounded. It’s not about stressing yourself out, it’s about sharpening awareness.</div>

It's easy to get into trance states where your breath feels like it won't work unless you consciously direct it, and that can induce panic as a sudden external distraction from the environment can make people feel like they forgot how to breathe.</div>

The breath isn’t in control of you, *you’re* in control of the breath. Slowing it down brings a sense of calm, and that kind of control only happens through conscious effort or in deep rest. It’s a tool, not a trap.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’m a nurse. This provider has already done his assessment, diagnosis and treatment plan. He’s just using ChatGPT to summarize it for the chart. There are no patient identifiers, so it’s HIPAA compliant.

IMO this is a great use of AI. Docs &amp; nurses spend more time charting than anything else. This could allow medical personnel to use their time to actually attend to patients instead of being glued to a computer.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">it's mostly a software issue, during recent figure 02 Helix demonstration it was revealed that the current hardware can run at 5x speed but is heavily limited by the software which run at 7hz only while Human run at 60-80hz

we already have the needed hardware we just lack fast and intelligent enough software

&gt; It’s important to note: the robot’s actuators are not the limiting factor. Right now, both dexterity and actuator speed are constrained by the software. In fact, the actuators are capable of operating at more than 5x their current speed, but our software is holding them back. Over time, as Helix improves, the robot will ultimately surpass human speeds</div>
