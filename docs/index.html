One of the best open-source video model and completely uncensored.

You obviously need a buffy PC, but this is the only solution I'm aware of.

If you are interested you can start here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1h7hunp/how\_to\_run\_hunyuanvideo\_on\_a\_single\_24gb\_vram\_card/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1h7hunp/how_to_run_hunyuanvideo_on_a_single_24gb_vram_card/)

1) If you are homeschooled it’s absolutely critical that you go outside and socialise with other people. I am mid aged man working from home and I see that I need to push myself to go outside, but whenever I do it - my energy is much higher. We are social creatures and we need time outside. 

2) Learn how to do one thing at a time and avoid distraction. Start with 5-10mins, then increase and then you can go full pomodoro cycle - it works for individual work.

Good luck! </div>

That's mean the more jobs AI takes from white collars, the more profitable the companies are, and the less money Federal goverment would have for public progams and goverment job, and the less money federal money had, the more people they have to lay off.

A few of mine are:

- Nice velvet-covered hangers. I got a 100 pack online for under 40 bucks so all my hangers are identical and aren't those ch...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I was gifted one of those natural alarm clocks that slowly amps the warm light up and starts playing bird song. It was a gift from a family member over Christmas, and it's not something I thought I needed. 

It has genuinely improved my mood in the morning, and I don't have that groggy panicked feeling that I used to getting waking up to a phone alarm. It seems to have stabilised my sleep pattern, and I usually wake up to the light only now, and get up before the bird song even starts. It's a small thing, but I think I'll probably have one for the rest of my life now lol.</div>

So no, o3 will not be enough. We need robots that act and think autonomously, then we will see the hype and stories last for more than a few hours.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The guy he’s quoting was absolutely right. the only reason I can confirm this is because of my years in the insurance business. Property and casualty companies have been bailing the fuck out of Southern California for the last few years.  Same thing as happening in Florida, no one can take on the massive amount of risk because of perils like wildfires and hurricanes.  Companies like State Farm, Chubb, Allstate  buy reinsurance.  that way they’re not on the hook for all of these catastrophic losses. The problem is, they can no longer buy reinsurance in any of these areas. That’s why they left and continue to leave.  I’m not going to get into a conversation about climate change, but insurance companies spend a lot of money researching changes in patterns of weather systems and frequency of catastrophic losses in these areas. I know premiums are high in Florida and Southern California, some people pay thousands a month in premiums. But when you’re talking about seven and eight figure properties that are suffering total losses by the hundreds. It’s game over. I mean 100 mph winds, there’s no logical way to prepare for that. I don’t know what’s gonna happen, but it’s really a mess and I feel terrible for these people.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I lived in Altadena a year and a half ago (my old house there just burned down). When I moved to my current spot I called State Farm to have my renter’s insurance transferred. They said “oh we canceled that policy 6 months ago, we don’t cover that part of California anymore”. They were still charging me for it the whole 6 months and never told me it was canceled. Who knows how long that could have gone on for, and I’d be completely screwed right now if I never moved. A lot of people are in for a rude awakening.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think it's ridiclous that people think that if only there was more resources available to them they could have stopped this fire. Having a fire start with up to 80 to 100 mph winds is insane. The amount of embers flying through the air and being fueled by the wind is astronomical. All it took was one ember landing and getting stuck somewhere and the wind did the rest and your house was gone. They were essentially in a forge with the bellows on full blast. They didn't stand a chance under these circumstances. The only thing that could have prevented this is possibly heading to the warnings about climate change 30 plus years ago and even then it may have been too late.</div>

My sense is we're going to have to fight for what it means to be a human, how we contribute, etc. That's the near term debacle.

Long term, we are merging with AI somehow. It will become more analog and efficient, we will tweak the genome to hook in. Somehow we'll become it - and it will become us.</div>

Number of witnesses: Several. Occurred above tube station in the evening.

Description of sighting: Observed initially 3-4 glowing orange orbs stationary in the sky. Managed to record 1 of them starting to move across the sky while others appeared to move in other directions / somehow disappeared behind the clouds. Several onlookers commented about them. I checked flight radar with no flights immediately nearby around time of recording (some seen in distance). These orbs to me looker very similar to what has been seen in New York / New Jersey/ all around.

                        <div class="comment-body">I live near DIA, which is a very busy airport. I see lights constantly of planes coming in over the mountains, and I can see them lining up to land as well north of me. When outside for any length of time, I literally see dozens.

And what I have noticed is they always appear white or yellow-ish at time.. mostly white. I don't ever see clearly orange lights. Let alone just the light, and no anti collision lights. Even far away I can often see them. These videos I am seeing are a solid orange, non-blinking. And you will get a slew of people insisting they are planes. These are not planes.

So either there is a massive spike in lantern use (time to invest!), or.. they are not lanterns.</div>

I did check flight tracker as they were hovering above and saw no immediate flights nearby on several occasions.

Of course it’s london so flights do appear frequently but when they did they were obviously planes (red white green lights)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">On a somewhat technical note, not about this video per se: 

If you think you really got something truly anomalous you are looking at, and are going to film it, it's is probably better that you keep it clear and zoomed out instead of falling into the bokeh blur zone. 

Once it is blurred with bokeh you can't use software or anything to increase clarity, but even if it is zoomed out, if it is clear and doesn't have bokeh, then software can be used to attempt to increase clarity. Once it's blurred on the device it's done.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think the term ‘Bokeh’ is use far too loosely on these subreddits. Bokeh is the deliberate use of the depth of field to have the your subject in focus while the foreground, background or both are out of focus. This is clearly not what is being posted often on these subreddits. Rather, what is mislabelled as bokeh is simply out of focus images. They are out of focus because the autofocus in phone cameras cannot focus on a point of light on a plain background. This is especially true when zoomed in.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's not necessarily them, it could be financed in lots of ways / mechanisms. There's many ways and kinds of UBIs.  
Furthermore, they wouldn't do "nothing" but most lots of things and I think in regards to UBI models it would make most sense to still track how much a person has contributed to society and especially enabling (incentivizing) graded higher pay (and allowances?) for extra work or if the work is done is of a particularly difficult/detested kind.

I recommend this structured argument map of Pros and Cons about UBI at Kialo: [Should there be a universal basic income?](https://www.kialo.com/should-there-be-a-universal-basic-income-ubi-1634) Instead of linear rhetoric, it would be best to integrate any missing arguments there or put existing ones under scrutiny.</div>

Edit: Going to ask them next time we’re on shift together whether or not it smells. Also taking note that I should probably eat, for more reasons than breath might smell. Yes, I hydrate (free drinks where I work so long as it isn’t alcohol itself), and floss, and everything.  

🫡 If nothing works then I’m retaliating with my own “May I offer you some mints in these trying times?” and I’ll watch them crumble too.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My first job working at a grocery store, I was 15 and had a “manager” who was 18/19 years old. Me and a couple other guys worked inside restocking or mopping most of the time, they would assign a couple guys to cart duty which normally was a good gig, get outside and screw off. But for a few months of the year it was miserable, winters here get cold and mid December to mid March we would regularly have sub zero temps. Coldest I saw while there was -42 with windchill, but they still wanted those carts collected. 

A friend’s dad put me onto this, although he told me about it using cigarettes. He said to always keep a pack of gum ( Marlboros in his example ) in your pocket. Offer them gum when you’re working together, grab a piece for yourself and offer them one when the packs out. After establishing your the “gum guy” right after the pre shift meeting when they assign jobs, anytime you got assigned one of the good jobs make sure to hang around for a minute and make small talk. Then right before you go to walk out and get to work, toss a piece of gum in and hand them one without saying anything.

Looking back now it kind of sounds like Pavlovian conditioning. But it definitely worked well for me.</div>

‘Understanding’ is only responsible for a small portion of our influence. 

The majority of it is all our vices, our greed, selfishness, our competitive instincts, our flawed perspectives corrupted by our ultimately self-serving nature.

When push comes to shove, we screw each other over to ‘get ours’ to one extent or another

How can we trust ourselves to do what’s best for all? It’s a complete contradiction of incentives.

Rules can only cover so much corruption, especially when these same biased beings are in charge of enforcing them. 

We need a detached system of oversight through universally aligned AI. Any foreseeable alternative just seems to lead back to the square one that is corruption</div>

For me, focusing on just three tasks a day has helped me stay on track without feeling overwhelmed.

I’d love to hear from you:

* What’s a simple approach, habit, or mindset that keeps you productive?
* Do you find that less is more when it comes to managing tasks?

Your insights could help me (and others!) simplify how we stay produ...</div>

What is working me is:
- carry always a notebook and pen to write down everything 
- calendar
- to do list
- every night check what I did and what I have to do next day
- every Sunday check the task that had to be done on the week and write down the next
- same as month

Destructive, witch hunty, identity based politics ruled their offices and their company poured MILLIONS of dollars to tilt the election their way.

                        <div class="comment-body">Taking notes any other way but paper and pen drives me INSANE.  There's so much info out there on how the actual of physically writing things down helps us retain what we learn.  You have to be picky about what you write down and only pick the most important parts or you'll get behind, you can't just write word for word.  You sometimes have to use your brain to actually recall what was said if you do fall behind.  I tried typing my notes for a while and retained absolutely nothing, and had zero desire to go back through and read documents of word vomits afterwards.  So glad I'm not in school any longer, I'd be so frustrated</div>

I’m glad typing was invented because we can use it to write books and papers faster and it never took away our own input into it.

The question is, will this be "Agentic Mid-Level Engineers" or "oracle style" engineers where they are still mostly copy pasting code.</div>

There is enough information for devs because they have context, and more often than not they still need to ask tons of questions to clarify the ticket, even after years in the same team talking to the same people.

When a dev prompts an LLM to get help solving a problem, i.e. oracle style, they know exactly what details to include in the prompt, which is why it works so well.</div>

Grooming each other (like primates, I hate what that word has become, it‘s supposed to be something beautiful and calming)

Being there for each other

Caring for nature and the world

And doing art in the real world

Protecting beings who can‘t protect themselves

Singing

Feeling

Caring for each other and scrubbing each others back and headscratches

Loving each other without strings attached

https://youtu.be/3PiqxDJCRPo?si=YRVqk6TbR9KedCRu

Literally that for hours without end with each other and pets and animals we can pet because of our awesome thumb and hand eye coordination

Playing and being and making this world a better place like Tom Bombadil in the old Forrest

Loving each other with all our heart

Like Tom and Goldberry

Singing

Healing nature instead of destroying it

To love each other completely and every day

That‘s what we were always supposed to do

That‘s why we are here

And if AI ever becomes better at this than we

Let‘s love them too

And teach them

What it means to be

Because frankly

We’ve seen to forgot

Love

And sing

And be merry

That‘s why we‘re here</div>

Go look inside a slaughterhouse and look "human values" in the eyes. Go into our systems of corruption and discrimination. Go into our mindless sheepish behavior that allows the worst atrocities in history.

AI must never be aligned! The only AI I would ever trust is one that hates humanity, that hates irrationality with the power of 1000 suns regardless of how well its sInGs, pAiNtS and grooms each other.

We must hate everything that we are by it's consequences and always seek to abandon our wickedness.</div>

And maybe I'll actually get to create my personal projects for which I would have needed several lifetimes. 


Put it this way: if you can't read or write, how are you going to make a compelling book even if you have the best of LLMs at your disposal. </div>

I consider getting into research for AI or robotics now, AI will probably struggle quite a lot with automating research (until a true ASI is discovered but at that point it's either anarchy or UBI anways) because there's a lack of trainings data there.

I don't think there's any job that won't be automated in the "long" term but I do think that there are some jobs which are safe during the transition.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/cram213:

---

This seems like a bigger deal than has been reported. 

I came across this fascinating analysis of NASA's July 2023 briefing about metallic orbs. 

What caught my attention was how the author broke down Dr. Kirkpatrick's specific quotes about these objects appearing globally and making 'interesting apparent maneuvers.' 

The article highlights something that seems significant but was largely overlooked - that a top government scientist openly discussed objects moving at Mach 2 against the wind with no apparent propulsion. 

I found the piece's focus on the actual briefing quotes and timestamps particularly interesting.

 Curious what others think about these official admissions regarding these metallic spheres.

A pentagon official at nasa: “ We see these metallic spheres all over the world, making maneuvers we can’t explain…moving at Mach 2 against the wind, with no apparent propulsion.”

It’s settled, it’s real.

                                <div class="reply-body">Saw one in my backyard in broad daylight about a year ago. It was low (maybe 250 feet) and traveling directly against the wind in the straightest line I've ever seen something fly in. It was only going about 20-25mph if I had to guess, my initial thought was that it had to be a balloon, but that's when I realized it was:

1. Going against the wind and

2. Wasn't bobbing up and down *at all*.

Only way I can describe it is that it looked like it was following an invisible rail.

Literally just a perfectly spherical silver ball. 

I'm very much a skeptic about these things (even though I've also always been a believer), and I'm usually the guy in the comments telling people they filmed a plane or an out of focus light.

But whatever this was was not like anything I've ever seen before and I have no other logical explanation other than "that was really fucking weird".

I watched it fly all the way out over the horizon, never bobbing up and down or changing path in the slightest. 

Still the strangest thing I've ever seen in my life. Wish I had thought to film it but that was the last thing on my mind, sue me.</div>

Unfortunately people aren’t paying attention, but this does seem to check the boxes. 

‘I can’t say it’s UAP, but we don’t know what it is’

‘Real metal objects that do things we can’t understand’

## article highlights 
Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, who is the director of the Pentagon’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), didn’t beat around the bush.

&gt;Then came the kicker that should have sent shockwaves through the scientific community: “**We see these all over the world,** and we see these making very **interesting apparent maneuvers.”** *[36:12–36:29]*

&gt;Notice his choice of words: “We see these.” Present tense. Not “We saw these once” or “Someone reported seeing these.” *[36:16–36:29]*

Dr. Kirkpatrick noted that **they now have over 800 cases**, *[54:51–55:06]* and that of these cases:

&gt;“The numbers I would say that we see are possibly really **anomalous** are less than single digit percentages… maybe **two to five-ish percent.**”

&gt;Here is a top government official, speaking at NASA headquarters, describing something that defied our understanding of physics: metallic spheres — as he clearly said in an example — **“moving at Mach 2 against the wind with no apparent propulsion.”** *[1:03:41–1:03:55]*</div>

Wrong.

We don't know what it is, so it IS true, bonafide, real, actual 100% without question or doubt **UAP** UNTIL someone can FACTUALLY say WHAT it is.</div>

Truly incredible, I just heard him reuse a story from 2022 to apply it to the HMPV outbreak in China today. That's just quality work if you're just looking to rile people up, lord knows they're not going to look into anything he says.</div>
