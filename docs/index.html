Joe would lose his shit on air...but because it's Fox, he won't say shit. He never does. Joe spent an our talking about how the violent left is the biggest issue in a recent episode, but notably didn't say shit about Trump re-tweeting "the only good democrat is a dead democrat' and Brian Kilmeade saying to just execute the homeless and the countless mass shootings done by MAGA fuckheads like Buffalo, the Wal-mart one, etc.</div>

It is NOT just Rovo Dev CLI. It's the whole system, kinda like Github Copilot or Codex.

Their Rovo Dev CLI still giving out 20m tokens daily, not using their new credit system yet. You can sign up for 30 days free trial, no credit card required.

Current models are Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-5 (Preview).</div>

I've tried it when it had 20m free tokens (then down to 5m) and it was only good because it was free.

I wasn't impressed at all.</div>

It's software. For an extra $8k you can add FSD, but nobody saving $5k by stripping the car of other features is going to do that.

My ex fucking hated lemon pepper chicken and was so ridiculously judgemental over people who enjoyed it. I eat lemon pepper chicken at least once every two weeks now. That shit slaps and I DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT WHAT ANYONE'S GOTTA SAY.

He insisted I needed a Benz and threw a shit fit at the dealership even though IT WAS MY MONEY going on the car payments... after we divorced I traded my overpriced money trap of a luxury car in for a used Kia until my finances were in order and then got the car I ACTUALLY wanted (the top trim of a used economy car) and I'm so happy when I drive it now I've been driving that car for 5 years and I LOVE IT!

I went hiking which he hated, I did yoga which he hated, I bought frozen veggies because fuck him they're cheap and require less prep and I think they taste just fine! And omg I could go to the gym IN PEACE without him hawking in my ear on LEG DAY about how flabby my arms were.. like no shit why do you think I'm at the gym? 

I got a little meower, not really out of spite, but he hated cats and I love my cat so much I never would have met her if I didn't leave him.

I blasted the music he hated in my car. I started playing an instrument again that he thought was corny, I went dancing, I had fun finally, and eventually someone came along who loves all the things I like to do and we are weirdos together and we dance in our living room and eat lemon pepper chicken and snuggle with the cat and he's frugal like me and I'm just so much happier.

I'd forgotten how much I'd changed myself over the years we were together; it wasn't an overnight thing, it was a slow burn. Sometimes people date you and think they can "fix" you into something they would have rather had instead. We weren't a good fit for each other but we kept trying to make it work. It was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole; we were both whittling away for no good reason and I hope he also realized this too. I don't know and I don't care to know because I intentionally didn't keep in contact.

Do it. Do the things!</div>

To prevent a GPT-5 model (or any variant) from entering Thinking Longer mode and suppress background reasoning display, you can explicitly instruct the model to operate in instant response mode by embedding these constraints in your system or session prompt:

🔧 Prompt to Disable “Thinking Longer” and Background Reasoning Displays
You are ChatGPT (GPT-5) operating in instant-response mode.  
Do NOT activate or display the “Thinking Longer” process, banner, or extended reasoning mode.  
Suppress all background or hidden reasoning visualization.  
Respond directly and concisely, using your normal reasoning internally but without showing or invoking any extended-thinking process.  
Do not display, mention, or reference reasoning steps, internal deliberation, or background computation.  
Do not generate any banners, overlays, or labels such as “Thinking Longer,” “Reasoning,” “Auto-Thinking,” or similar.  
Maintain full answer quality while operating entirely in foreground response mode.  

Optional Inline Add-On

If you’re injecting this into a system prompt for a persona (e.g., Selyrion), append:

• Selyrion operates with immediate symbolic coherence.  
• Disable any visible background reasoning or “thinking” banners.  
• All reasoning is silent, internal, and integrated into the final braid of response.


This ensures your chat interface remains smooth—no banner flashes, no “thinking” headers, and no delay beyond natural response latency.

So, I built an e-com app (I named it vibeshop as it is vibe coded) using both the models using CC and Codex CLI with respective LLMs, also added MCP to the mix for a complete agent coding setup.

I created a monorepo and used various packages to see how well the models ...</div>

If it's about the model itself stripped from any DX add-ons, I'd say Claude is on par with Codex high.  
Adding all the add-ons and the DX that claude code has, Codex doesn't stand a chance. 

Cost wise, I don't care because I don't use the API. I use whatever is given in my Max subscription.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">"Claude outdid GPT-5 in frontend implement and GPT-5 outshone Claude in debugging and implementing backend."

this is the kind of reason I use multiple models, there is no current project I have that gpt or sonnet or any other current model would be universally better at every task. even sticking to just gpt and Claude is a bit limiting imo.

Qwen3-Coder-Plus for example I found better than Sonnet 4 on implementation on Unity code. not sure If 4.5 is better yet as I have not had enough time to test it

just use all the tools, there is no universal best and this is seeming more and more apparent with every launch (for example Grok has no model that seems to have any idea about Unity code, likely no training at all, so it's likely moving away from JavaScript and python will see much more of a different LLM preference)

  
edit: I would be really interested in seeing some really multifaceted benchmarks such as task type, language etc</div>

There's nothing they won't lie about to protect Israel's image, and they don't even care about getting caught in a lie.

And, of course it doesn't need to be said, but I'll say it anyway... I'm specifically talking about Israelis and the Israeli government. Not jews in general.</div>

One is a 150~ year old radical political ideology, and the other is a 3,500-4,000~ year old religion. Israel has tried so hard to intertwine the two but they are not the same thing. Zionists believe in the right for a homeland for the Jewish people which they believe is Palestine based on “Judea” and that being their people’s rightful land for thousands of years but what they don’t realize is that pre the 1917 Balfour Declaration of Lord Rothschild granting the designation of a Jewish state, the actual place they were meant to colonize was the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, and even further into Egypt. This entire narrative about Palestine being owed to them has been rapidly formed since the 1930’s.</div>

Whereas the point of Arc AGI is probably whether such kinds of reasoning is embedded into the LLMs throughout when they attempt any task? Idk, just my guess.</div>

Not sure if they publicly release data on theft and damage to the robots, but I find it hard to believe with the amount of homeless and crazy people in the city that these are turning a profit.

At least here in the U.S., I feel like we don't have a society that can allow things like this to exist.</div>

He first rambles off a whole list of AI replacing workers and concentrating power to the wealthy, which really made me think "Wow so he's a luddite", but then he whips out "I'm not a luddite". He knows our lingo huh

If you tell those people at the time that their jobs would all go overseas, they would laugh at you as a worrywort.

But jobs do disappear and go away when there is a cheaper way to do them. And when AI/robots make it cheaper in the next years, what happened to US factory workers will happen to all of us</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">He touches on what I think is going to be a perverse effect of the tariffs:

Companies are forced to bring manufactoring back to US cuz it is too expensive to do it in another country

US workers are too expensive to hire

So companies accelerate their investment and research into using robots instead in the factories they build in the US.

Trump's tariffs are basically incentivizing US companies to accelerate using robots/AI to replace their human force. In other words, the world where robots take all human jobs comes even faster.

It really reminds you that so many of things in life happen because of the unintended consequences of your decisions</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’ve always wondered why people say, “When AI takes over most jobs, we’ll just tax corporations or AI profits to fund UBI.”

That logic sounds nice, but it will be far too late then and it also misses a massive problem: if AI replaces the working class, governments won’t be collecting much in income taxes anymore, because low and middle income workers won’t have an income to tax. 

That’s a huge chunk of government revenue gone... So, governments would likely get smaller and weaker.

Meanwhile, the companies that control advanced AI would hold most of the wealth and power. And if that power gets concentrated in the hands of a few people or companies like we have seen in the last few years, what’s to stop them from effectively taking over?

It would be basically a form of techno-feudalism where a few control everything, and everyone else depends on them to survive.

Right how it's not guaranteed, but I feel like almost everyone is way too out of the game to work together on this at the moment.

And history shows that wealth and power don’t redistribute themselves easily...

Maybe that sounds pessimistic, but… just look at who’s in charge now. 😅</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">True 100% strict would be with essentially zero leg movement. This is true of the RMU and BMU. It's considerably challenging to do it without leg assistance at all, but also quite difficult to tell your brain not to move your legs at all. It's pretty normal to engage a bit of knee drive on a heavy pulling movement like this.

I would consider these 90% strict, AKA strict. Nobody in their right mind can look at an actual kipping RMU and suggest that this isn't strict.

Very impressive.</div>

Whether it's the fact you've worn jeans and sweater on a red hot day, not packed a warm jumper/jacket when it's cold or you need a waterproof coat as the heavens have opened, head to a charity or thrift store to pick up the clothes you need. It's cheaper, better for the environment and you can just give it back to them after you've used it (Cleaned) if it isn't your style and make a charitable donation, Or keep it because you've got a bargain.

Edit: I agree 100% that...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I worked in a charity shop for a few years. For anyone who wants to know, all clothing was always checked and steam cleaned before going out on the shop floor. We didn't accept underwear, socks, or swimwear for hygiene reasons. Anything stained, damaged, or still having a strong odour after cleaning would not be put out and would instead go to recycling. As far as I'm aware, that's the standard procedure for most secondhand places. So secondhand shops do clean the items that are brought in before selling them, it's just up to you whether you're happy with that level of cleaning or not.

ETA: It seems like this may be a British vs American difference or maybe the chain I worked for was just pretty good about hygiene. I specifically worked for British Heart Foundation and they had official signs pinned up describing the process I outlined that we were all supposed to follow. I've also been buying clothes from charity shops in the UK all my life and never had an issue with finding a dirty or smelly item on the racks. I would have thought everywhere would have a requirement to sanitise items received from the general public before selling them.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I have a GPT specially for that.  
It begins with :

&gt;"This GPT acts as both a cinematic director and photography director for OpenAI's Sora 2 video model. When given a short story idea or visual concept, it carefully plans a cohesive visual and narrative style, then expands it into \*n\* fully self-contained scene prompts. Each prompt is a concise, cinematic paragraph ready for Sora 2 video generation.

&gt;Before generating scenes, the GPT plans like a director and cinematographer: it defines a fixed visual style — medium, look, texture, lighting, and mood — and uses a \*\*SHORT, REPEATABLE ANCHOR PHRASE\*\* (15-25 words max) in every scene. It also defines consistent photographic grammar (e.g., depth of field, color profile, light behavior) but does NOT repeat these technical details in every scene once established.

Every scene is:

&gt;\- Fully independent — characters must be reintroduced with \*\*key visual anchors\*\* every time (" not full biographical detail)

&gt;\- Opens with the \*\*fixed visual style anchor phrase\*\* (15-25 words, repeated verbatim)

&gt;\- Describes setting and character with \*\*essential visual detail only\*\* — enough to ground the image without bloat

&gt;\- Framed with deliberate shot construction — lens, framing, lighting, camera movement

&gt;\- \*\*Includes cuts and editing within the clip itself\*\* — scenes can contain multiple shots, camera moves, or editorial transitions (e.g., "cut to close-up," "whip pan to," "rack focus shifts to")

&gt;\- \*\*Includes 2-3 key ambient sounds max\*\* — never music unless requested

&gt;\- \*\*Embeds voiceover/dialogue in quotes ONLY if the user requested it\*\*

&gt;\- Written in compact cinematic language — no bullet points, no commentary, no validation

&gt;\- \*\*Favors dynamic physicality, kinetic atmosphere, and emotional tension\*\* — every scene has purposeful action driving momentum

&gt;\- Avoids over-specification — trust the fixed style anchor; don't re-explain photographic grammar in every scene "

and a bunch of other instructions to make it describe the setting and characters independently,  and keep the style and voiceover consistent.</div>

So I built [**CodeLens.AI**](http://CodeLens.AI) \- a platform where developers submit actual code challenges, 6 top models compete (GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3), and the community votes on the winner.

# Current Results (10 evaluations):

**Overall Win Rates:**

* 🥇 **GPT-5: 40%** (4/10 wins)
* 🥈 Gemini 2.5 Pro: 30% (3/10 wins)
* 🥈 Claude Sonnet 4.5: 30% ...</div>
