I've long held the stance that it's not even buzzwords, or a lack of, being the issue.  It's knowing somebody within the company that gets your application streamlined to the interview process.  Doesn't have to be a higher up, it can be anyone already working for the company, but a higher up will streamline three process even more.  I've applied to hundreds of places where I would be a great pick, did extremely well on the rare interviews I had, only to never get a call back or get an email saying they decided to go with somebody else.  I don't know anybody in my preferred field.  All my friends do something else.  A friend that works in automotive told me to apply for his company and put him down as a reference.  They wanted experience, and I had none in that field.  I applied anyway and started orientation 2 weeks later.  Maybe a month ago, some of the guys and I were standing around talking when it was slow, and one of the guys was talking about how he was dissatisfied with the company and thinking about getting another job, but said it's so hard finding work nowadays.  I mentioned my "need someone on the inside to get the job" theory, and that's when all but one of the 10 or so people that were standing around talking said that they think they only got the job we had now because they knew someone already working there.</div>

Thus they post job ads andake you jump through hoops only to reject you in the end for some obscure reason.

Basically workers in US are now competing for jobs with workers from Indian subcontinent, and similar third world countries.

And they are willing to work for way less money.</div>

TFWs.

They could hire their cousin without the ad.

But, they can't justify hiring temporary foreign workers (TFWs) without one. Companies have to show that they've "attempted to" hire locally before they can bring on the *much more affordable* TFWs.</div>

I realised this issue so I checked reddit for answers. One of them was to put the phone in another room. Now I have tried this and it didn't work 2 years ago but this time I put the phone where the reward was. For example after I finish a coursera I could go play drums or after I exercise I eat. I just wanted to share this because I'm fascinated how effective it is.</div>

I found this video on TikTok where the author asks the same question, he said he recorded it last night 12/21/2024

Could it be some kind of natural event in the sky?

We were actually out there to see if we could spot any drones, because of all¬†these sightings. Well, we found some drones. Or more accurately, they found us .

I‚Äôm terrible with measurements, but [the swarm] was about 80 to 100 feet above us. They had four propellers. Seven feet across. The flashing lights, like you‚Äôve seen. The festive green, red, and white lights, around 20 knots, which is just over 20 miles an hour. 

Commercial airplanes don‚Äôt move like that. I‚Äôve been out there when planes were coming in for landings in New York, and trust me, you can tell the difference. We‚Äôre not idiots, we know what drones look and sound like.

 I can‚Äôt pretend to know what‚Äôs going on, because I don‚Äôt, but they weren‚Äôt the types of drones you can buy at the store. These were government drones. If [the drone swarm] fired at us or engaged us in any way, we would‚Äôve fired back.‚Äù

The coast guard vessels of today have only minimal air defense capability, most with only a single dual purpose 25m or 57mm gun that could be used to shoot down a drone. None have sea-ram, CIWS or other close in defense weapon system let alone anti-aircraft missiles. Equally astonishing, Coast Guard vessels have no anti-submarine weaponry on them at all, even though they are frequently sent to intercept narco-subs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiZ8i6bfaJk)</div>

Llm is not just one entity, it's based on transformers, layering of neurons aka neural network

O series is llm + search algorithm + test time compute.

I don't get people saying , this architecture won't do.

We are already away from basic llms by gpt 4 turbo.</div>

**Rail travel (1825):**¬†‚ÄúThe gross exaggerations of the powers of the locomotive steam-engine‚Ä¶may delude for a time, but must end in the mortification of those concerned.‚Äù  
‚Äî*Quarterly Review*

**The telephone (1878):**¬†‚ÄúThe Americans have need of the telephone, but we do not. We have plenty of messenger boys.‚Äù  
‚ÄîWilliam Henry Preece,¬†Chief Engineer of the British Post Office

**Light bulbs (1879):**¬†‚ÄúEveryone acquainted with the subject will recognize \[Thomas Edison‚Äôs experiments\] as a conspicuous failure, trumpeted as a wonderful success.‚Äù  
‚ÄîHenry Morton, President of the Stevens Institute of Technology

**AC electricity (1889):**¬†‚ÄúFooling around with alternating current is just a waste of time. Nobody will use it, ever.‚Äù  
‚ÄîThomas Edison

**The automobile (1899):**¬†‚ÄúThe ordinary horseless carriage is, at present, a luxury for the wealthy; and although its price will probably fall in the future, it will never, of course, come into as common use as the bicycle.‚Äù  
‚Äî*Literary Digest*

**Planes (1911):**¬†‚ÄúAirplanes are interesting toys but of no military value.‚Äù  
‚ÄîMarshal Ferdinand Foch, Supreme Commander of the Allied Armies in World War I, 1918‚Äì20

**Sound in films (1928):**¬†‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think people will want talking pictures long‚Ä¶. Talking doesn‚Äôt belong in pictures.‚Äù  
‚ÄîJoseph M. Schenck, President of United Artists

**Television (1946):**¬†‚ÄúTelevision won‚Äôt be able to hold on to any market it captures after the first six months. People will soon get tired of staring at a plywood box every night.‚Äù  
‚ÄîDarryl F. Zanuck, Head of 20th Century Fox

**Home computers (1977):**¬†‚ÄúThere is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.‚Äù  
‚ÄîKen Olsen, Founder of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)

**Laptop computers (1985):**¬†‚ÄúFor the most part, the portable computer is a dream machine for the few‚Ä¶the real future of the laptop computer will remain in the specialized niche markets.‚Äù  
‚Äî*New York Times*

**The internet (1998):**¬†‚ÄúBy 2005 or so, it will become clear that the internet‚Äôs impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine‚Äôs.‚Äù  
‚ÄîPaul Krugman, Winner of the 2008 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences

**The iPhone (2006):**¬†‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs always asking me when Apple will come out with a cell phone. My answer is, ‚ÄòProbably never.‚Äô‚Äù

Like finding a cuddly little tiger cub--sure the potential for danger can be understood but you sure better have a plan in place by the time the big cat grows up and decides on its own to eat your liver.  

We are raising a tiger without a full understanding of what an adult tiger can and will do.

Smart people tend to look at consequences that many others don't extrapolate.</div>

For example, the creating of an outline of what is needed is very accurate, as we all already know ChatGPT is great at, but the statements like "spend an hour on this and two hours on this" don't have any supporting evidence for why that is recommended.  And if you think about it, how would ChatGPT be able to forecast the number of hours needed to practice a certain task unless someone out there has defined how long one would need to spend practicing given a certain skill level?  Due to this, I don't see this as much more valuable than just creating an outline, or curriculum, of what needs to be studied, but I would be curious if it has churned out more solid answers for some others.</div>

Like I said yesterday the term AGI is a distraction, If an AI is winning Nobel prizes in physics, coding entire applications and discovering new medical treatments are we going to say "yeah but it only got 45% on ACR-AGI v3??

We need AI that can do useful stuff not abstract useless tasks that are easy for humans to do.</div>

That's EXACTLY where I'm at as well

It's all starting to kinda lose the plot. What are we even really measuring at this point? The classic example use to be an AI that can fool a human. Even the free current models are pretty close to that, let alone o3. Now we have these more 'complex' benchmarks, and the AI keeps demolishing those as well.

So we are kinda at a point where we are playing gotcha by coming up with something it can't do, to claim it's still not AGI. Rather than accepting what it already is, we are just finding random new holes to make some arbitrary point.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">For AGI benchmarks, they are always referring to benchmarks that humans *can do*. This is why they often report the score that people from Mechanical Turk got on their benchmark.

We could solve maths entirely and still not have AGI, because AGI is a different thing to extreme skill in specific domains. Obviously that would be massively impressive and groundbreaking, but AGI is a separate thing.

"AGI" is important for different reasons that advancing technology. If you had a sufficiently capable AGI system, you could replace *a lot* of people's jobs. On the other hand, narrower forms of intelligence only affect specific professions.</div>

Do you think it's possible for someone to generate an adversarial benchmark test that *you personally* would fail but most people could easily pass? Maybe I overestimate my own intelligence but I think it would be quite difficult to generate an adversarial benchmark against me.</div>

9/11 Demolition Team

In the pictures: the preparations before. Everything was captured as part of an extended elevator renovation and art project. The BB18 connections for electrical systems/breaking the picture with the lighting for testing. This is how you create a drawing of an airplane by exploding it.

Pay attention to the commercial quantities of the bb18 boxes

LITERALLY EVERYTHING about this sentence is wrong.

The pictures were taken in **MARCH 2000**. The **AUSTRIAN** art group [Gelatin/Gelitin](https://www.gelitin.net/pages/biography) built a tiny balcony to hang outside the studio space of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council World Views program in the World Trade Center. A book about it, "The B-Thing", was published in August 2001.

Gelitin is four Austrian artists: Alexander "Ali" Janka, Florian Reither, Tobias Urban, and Wolfgang Gantner. They are not Israeli or even Jewish. They were also not students in 2001, having exhibited together since 1993. They met in summer camp in 1978. They still do exhibits together to this day.

OP has also confused Gelitin with E-Team. E-Team is two Germans (Franziska Lamprecht and Hajoe Moderegger) who teamed up with an American (Daniel Seiple) to do the project at the World Trade Center, "127 Windows". They have made group art projects as recently as ... 2023.

The "127 Windows" project was on March 29, 2001. They tried to spell out E-TEAM in lights. They did this by asking people in the building: "We contacted 14 businesses and provided them with floor plans detailing which blinds to open and close." They wanted it to look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/dy6ebTN.png), but it ended up looking like [this](https://i.imgur.com/zLlfxX6.png). I fail to understand what is threatening about trying to get people to spell "E-TEAM" in lights.</div>

AI experts vary drastically in their assessment of what AI can do today, whether they are potentially dangerous or not, and what the implications are for the world.

Why not have an independent taskforce that aggregates evidence such as studies and expert opinions? Such a meta study would be waaaay more reliable than any individual expert's opinion.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">First off, I think this is really common! I found when I was at school my brain was wired to ‚Äòget tasks done‚Äô. Ticking things off a to do list is satisfying, and helps you feel like your day has structure and purpose. The inverse of this is an open, unstructured day where you‚Äôre free to do what you like. In theory, this should be a joy! Look at all this free time I have! But I get the tendency to ‚Äòoptimize‚Äô your free time and make the most of it. My rec to you would be to start your day by going on a long walk, and setting a timer and dumping everything that‚Äôs on your mind into a list on your phone/onto paper. That way you can see all the tasks, anxieties etc that might be surfacing when you‚Äôre trying to enjoy your free time. Once you‚Äôve done that, you can review your list and mentally (or you can write) how/when you plan to tackle or resolve each item. For me, that gives me the mental space to feel at peace to take a day to rest, without feeling like I ‚Äòshould‚Äô be doing something else. From there, I would be kind to yourself and give yourself a few ‚Äògoals‚Äô, but stay flexible. Only get 1/3 things done, no worries! You can try again on your next day off. Let yourself rest! It‚Äôs okay not to be productive all the time</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I can't do the rigid bullshit other people do. It's good they are capable of it, kinda makes me insane. I don't have a phone addiction, but I do find it easy to lay around. So one day is devoted entirely to my work, which is pretty demanding. The next day I use for me, but still productive. Gym, meditation, reading, etc.

I think the big goal for days off is to make sure they are treated like you are looking out for yourself. Don't drink yourself numb, fall into vices or use crutches to make an unsatisfying life bearable.

Put time into things that will pay you back, and don't play the "will I won't I" game in your head; regardless of your choice it will make you feel like a loser.

Hope this helps some, know it's not the most practical advice.</div>

Rich people have a whole support network of other people that do their busy work for them. Mr. Richy Business doesn't have to make his own bed, or cook his meals, or clean his laundry/house/everything, he has a team that does all that for him. Us little people have to do all of that shit for ourselves and still make it in time to clock in. And then we're too exhausted to do anything with the sliver of time we have left.
