I’ve heard Elon quote Milton Friedman more than once. For the record, Milton Friedman is a fucking evil person whose philosophy is responsible for trickle down economics, the existence of billionaires, and workers around America losing their pensions and benefits. But Friedmans #1 concern was always the shareholders. You do whatever you have to do to provide for the shareholders. Usually that means lay offs. But in Elons case, it means removing himself.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, the military of every country is employed by that country - oooOOOoo socialist takeover! 

Public Sector Workers in Iran and Iraq killed roughly a million people between themselves, the public sector workers of Rome sacked Carthage, and the public sector workers of the US raised a flag over Iwo Jima as part of a slow march towards Tokyo to explain to their God-Emperor that Japans public sector workers weren’t really positioned to impose public sector rule over China and huge swaths of Asia.

Now, we used to call that shit patriotism and understand basic economics and how the actual fucking military works.  In that mode - brains turned on - you would just say “Nazi Germany” and ascribe agency to their leadership.

If you wanted to carry water for fascists and were clearly restarted? Good point.  If you care about people? stfu. 🤫 </div>

I was your age twenty years ago and everyone acted the same. It was before the computer crap was literally everywhere, but everyone wore the same clothes and had the same jokes, etc. I even remember back when GEICO had that stupid "hump day" commercial and for days the only thing kids could say was "its hump day".


But yeah I hate all the computer stuff too. I hated it in school and that was back when we just had a computer lab and the laptop cart. It was just so needlessly obtrusive and intrusive. All the adults were like "OMG we have to have all the tech bs or the students will fall behind in the digital divide." Looking back it was just them being lazy and using the computers to entertain the students.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I genuinely feel for you and people your age. I’m only about 10yrs older than you (an “elder gen z” — born 2000) and these patterns were only just beginning when I was your age but I know they’ve gotten much worse. The truth is that by the time you’re older, not having an internet addiction and possessing your own personality will be MAJOR assets that will set you apart from the rest! You’re right that sadly it’s more likely that screen addiction will only get worse, but your social life will still improve as you get older. High school is such a small pond and a lot of people are still immature. It will get easier to make friends as you grow up and venture out into the world, I promise. And as you become an adult, you also get more opportunities to make friends with people in different generations from you! Now that I’m in my mid-20s, I’ve begun to be able to date and be friends with millennials and even gen x, being an adult is amazing because you’re no longer tied to your age cohort.

It also gives me real hope that *some* teens are still tech resistant, even if only a fractional minority. You are the future, you really are. I cannot stress enough how much better off you are than your peers, and I’m glad you have two friends who also have retained their own personalities! I’m sorry that this problem is so severe that you basically feel ostracized from your peers, it’s completely unfair and not your fault. The truth is that young people are being victimized by giant tech companies that are saturating their psyches in an incredibly addictive product. Count yourself lucky that you are able to resist it.</div>

The difference between democrat and republican voters is very simple. Democratic voters can disagree and criticize their leaders choices, very few believe Biden or Kamala are perfect representatives of their wishes,, and if anything there is a bigger and bigger push in the DMC because they were not left leaning enough.

But Republican voters pretend that Trump is a god, anyone who opposes him is evil, even when he does bad they will lie and praise it. They are a cult.</div>

Also, it was originally a Heritage Foundation plan Obama re adapted with Democrats to help stop Medicare for all single payer and filter in a new way to private insurance companies.

I have never met anyone who has Obamacare as lower working class poors. It's either medicaid unemployed or employer insurance. It was just another scam.</div>

Llama was already popping out before the release of GPT4.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama\_(language\_model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama_(language_model))

The thing is that each time a new model is released, you can bet your ass that every research group, even with tiny funds, is working all around the globe to reverse engineer it.

Models aren't some sort of Manhattan project.

And the ML scientific community, as well as the IT world, are funded upon free circulation of information as a common practice and good habit. It wouldn't exist without that mindset to begin with.

Believe me, things never remain "closed" for long in the comp sci world.

10, 20, 40. 40 billion at the end of the first year.

40, 80, 160. Year 2

160, 320, 640. Year 3

After 3 years we would expect a 10 billion parameter model to be equivalent to a 640 billion parameter model released 3 years earlier. Let's go one more year.

640, 1280, 2560.

A 10 billion parameters model should be equivalent to a hypothetical 2.5 trillion parameter model released 4 years earlier.

Edit: Apparently I'm an LLM because I used 3 years instead of 2 years.</div>

It reversed aging? I hadn't heard about this one. I heard about a product from a company called LOYAL based in San Francisco that is doing huge trials for a drug that could extend the lifespan of large dogs by 1+ years and *slow* aging, expected to be released this year or next.</div>

They're mostly training it and also u can get their pro subscription for like 12 USD a year with vouchers available online which gives access to gpt 4.5, 3.7 sonnet. So I don't think it's bad at all.

                        <div class="comment-body">This is obviously excluding the fine folks here at nosurf, but for the most part, Reddit is just loser central.  I know that sounds harsh, and I'm not fully excluding myself from that label haha, but Reddit really just seems to have become social media for people who are miserable, and just not that popular in the real world.  Making smartass, condescending, snarky remarks online is the only way they can feel powerful.  It gives them a false sense of superiority, all while being safe behind a keyboard.  They would never say these things to anyone face to face.</div>

Like a lot of people, I’ve been pretty dependent on caffeine for years. Coffee in the morning, another by noon, maybe another or an energy drink in the afternoon, felt like the only way to function. But I started wondering: am I actually more productive, or a...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Honestly - almost all the negative effects of quitting coffee can be mitigated by decreasing coffee over a week instead of going cold turkey. And then make sure U get 8hrs of sleep each night. Ofc everyone is different but should work out well for most</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I honestly prefer going cold turkey because it's over faster. I find tapering just drags out the addiction and creates more opportunity for relapse. 

Works better because I get the good effects of being caffeine free faster after a few days of being very sleepy and lacking focus. I use paracetamol for the headaches if I get any.

Usually I go cold turkey when I find my schedule allows it, ATM things have been stressful and I'm low on sleep so I'm relying on coffee and tea to get through but once that lets up it's back to caffeine free for me.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I guess I was more curious about what would happen. I suppose I was in denial of how dependant I was on it. Analyzing the behaviors of my co workers and friends and family, I'm sure most people also severely underestimate their dependency and aren't mindful of it. It's really made me think how much of the anxiety, stress and sleep disorders out there could be solved if people just cut out their caffeine intake.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Posts like these are as old as time. People blame caffeine for feeling terrible, and having massive crashes, when they've failed to follow basic steps to mitigate the impact of caffeine wearing off.

As you say, if you eat well, exercise and get to bed at a decent time, then you can drink caffeine the next day and, as soon as the effect wears off, you feel fine... because you're returning to a 'normal' baseline having had a good sleep the night before.

Obviously if you go to bed really late, hardly drink any water in the morning, then eat a load of carbs and sugar at lunch time - and then have a coffee - you'll feel absolutely terrible after the buzz wears off because you're feeling the effects of all of the above on top of the caffeine buzz ending.

That's why when I have eaten terribly and slept poorly, I'll have one strong coffee in the morning to get me going - and I really struggle to have any more after that, because you're running on empty for the rest of the day.

I enjoy coffee much more when I'm feeling fit, am eating well, and have had decent sleep - you get the buzz but can then return to normal after - and have a few more cups throughout the day with very little side effects.

There's no need to go 'cold turkey' for many folk. Just drink more water, exercise more, eat and sleep well. Then coffee becomes enjoyable again.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/phr99:

Remember [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1jaa2qk/director_of_age_of_disclosure_dan_farah_was_told/)?

&gt; Director of "Age of Disclosure" Dan Farah was told by leaders of both political parties that they intend to use his film as soft disclosure. "They believe the film will become their most effective tool for educating the public and other elements of government on the truth"

And now suddenly Elizondo has been called to Washington DC to brief people in the Trump administration? Something is brewing behind the scenes. And this is just something we now know about because Sheehan casually mentions it. There is much more going on. The toothpaste is out of the tube, and we better buckle up.

                <div class="post-content">Hey everybody,
I was wondering if yall know any hobbies I could pick up on that could replace using my phone. 
I like working out, reading, and playing drums but I can’t do those for 6 hours like I can on my phone. 
I also like to go out with friends but obviously I can’t do that whenever I want. 
Any ideas? Ideally something that I don’t need to go way out of my way to do it. 
Any hobbies you guys know of that I can do for a long time, that are fun, and are mostly easy?
It can be something that...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">What helped me was to write down what i was doing on my phone after a using period, scroll hole, etc. After a bit of just noting that I could see what I was looking for when I picked it up. Was it for a temporary escape? To avoid dealing with something? To search for community, to obtain knowledge, to feel inspired? There are so many things you can "do" (theoretically) on a phone it's good to have an awareness of how that 6 hr span breaks down for you and what you want beneath your phone use. You probably aren't using in one straight stretch - maybe in the AM it's community/social vs evening escape/inspiration. Then find other activities that serve those core needs - I promise it will feel more fulfilling, even if it's smaller at first. Also, you'll retain a lot more of your own memories than if you were getting swept along an attentional deluge. Example - maybe you have an early AM phone call with a friend or a text chat with some buds that want to stay motivated about the gym. Or in the evening you start to explore films in a country you'd like to go to or find a class or run club or something.</div>

Every time I deleted the social media apps from my phone, that halved my screen time... Because I'm too lazy to open up my personal laptop, plug it in, sign in, open the browser, sign in the social media, etc... xD

Good luck!</div>
