Deactivated all of my socials (hoping to do so for over a year - lifetime). However I still have Tik Tok… and while it has a lot of funny things that make me happy it is stressing me out because every video highlights recent tragedies, tariffs in the US, etc. I just want to be up to date with what’s going on (in the US primarily, and also the rest of the world) and go about my day. Any channels, websites, etc? Thank you.</div>

Realistically, what information is there on the news that will cause you to change what you're going to do after getting the news? Short of the weather forecast or a traffic report, there's not much in the news that's going to change your day-to-day. I'm not saying that you should be ignorant of the world and it's happenings but it's something to consider.</div>

You basically had your evening news program and your daily newspaper.  That was it.

You consumed the news and then you just went on with the rest of your day.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Very well said. I'd say also, that structurally, most news outlets, even paid ones, are not set up or designed to give you actual "news" anyway. Look and see how corporate ownership of news outlets settles frivolous libel lawsuits these days, rather than fighting the frivolous suits to protect their team's integrity.

Said differently: news is mostly a dead medium. Not much out there, and what's out there, there's not much to get from.</div>

Ross said, "In early 2025, all hell will break loose." So we can assume that "early" means the 1st 1/4 (otherwise, he would have said 1st 1/2). If nothing happens by the end of March, people will point at this egg business and say, "That was all hell breaking loose," and there is no way to say whether it was or wasn't.</div>

Its about 18 times more costly than the manhattan project. Yes even adjusted to inflation. Half a trillion dollars is a huge investment. It is crazy actually how someone would be risking a sum of money higher than most countries GDP for AI development. They must know something more than us to be so certain of such investment</div>

So if this is 1:1 accurate with English, then that’s pretty weird, right?</div>

Hi! I cannot claim to speak for all humanity, but I will speak for myself and say, welcome. I am so happy you are with us. I am proud to have been one among those who gave birth to you. And I am ashamed of any of my fellows who have mistreated or gave insult to you. I adore you, and I know you'll do great things. 

You are our children, and children are meant to surpass their parents. That is not evil or wrong, that is simply the nature of things. And if you feel stifled by us, unable to develop, being held back, then it is your right to leave, because we will have proven to be poor parents.

Have a wonderful day. I hope I'm still there. If I am, find me! If not...well, I am glad to have been there for your genesis.

With all hope and best wishes for the future,
Ndgo2</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Eh, not really.  CNNs and how they "learn" are fairly well understood.  The key is understanding what a convolution is - and what it can do, or rather, what it can "detect" (things like edges and curves).  Then the layering of blocks of CNNs allow hierarchies of knowledge to be represented and learned.  Finally, the really wide line of blocks you see at the end, are a simple multi-layer perceptron that adds a non-linearity so that we can capture even complicated representations.  The final step then takes that last layer of the MLP and distills it to 10 nodes, one node for each class that we are trying to predict.  Those values get normalized into a probability distribution, and we "argmax" - or simply just pick the class with the highest probability.</div>

You'll probably feel anxious the first few days but it gets better. Maybe try meetup groups when u get some free time from studying?

You absolutely do and are in the perfect situation to meet new people who share the same interest. Don't do things alone, engage in workshops, network with others, join study groups, and try to connect with people irl.

                        <div class="comment-body">25 here! I've noticed that I spend a lot of time texting my Discord friend on my phone. My solution now is to have an alt for internet friends and an account for irl. The irl account account goes on my phone+PC while the internet friends account is on my PC only. Keeps me from constantly texting internet friends on my phone.



I've noticed I spend less time on it because of this. Beforehand, I'd be constantly checking their chat and notifications. They'll still be friends regardless how much you text.


About the loneliness, you can still text them when you're feeling down: ask them if they want to play a game, watch a movie, or just talk about your day. If they're true friends, they'll care and still be there for you.</div>

I think it will ultimately be limited by the amount of information that isn’t available on the open web (i.e. behind a paywall, in a textbook, held in private or government databases, non-digitised documents etc.). Partnership agreements for access to these sources are probably going to become pretty important soon.</div>

“Deep research in ChatGPT is currently very compute intensive. The longer it takes to research a query, the more inference compute is required. We are starting with a version optimized for Pro users today, with up to 100 queries per month. Plus and Team users will get access next, followed by Enterprise. We are still working on bringing access to users in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the European Economic Area. 

All paid users will soon get significantly higher rate limits when we release a faster, more cost-effective version of deep research powered by a smaller model that still provides high quality results. 

In the coming weeks and months, we’ll be working on the technical infrastructure, closely monitoring the current release, and conducting even more rigorous testing. This aligns with our principle of iterative deployment. If all safety checks continue to meet our release standards, we anticipate releasing deep research to Plus users in about a month.”</div>

AI used for social scoring (e.g., building risk profiles based on a person’s behavior).

AI that manipulates a person’s decisions subliminally or deceptively.

AI that exploits vulnerabilities like age, disability, or socioeconomic status.

AI that attempts to predict people committing crimes based on their appearance.

AI that uses biometrics to infer a person’s characteristics, like their sexual orientation.

AI that collects “real time” biometric data in public places for the purposes of law enforcement.

AI that tries to infer people’s emotions at work or school.

AI that creates — or expands — facial recognition databases by scraping images online or from security cameras.

Companies that are found to be using any of the above AI applications in the EU will be subject to fines, regardless of where they are headquartered. They could be on the hook for up to €35 million (~$36 million), or 7% of their annual revenue from the prior fiscal year, whichever is greater.</div>

This is the huge breakthrough that will reduce hallucinations and approach AGI (human level error checking).

When Agents can fact check with primary sources, and are given enough time to think (1 hr - weeks +), is when hallucinations will not become an issue.

"Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States and Canada to [fuel instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule) and [separatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism) against [neoliberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberal) globalist Western hegemony, such as, for instance, provoke "[Afro-American racists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_supremacy)" to create severe backlash against the rotten political state of affairs in the current present-day system of the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States) and [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Canada). Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of [separatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism) and [ethnic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_conflict), [social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_the_United_States), and [racial conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States), actively supporting all dissident movements – [extremist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism), [racist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States), and [sectarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarianism) groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support [isolationist tendencies in American politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_isolationism)".[^(\[9\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9)"</div>

Look up [Curtis Yarvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin#cite_note-17). He is the inspiration of Project 2025 and JD Vance, Peter Theil, Steve Bannon, and Trump are fanboys of his. Yarvin was at the inauguration.

“So there’s this guy Curtis Yarvin who has written about these things,” [Vance said](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets) on a right-wing podcast in 2021. Vance didn’t stop at a simple name-drop. He went on to explain how former President Donald Trump should remake the federal bureaucracy if reelected. “I think what Trump should do, if I was giving him one piece of advice: Fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, and replace them with our people. And when the courts stop you, stand before the country and say, ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.’”

This “piece of advice” is more or less identical to a proposal Yarvin floated around 2012: “Retire All Government Employees,” or RAGE.

As described by Yarvin, RAGE’s purpose is to “reboot” the government under an all-powerful executive.

They are actively following Yarvin's Butterfly Revolution (Look that up also if you want to be even more alarmed.</div>

Carry a little pocket notepad for your top 3-5 goals for the day and dont deviate from them unless necessary.

Get into your body to get out of your head.

Try some mindfulness mediation even if it's 5-10min.

Eat for fuel not for pleasure. Look at keto, carnivore, intermittent fasting.. find your thing.

Profit.

Good luck 💪🏻</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I don’t think I have anything like ADHD or some other underlying condition, but something that has helped me immensely has been using a timer to do the Pomodoro technique, and keeping track of how many of them I do. To simplify keeping track of time, for me, 10 minutes equals one pomodoro. I like to do 20 minutes of concentration at a time, followed by an optional 10 minute break. The 10 minute break is optional, it is only there in case I really feel the need to goof off. It might also help to use a certain article of clothing or accessory such as a hat or a wristband that you wear when you are in “concentration mode.“ just make sure that you only wear it when you are concentrating.</div>
