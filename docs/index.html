Could be to continue the friendship, or to maintain a good civil working atmosphere in an office.

Hashing everything out is dangerous, cause a lot of people don't understand NOT bringing everything up. Brainstorming is for people you are currently working with well.

I learned early on, this conversation IS NOT about winning. It's about one issue. And, we shouldn't be digging deep down to figure out how to hurt the other person or people.</div>

It'd be hard to apply OPs tip to this situation. When your goal is to get out of the friendship. And your draw the line minimum is the same. It's not really a conversation. There's no room for the other side to have an input and offer/request concessions.

Now if you're on the fence or want to try and repair the friendship that's a different story. 

Either way, I hope the best for you. Even if it's the right move it always feels bad leading up to ending a friendship.</div>

I don't know, maybe I have a weak back, I don't seem to have any serious posture issues though, but sitting with a straight spine always leads to high tension either in lower back or in the lower part of the ribcage, which usually leads to tensed breathing (for example, I just did a meditation ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There is a certain minimum amount of muscular tension necessary to maintain a straight spine without support, of course, but it shouldn't be seriously uncomfortable. I would guess that you're just straining too hard to keep your back straight. I notice that a lot of people who are starting sitting meditation seem to initially interpret "keep your spine straight" as "extend your spine as much as possible" until they get used to how an relaxed but upright posture feels. 

Since you're a singer, I would say "sit so that your breathing is as open as possible" rather than "sit with your spine straight". That's more likely to bring you to the right place.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">As a side note, the Buddha probably suffered from a herniated disc (or several) and had severe back problems from about the time he was 60, so the last 20 years of his life. 

He didn't complain much about it but it happened. As he got older it was well known that he needed some support for his back if he was going to sit for any length of time as it is clear from suttas that such a seat was prepared for him as he got older. 

He did also meditate lying down. On his right side, it is said. It also happened that while he was supposed to sit up and teach or talk to somebody, his back was hurting too much and he lay down and handed over the talking to Ananda. On those occasions it did happen that the old man fell asleep. This is an image of the Buddha we've forgotten. 

If meditating lying down works for you then I say you're fine. I fall asleep way too easily if I lie down. I generally sit fairly comfortably too. 

There's a lot of struggling going on with the posture. Keeping your spine straight, sitting in full or half lotus pose, or for that matter the idea that it's somehow necessary to sit crosslegged on the floor. I wish I'd taken the advice of wiser people and just bypassed all of that. 

The Buddha's instruction is simple. He does say to sit down crosslegged (but does not go into detail of any particular way of doing this) with the spine erect. Now, he was living in India at a time when chairs were basically unheard of. Translated to modern times he was simply saying to sit up comfortably.</div>

Right now I practice meditation daily sitting in the Burmese pose. It's a very good sitting posture but when I started meditation I did so sitting on a chair and I still remember the good sits I had. Sitting in the Burmese pose does require less effort for me atm somehow. A poster above said it well, the body locks into position by itself in a comfortable way. Should I get old and require a chair again then that's good too.

Maybe just try going until you get uncomfortable and switch to lying down?</div>

Didn’t really do any regular compound lifting or Olympic lifting. 15 years later I’m walking around 185lbs, still run 6-7 min miles for distance, squat upper 300s, DL lower 400s, snatch mid 200s, clean and jerk high 200s. Still do class regularly. Never a competitor level. I’d be your average better guy at any gym. Wear basically the same clothes, larger shirts. Was it “CrossFit” or just getting around fit people, learning, and being consistent year over year, definitely. But that’s not the environment I was going to find in a “traditionally” gym.</div>

Every new thing has a cost of your time that has to be considered. And the field moves so fast you can sit tight until gpt 6 or Claude 5. Gemini 3 should come to cli very soon. That will be worth adopting.</div>

It's no different than when people fake. Hate crimes against themselves to control the narrative. 


Criticism of Israel, genocide, apartheid politics, racketeering black, male and control of United States policy by foreign entities, and financial crimes are not a judgment against a religion or an ethnicity of people and are *NOT HATE . 


The idea that being anti-zionist is the same as being anti-jewish is a matter of propaganda used to empower Zionism</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">They've been accused of similar for a long time.  To quote [Thomas Paine](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1053035-the-character-of-moses-as-stated-in-the-bible-is)

&gt;&gt; Among the detestable villains that in any period of the world have disgraced the name of man, it is impossible to find a greater than Moses, if this account be true. Here is an order to butcher the boys, to massacre the mothers, and debauch the daughters.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Let any mother put herself in the situation of those mothers, one child murdered, another destined to violation, and herself in the hands of an executioner: let any daughter put herself in the situation of those daughters, destined as a prey to the murderers of a mother and a brother, and what will be their feelings?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; ― Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason

Paine was referring to the passage:

&gt; *"Have you allowed all the women to live? ... Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man, but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man."*    
&gt; -- [Moses in Numbers 31:13–18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_the_Hebrew_Bible#Numbers_31)

Seems even then, they traveled into other cities, got offended by local religions, and rather than directly address the one pharaoh they were mad at, Moses told them to respond by raping and murdering innocent children...      
... all while wondering why the native people didn't like them.

So exactly the playbook in Gaza now.</div>

"Hey, we should do coffee" or "hey, we should get together some time" and others like that are performative and equally vague. **This kind of ambigui...</div>

It has been nice talking to you for this brief moment, and I fondly remember the days when we were able to hang out more, and truthfully I would love to hang out sometime and catch up and reminisce about those days, but I am really busy with all of my current responsibilities, and I know you are too, so I know we are unlikely to make time to get together in the immediate future, but the door is always open.</div>

But your examples don't really fit. If I say to you "Hey, we should do coffee", I'm hoping that you'll respond positively to that, which essentially gives me permission to then make a specific plan. If instead I just jumped to, "Hey meet me at Coffee Shop X at 10am on Tuesday", it would be weird and offputting since I haven't even indicated whether I would like to meet you for coffee or if I even drink coffee.</div>

Funny thing is, there was a roadster foundation series which would be one of the first 1000 cars to roll off the line. To book that, you had to pay the full 250k beforehand and they actually all sold out lol. A lot of people just gave tesla a 250k 6 year interest free loan.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Years ago I made a free YouTube Video Summarizer and it was pretty popular in its time.

It's easy. You paste a YouTube URL and it spits out a blog-style summary of the video. 

You can then actually chat with the video content....</div>
