In particular, see the section "What's different about o3 compared to older models?"

Yes, LeCun is probably being overly strict in his definition of an LLM. And the people who are simply scoffing at LeCun are being dumb for not acknowledging the significance of the differences between o3 and prior models.</div>

You walk up, write your to-do list, and get ready for another productive day.

You are extremely motivated and will make this day your best.

50 minutes in, and you feel exhausted and stop working.

You open Instagram to take a rest.

After a while, you realize this 10 minute break turned into a 6 hours marathon.

We all have been there.

Imagine you could walk up and ACTUALLY finish your To-Do!

You work for 50 minutes, take 10 minutes of rest.

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean it’s funny to make the “infinite money glitch” jokes but realistically they had like 120 individual investors last round, 90 this round. Likely bigger companies invested no more than $500m and more likely between $50m-$100m. So investing $100m and having the company turn around and spend like $3.5b of that raise on your products is just a good investment. 

The funnier thing about this that people are missing is AMD is also an investor. So AMD is giving them money just to turn around and spend it on their competitor.</div>

Submission statement 

  
This is all fresh in my mind and I'm still trying to process what happened.



During the evening of the 16th of December I noticed a strange glowing object hovering towards the back of my house. I live in the countryside in the South of England (Wickham), and behind my house there is nothing, no buildings, no street lights, it's just a large grassy area / field where I often walk my dog.



The object in question was circular or orb shaped, and was very bright to the point where my eyes couldn't focus on it. It reminded me of when you look at a star through a telescope, it's slightly clearer but you can't make out what it is due to the amount of light being emitted. 



Due to it happening at night my IPhone camera did a terrible job at picking it up. The object made no noise, and the only reason I knew it was there was because I let my dog out for her evening toilet before bed, and it was in my line of view as I opened the backdoor. The whole encounter lasted I would say around a minute, if I had let my dog out in the garden a few minutes before or after I would never have seen it.



About 20 seconds after initially spotting it I noticed that it appeared to be dripping a molten-like metal onto the ground. After doing this multiple times it started moving left in the sky, and after this it vanished from sight due to moving behind the large Oak trees on my property that are around 40 feet in height. (I'll try and highlight this in one of the images, I've also adjusted the brightness to help highlight the object as it's quite difficult to make out .)



I came upstairs and updated my husband about what I had just seen, and he suggested that the next morning we should head out into the field behind our house with his metal detector. 



It took a while but we started finding clumps of metal like materials that looked as though they had been fused and heated at an extreme temperature and then cooled. The items also appeared multilayered. 



Shortly after the sighting, there were helicopters in the area, we could hear them from our bedroom flying over our house so we knew they were close, however I will say that living in the South of England there are multiple military sites, so not sure if that's a correlation.



I've never seen anything like this before, and the whole encounter probably lasted no more than 60 seconds as the object was constantly moving the whole time.



My question is what did I see? Is it common for UFOs to drip metal, or could this have been something different? Is it worth sending these metal things off somewhere to get them tested and if so where would I send them, a university?



Thanks

                <div class="post-content">For the last few years I was mostly addicted to YouTube and spent hours on it every day. Lately I've been listening mostly to background music at work and I have the last 6 youtubers in my subs.

Everything doesn't seem to give me anything anymore, thousands of channels on how to make millions, reaction videos, depressing videos like the crisis of relationships, housing, economy, stock market etc. 

Everything has been said 100x times over on youtube and there's no need to watch much more stuff ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">We jumped the content shark some years ago. The problem is that the cost of content creation is roughly zero now, so everyone can put the dumbest recycled garbage up without almost no effort. It reminds me of all the recipe sites where you have to scroll through someone’s life story to learn how to make potato soup. YouTube just happens to be the poster child. 

I used to watch it a lot for music videos and music in general. I also liked stuff dealing with history and cars. I don’t remember when I finally just quit looking at it, maybe once Covid started and I started subscribing to streaming channels. Wasn’t a deliberate choice, just really gravitated elsewhere.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">When I was in the 4th grade, we had to write a short (obviously because 4th grade) essay on where we'd run away to after reading a book where the protagonist ran away.

My classmates provided examples like the treehouse down the street, grandma's house, best friend's house, etc.

Me? Costco. I argued in my essay that I could easily disguise myself in the rafters, and live off the free samples. When I couldn't get enough samples, it would cost me only $1.25 for a hot dog and a drink, which I'd happily eat multiples of, and given my savings I could sustain myself for a few months.

When the teacher was grading our papers at her desk, at one (probably mine, although that didn't occur to me at the time), she just started laughing so hard she started crying. 

When she was saying goodbye to me at the end of the day she told me she loved Costco too, and I was like, "RIGHT?!" When she walked me out to the car she told my mom she had a "Very creative and resourceful daughter." Apparently at open house that year she spilled the beans to my mom and years later I learned I made her day, but for real, I was 1000% serious.

Edit: As pointed out by u/suburbanmire, the book was "From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler." And now I'm feeling such nostalgia, TYSM!

Edit 2: since my mom died, I've realized she saved a TON of my written work from grade school. Next time I visit my dad I'm 100% going to see if she saved this essay. Honestly, it was one of my best and most memorable argumentative essays, growing up.</div>

[https://youtu.be/MBHGlRrUoKk](https://youtu.be/MBHGlRrUoKk)

The following compilation is a compilation of videos uploaded from November til December 21st. There are many similar videos that reflect similar enough phenomena to warrant that there are recurring patterns. With how chaotic social media is with everyone posting all kinds of nonsense, people mistaking planes for drones, people posting things to get attention… it becomes very difficult to get an accurate picture of all that’s happening. That is why I think, analyzing all the data at once and finding the patterns is the best way to find truth. 

To analyze data on this scale, we’ve got to stay open-minded. Being open to all information helps us spot patterns and uncover insights we might otherwise miss. If we start shutting things down too quickly—like leaning too hard on Occam’s Razor…. we risk overlooking connections or possibilities that could lead to real breakthroughs. Keeping an open mind lets us see the bigger picture and approach the data without bias, so patterns can show themselves naturally.

At the same time, we’ve got to stay grounded and logical. Like I mention in another post below, we need to build a solid dataset by sorting out what’s legit and what’s not. By combining an open mind with a clear, methodical approach, we can dig deeper into the data and get closer to the truth.

I need help though… If you notice any more recurring patterns in the footage you encounter and eyewitness accounts, let me know. I’ve read the whole morphing thing from quite a number of eyewitness accounts for example and we then also have footage that can potentially validate that is what some people are seeing… 

The following patterns are patterns that I have observed so far in all the footage I’ve seen and eyewitness accounts I’ve read:

**Variety of colors**: Red, Orange, White, Blue, Green &amp; can change color

**Formations**: Allign into formations 

**Plasma**: Look/behave like plasma

**Collisions**: Collide seamlessly into each other 

**Self Replication**: Seem to self replicate

**Morphing**: Seem to morph into objects

**Streaking trails**: Seem to leave behind streaking trails of light, resembling meteor showers

I say seem because we still don’t fully know. Who knows, maybe all camera tricks or cgi but we won’t know if we don’t analyze all the data. I think there is enough footage of these particular patterns being all posted around the same time to warrant further investigation. Being close minded will only deter you from properly analyzing data. 

If you notice any other patterns, please do share. 

PS: This compilation video is my first one. I hope to be able to cite all of these sightings and find their original posts. They are all not in New Jersey and actually span quite a number of states. This has already taken me countless hours to compile together. Along with all the links and citations in the OP. This has been draining work. So I hope to make better videos with citations. This video was mainly done to show everyone that there are recurring patterns worth investigating and to push forward quickly because the disinformation out there is insane . </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I believe skepticism is extremely important. There is a lot of bs being posted online and the lack of cohesive narrative on the subject makes it hard to follow. So I welcome skepticism and it is important in our path forward. But I think we are past the point that this is a big ‘nothingburger’ and to think otherwise, is actually ignorant. 

The repeated breaches of highly secure military bases, from Langley last year to at least 12 U.S. installations in the past month, involving drones that evade advanced radar, fighter jets, and countermeasures, cannot be dismissed as illusions or trivial. If thhese were domestic black projects, they wouldn’t be flaunted with lights, disrupting operations, and prompting public confusion… militaries conduct tests in controlled secrecy, not by alarming their own personnel and risking diplomatic fallout. And when they conduct them secretly, they aren’t flashing lights in the sky announcing they’re there and doing so for over a month while gaslighting the public that ‘nothing is going on.’

The lack of any consistent explanation from officials, combined with direct acknowledgments of ignorance and contradictory statements, further underscores that this isn’t routine. Whatever these objects are, their behavior—provoking visible resgponses at the highest security levels while remaining unexplained—clearly points to something far beyond ‘standard procedure’. We, the people should demand answers and not just sit idle and comfortable with being fed lies. 

If these incursions are just mundane drones or misidentifications, why are they consistently breaching some of the most secure military bases on Earth, evading all countermeasures, without any plausible explanation from those in charge? Where are the arrests?

If this were a U.S. black project or contractor test, why would they intentionally disrupt military operations, shut down runways, and publicly label these objects as “unidentified,” instead of keeping the tests classified and contained?

If skeptics believe this is mass hysteria or optical illusions, how do they explain the consistency of reports from trained military personnel and advanced surveillance systems across multiple countries and continents?

I’d like to know your answers to these questions. I’m not here screaming ‘ALIENS,’ it’s just clear something is going on and we’re being gaslit into believing that nothing is happening.  

There are also many skeptics here acting in bad faith.. with 1 month old accounts, just posting ‘its just a plane’ on videos that clearly don’t look like a plane and having a number of people like those posts for social proof. If you look at their post history, it’s typically just relentlessly ‘debunking’ each video with little to no definitive evidence showing they were debunked. They’re more than likely just trolls or… maybe disinfo agents. We shouldn’t be close minded to that possibility. 

So don’t bother answering those people or getting discouraged by them. Always check those accounts before answering them to determine if they’re bad faith actors. You’ll be surprised with how many of them are out there. 

Now, there are certainly people that are interested in what’s going on and debunk videos in order to rule out certain possibilities to get better data. I think we should welcome that. At the end of the day, many of us want to get to the bottom of this and we will do so by gathering and verifying data. 

I write this so that the people out there who’ve recorded videos, will still post them. I have noticed people throughout social media saying they’re discouraged from posting videos because of the  trolls insulting them the moment they’re posted. Do not get discouraged. All data is useful at this moment. </div>

And yes, you’ll note (and I’ve said this a few times here) that the gov is never conflating what is happening in Jersey with Langley and the UK bases. They phrase it “we believe the sightings in New Jersey are non-anomalous, regular aircraft and not a danger to citizens.” We need a reporter to tie this back to the sightings at the bases - the Gov has already said those are drones of unknown origin — so then why should we believe the ones over Jersey are known?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Really great post. I myself am a big skeptic and still think the most logical explanation for things is usually our own domestic military, a foreign military, some kind of private contractor, or even some type of natural phenomenon that we just can't explain.

I'm also very reluctant to just say "Aliens!" when there's something strange in the sky.

But you're spot on by pointing out that no matter what it is, it's a bad look on the governments that are just allowing drones/UAPs to fly around their most secure bases unchecked.

We either have a huge security risk and could be in big trouble if things get violent or they are not telling us everything (which is kinda always the case to be fair)</div>

Seems like that would be a major conflict of interest For anyone working the court, prosecution, or anything against. Especially because we’re seeing directly how news and events in the case are directly impacting the stock market.

                                <div class="reply-body">I suspect we will be disappointed by o3. That is not because o3 isn't impressive, but because the expectation was set by o3 using thousands of dollars of compute whereas the version available to the public will only be able to use pennies of compute.


For most of 2025, the public versions of o3 will not be that much more useful than o1. We will likely have to wait until later 2025 for performance improvements to lower the cost to see o3 at its best. 


Even still, for many tasks o1 already does an excellent job. Many of things o1 can't do, o3 can't do either. So the set of common uses that people want that o1 can't do, but o3 can is small and most people won't encounter them.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly, I wonder if it has more to do with the collective unconscious and that we, the masses, actually being these things into fruition. Especially in the 90s, EVERYONE watched the Simpsons. Millions upon millions viewing the episode at the exact same time, thinking the same things. The Stanford institute did some research into this with their random event generator, I believe they called it. It was a machine that basically put out random pulses in stereo, sometimes left sometimes right. The box was designed to be impenetrable to electromagnetic frequencies. And it indeed almost all of the time put out random signals, except when taken to events such as concerts where everyone there had one focus. During these times the pulse was no longer random. The researchers found this interesting and the went back and looked at their data. There were a few other times when the box was just sitting in the Stanford basement putting out it's pulses, yet there were a few non random times. Two of these were a) when the OJ Simpson trial first aired on television, and b) when the verdict was given. All of America was watching both of those things. So I theorize that, whether Groening and co are actually meaning to predict the future or not, that they are indeed setting it into fruition with everyone watching and thinking the same thing. 

If anyone is interested in the Stanford institute stuff or collective consciousness in general, there's a great book called The Field that goes into it in depth.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">First thing that came to my mind too, mostly because it is irreversible. Once those fat pads are gone, they are gone forever. 

We’re already seeing the effects of out of control Botox and filler use, but both of those are generally considered reversible. Perhaps not 100%, but significant improvements can be made if something has gone wrong. 

Buccal fat removal ages people so significantly (at least to me), and it’s all people in their 20s and 30s getting it done. As they age they will kick themselves for removing fat, as without that fat they are going to see deep lines and wrinkles much sooner and much more pronounced. No amount of filler or other surgical procedures will be able to replace the fat they had removed, and I worry they’ll all end up looking sick from their face being artificially gaunt (or freakish from whatever attempts may be made to try to restore the appearance of buccal fat).

Edit to add: I’m not here to argue with people about how reversible buccal fat removal is or isn’t. As a physician and a human with functioning eyes, I am of the opinion that even if there are options to “reverse” it in the future, it’s never going to look as natural or attractive as if someone didn’t get all of that work done. Surgeries involve scars and faces show imperfections very plainly. If you’re convinced otherwise, good for you, maybe go discuss that elsewhere.</div>

Her eldest daughter recently gave testimony on how growing up in an influencer family contributed to the abuse of her and her siblings and how there should be laws and such in place so that kids couldn’t be pawns on their parents YouTube accounts. I’ve never followed any parental influencers in depth but based on what I’ve read about the case I don’t get how there aren’t already laws in place.</div>

The kids can’t consent. They should be able to choose for themselves when they become teenagers.</div>

Unless your plan is to marry a robot, having another person you are already tied to will be helpful in every AGI scenario from terminator to utopia.

And obviously he's best buds with guys like Elon and Dana white who are the epitome of a greedy capitalist.</div>

EU economies are all stagnant and have been mired in regulations to the point where AI products are not even being released there.

Our startup ecosystem is producing far more unicorns than all of europe.  They might have less inequality but they are dividing up a smaller and ever dwindling pie amonst their citizens.</div>
