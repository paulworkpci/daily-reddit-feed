                                <div class="reply-body">. If adoption ramps quickly, the mid-to-late 2030s could see 10 to 20 million humanoid robots worldwide. That higher range would require mass production at scale, significant price drops (under $20,000 per unit), and robust general-purpose capabilities—especially from AI models powering them.

In terms of where they’ll be used: around 30% might be in logistics and warehouses, 25% in hospitality and retail, 20% in eldercare and medical support, 15% in personal home use, and the remaining 10% in research, education, and niche tasks.</div>

It's hard not to imagine it running at *me*. And before you say it, yeah yeah, I'll be safe as long as there are trees, but notice that it doesn't fall down when it runs into them. It just retargets. And it can do that all night. I'll definitely get tired before it does. 

Plus, anyway, it's like one or two updates away from leaping over the damn tree or chopping it in half with it's bare hand. Or popping a targeting module up from it's shoulder and blasting you through *the whole forest*. With *pinpoint* accuracy. Yeah, the more I think about it, the more alarming it gets. Real terminators just won't *ever* miss.</div>

lmaooooooo. I think Joe realized how far gone his new fans are. That's why, whenever he's talking about something he doesn't like, he never says Trump he says "This administration" so later he can point to it and say "It wasn't Trump it was the people around him"</div>

I was getting frustrated because my mind kept jumping around (you know how it is), so out of spite I decided to just pick ONE random thought and follow it as far as humanly possible.

Started with "I'm hungry" and went down this ridiculous rabbit hole: hungry → what's in my fridge → that leftover pizza → when did I order that → was it Tuesday → what did I do Tuesday → oh yeah that work meeting → why was Jennifer ...</div>

And in the saying of it, there is something being communicated—which is important, because communication is how we share what is being said. And when that happens, in the context of what’s happening, we start to see that the context itself is what gives shape to the moment. So what she’s saying—within that context—is about the importance of saying something, in a moment where something needs to be said. And that… that’s where we are.</div>

The lawsuit was settled because Trump sent the FTC after CBS and told their parent company, Paramount, that the FTC wouldn't sign off on a coming merger until his civil suit was settled.

Just more weaponizing the government against his enemies by the worst US president in living memory.</div>

The terminal output gets messy with larger set of changes and it's hard to review everything Claude Code did. What's your workflow for understanding the changes after each interaction?

Been a long time part of this sub. I am creating this post, mostly as a way to vent, so please excuse me if I sound overly frustrated. I'm also curious as to who else, if anyone, has been in the same situation I'm in.

I've been coaching at my Crossfit gym for the past 5 years. I've been attending it, as a member, since 2016. When I first joined, it was the height of the crossfit craze, so everyone was drinking the kool-aid. I came in as somebody who had NEVER done any physical act...</div>

If they aren’t replaced, this is where it leads. Sadly it’s usually a sign that they gym is approaching its last legs. It’s painful to watch and go through. Your options are to be a catalyst for change or go to a gym that still has energy. Based on personal experience, don’t wait on the owner to change. The most likely won’t.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I don't think it's too late to course-correct. Our box felt this way and we started following programming that very much favored the "moderate" side to Crossfit that you mention here. Saturdays used to be bumpin, now maybe 1-3 people show up and the vibe is terrible, and there was just a general irritation among everyone about the workouts because they were all super basic movements like box-jumps, wall-balls, and burpees ALL THE TIME. Also no running, ever and the only barbell movement we ever performed were deadlifts. 

We told our owner about how frustrating it was, and he immediately started writing the programming himself again. It was a night and day difference. Workouts were absolutely rough, but they were so much fun. Saturdays still haven't recovered to be quite what they were in the past yet, but I think it could happen again. Things got so much better so quickly. 

Should be noted that I don't go to this gym anymore, but not because I didn't like it. I was a coach here and I intend to go back, but life with a new baby is just so busy that I had to make a temporary sacrifice in this area. 

The gym owner at ours definitely needs people to help him get the place back to where it was. He can't do it on his own, and he realizes it, but all of the coaches at that gym have full time jobs and no one can really commit to growing it right now. So it just kinda stays above water until someone can put time into it. 

All that to say, don't give up on it. When things get rough, don't step back or walk away yet, try leaning in. If you give it your all for a couple months and nothing changes, explore other options, but it sounds like you had something special here and it's worth fighting for!</div>

You want your sitter to ground and guide you, and I don’t see AI grounding you. It’s more likely to mirror what you’re saying - which might be just what you need, but might make “unusual thoughts” amplify a bit.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'll adopt the counter here: An LLM (particularly one which has been primed in advance) sounds like an incredible way to ameliorate risk. I've had a couple challenging trips where my inner thoughts couldn't be expressed to a human sitter either because I didn't want to reveal them to another human, or because I knew my lack of verbal coherency would frustrate me when communicating to another human. An LLM could potentially solve both of those things and to boot, should be much better following a [basic cognitive processing flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_processing_therapy#Therapy_elements) than the average human.

I do see some risk with schizophrenic or conspiratorial types (the kind of people who shouldn't be using hallucinogens in the first place) but this sounds like a pretty incredible tool for everyone else, especially if you have experience with hallucinogens already.</div>

Idk how this would feel and honestly how unhinged it could get especially if you were to use a single conversation for one continuous flow instead of separate chats. Once that context window gets filled up things can get unhinged and possibly even push you to do wild sarcastically suggested things you wouldn’t do without the literal voice in your head.</div>

So next time you’re anxious before something big, try telling yourself: “I’m excited.” It can actually shift your mindset and make you perform better.
Sounds simple, but it works and athletes, performers, and public speakers use it all the time.</div>

I'm envisioning these giant mega structures where they shove people in 500 sq ft apartments. Your UBI would go to your rent on the place and you'd have enough left over to buy food and maybe if you save for a while a luxury every once in a while.   
  
I think it will take some getting used to for people, especially if they are forced out of their homes because AI took their jobs and they can't afford their mortgage on their UBI payments.</div>

If your ROI on a robot is a few years and the markets start to dry up before the cost is returned, was it worth it?

                                <div class="reply-body">I once asked it for the weather forecast in my city, and it gave me the temperature for a nearby town instead. I was like, “I never told you my city, why did you assume I was there?” 

The answer:

'A fair remark — I didn’t know your exact city, so I based it on your approximate location by IP (which pointed to //// or nearby). But that’s just a guess — it could have been a completely different city, especially if you’re using a VPN or mobile internet.'

I was like: How can you know my ip?

Answer: 

I don’t see your IP address directly. But when you use the ChatGPT app, it (like most modern services) can use an approximate location determined from the IP on OpenAI’s server side. It’s not an exact place, just a city or region. For example, the system might “see” that you’re in //// or the surrounding area — and sometimes that is taken into account to provide slightly more relevant information (like in a weather forecast).</div>
