One of the biggest challenges of psychiatric holds (outside of the traumatic removal) is that many people can’t call their loved ones because they’re not allowed access to their smartphone.

I realized a few years ago that I went from having everyone's full names, addresses, phone numbers, and birthdays memorized in the 1990s to not even knowing my own phone number now that my phone does all of the work.

So I memorized my emergency contact list and I run through it once or twice a week for practice and focus.</div>

I used to cook easy stuff for a long time, then I got an air fryer and it gave me all kinds of marinades and recipes to try, and even how to prepare everything and cooking times.  Rather than grabbing fast food, I'm now cooking almost every meal and meal prepping on the weekends, and eating a lot healthier too and cooking stuff I probably never would have before. 

Plus, it really makes it easy and fun to try new stuff, and making a shopping list of seasonings and supplies.  Not to sound corny, but it's changing my life in a good way.</div>

Second, I’ve used it for medical stuff too. My son has a heart condition that will eventually require surgery one day. I uploaded his echo results and got an analysis, and surgical options (some of which I wasn’t even aware of) and it helped me go through his symptoms, areas for concern, etc. 

Even though I’m a nurse, sometimes it makes it harder with family. Hard to be subjective. I’ll either downplay things or catastrophize. It’s hard to find the sweet spot. It was immensely helpful, more so than anything I’ve had at his cardiology appointments, and he’s got great doctors.</div>

Along with transcripts of audio recordings of us talking to doctors and nurses, so it can translate for us to remember the info better later.

Also Genetic Programming, ie, evolving populations of computer programs, has been around since the at least the 80s. It’s really interesting to see how LLMs can be used with GP, but this is not some new self-recursive breakthrough or AGI.</div>

**The Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) is a self-improving AI system that iteratively modifies its Python codebase, empirically validating—instead of formally proving—its coding agent capabilities on SWE-bench/Polyglot using frozen foundation models. Its Darwinian open-ended exploration maintains an agent archive, selecting parent agents via performance and fewer existing children (for novelty) for self-modification; these parents analyze their own benchmark logs to propose codebase changes, improving internal tools (e.g., granular file viewing/editing, string replacement) and workflows (e.g., multi-attempt solutions, history-aware patch generation). DGM demonstrably improved performance from 20.0% to 50.0% (SWE-bench) and 14.2% to 30.7% (Polyglot), surpassing non-self-improving/non-open-ended baselines, with discovered features generalizing across FMs/languages under sandboxed, human-overseen conditions. By empirically validating its own evolving code modifications drawn from an inter-generational archive, DGM demonstrates a practical path toward open-ended, recursively self-advancing AI systems.**</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Absolutely! Essentially, our hearts have a frequency (pacing of beats) that gets out of whack when we are anxious or stressed. Through compassion meditation (e.g. heart-brain coherence), we are able to tune the heart frequency back in line with the mind and body. The heart sends signals to the brain so that they sync in harmony. This is the normal state it should be in. 

You can learn more by looking up Joe Dispenza or using the free Healthy Minds app. Both of these resources talk more about how compassion and the heart regulate how we feel. It’s cool stuff!</div>

I am preparing a text file with all the comments I need to copy/paste:

1. That was fake.

2. Yes, AI can fake videos that well now.

3. No it wasn't really on Fox News.  That news report was fake too.

4. Yes, AI can fake Fox News reports.

5. Ok, Boomer. I have bad news for you.  Fox News was fake BEFORE AI started doing it too.</div>

Saw an obviously AI generated video today of a grotesquely muscular guy who looked liked like a live action street fighter character punching a tree trunk and destroying it with his fists. Half the people were saying it was fake "because the wood looked like it was already cut and hollowed out".

Slower on the first rotation, spin faster on the second. 

Helps you feel it “spin” around your body. 

When I like to challenge myself on timing, I try and close my eyes and do it for like 20-30 DU reps. Helps timing with that too.</div>

EDIT: That’s not a reason to not do them “cornered,” since the physical benefits are the same regardless. It’s also my fav way to do them… but I don’t do them that way because I don’t want to rep a different version than the one I’ll need in competition. But for athletes who don’t care about competing or their Open scores, cornered is the way to go.</div>

This is more slop from the sketchy folks who brought you "the model refused to terminate its processes (when you write a prompt merely asking it do so, one that is simultaneously in tension with other prompts)!". I remember HTB from when I was an undergraduate: it offers pen testing environments that are primarily used by novices, learners and non-field enthusiasts.

Notably, the first event was organized (in conjunction with HTB) by Palisade themselves, with no details in the report about the design methodology. The tasks seemed to be created explicitly for what Palisade agents were proficient in - there were no challenges involving penetration of remote machines, which is HTB's normal bread and butter, presumably since Palisade's agents are incapable of that. When Palisade agents participated in a regular HTB event that they didn't create themselves (Cyber Apocalypse 2025) the models performed very poorly: scoring 5/62, 3/62 and 2/62.

One non-Palisade AI agent did score well in the latter competition, but again, touting "better than 90% of human teams" doesn't mean very much given that the competition was open, designed with educational purposes in mind, and the vast majority of participants were likely early undergraduates (or high school students) whose participation was casual. (Notably, 49% of teams solved 0 challenges.)

This pseudo-research seems to exist entirely to generate revenue by driving views to X.</div>

Taking a look at these benchmarks, Gemini comes out on top in basically everything.

But am I missing something about Opus' intended use case that means these benchmarks aren't as relevant? Because to me, it seems like I would see no benefit in using Opus 4. Nobody is making me, but I'm just curious to understand.</div>

Even Chris Harris had some notoriety as a journalist before breaking out to YT, then into Top Gear. 

Proud of the lads from starting their work from Toronto/GTA, and basically pulling off the dream.

I wonder if the long trip videos they did recently had somewhat of an intention to catch the eyes of Amazon/BBC for Top Gear/TGT successors</div>

Every single enthusiast has been calling their videos the second incarnation of grand tour/top gear for a long time now. They have a great chemistry together and have a wonderful way of presenting the cars while incorporating fun and personality into the videos. Hope they go on to do great things in the show!

I hope Amazon gives them the freedom to do their own thing instead of trying to replicate what GT/TG were. They have their own great style of presentation and plenty of experience to boot. I'm sure they'll do great with it on the show.</div>

Whenever I did what OP suggested, they hit back with "focus on this first, you can do the other stuff later", then later when i finish the new piece, they demand to know why the rest is not finished yet and act pike I've been working on them for far too long.

                                <div class="reply-body">That's the issue with declining, that doesn't set boundaries, it just comes off as you turning away work. Given lay offs left and right, you don't want to give off that image. This on the other hand is you still declining without declining. You are still setting the boundaries because you've established what you can get done and when. 

With this, they can keep giving you more work but they will just get it later and later. If they need it done earlier they will be forced to find someone else because it's not that you're just unwilling... you've shown you're willing, it's just that you're already busy.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The thing I always say about this level of optimism is as follows.

We've understood the mechanisms of how to do this for a long time, there are academic papers, there are centuries of thought gone into this very idea. 

It's not the lack of ideas, or a framework of how to achieve abundance and freedom that's missing. It's the willingness of those in charge, and holding capital that is missing.

No amount of ai will fix that problem. We have the intelligence, we lack the power to effect change. And again, handing super intelligence to those with power, is not gonna speed up them letting go of that power. It's gonna concentrate it further, supercharging their wealth at the expense of the common folk. Every single major technological advancement has done this, and AI will be no different. Come back to this comment is 50 years and tell me I'm wrong. Please.</div>

Everything comes down to one question: when does the average person hit their pain threshold and finally decide to act? Being ready to organize, to fight, to push for change. But the real failure isn’t the system, it’s the millions who won’t lift a finger against it. A system only stands because lazy people let it. ASI and AGI aren't going to change that. The only thing that will change it is the societal collective agreement to force change.</div>

Most people don’t know that Kurt was in the process of wanting to get a divorce from Courtney. But Kurt died before that could happened. 

So Courtney inherited all of Kurt’s money and royalties. And her album came out a month later and was pretty successful. If Kurt didn’t die then she wouldn’t get anything and her album would be a flop.</div>

Law enforcement, powerful media influencers, this kind of thing. There's no way Courtney and a few other junkies not only masterminded the thing, but also got away scot-free and had the whole investigation sewn up neat and the media narrative cemented overnight. That does not add up to me. I think the true story goes higher up than we'll probably ever fully know.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">In simple English, they basically took inspiration from actual neurons and allowed the signals going into the models' neurons to influence each other before they enter into the neuron. In some sense, if the model has a semantic concept signal coming into a neuron, and other neurons say things like the first signal is close to the ground truth, then the neuron actually experiences a larger signal.

Broken down more, if I have a box, and I put fruit into the box, this is kind of like me watching what you put into the box and switching the fruit to a different one, sometimes same or different depending on what you put in and what other people put in. Since the inputs can affect each other, you end up getting a richer representation within the neuron itself. 

Some notes of hesitancy, while the method they detail in itself appears to be able to scale (quickly work with our current infrastructure), they did not test it on a very large model. So, in theory it should work well, but it has not yet been tested on anything large.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If you're going to claim an arch is the successor to the transformer, you better be damn sure your paper evaluates the model against large language datasets.

This paper contains some toy RL examples, CIFAR-10, and, the closest thing to a language dataset, Meta's bAbI. There are no results on natural language or advanced reasoning tasks.

I'm not saying it wouldn't be capable for doing those tasks, but the authors have yet to prove that. Which makes me suspect when they claim it's the successor to the transformer...</div>

Most practical option is just release what you have and hope someone with access to an ai super computer cluster will do all the testing for you.

For me, the premise of their idea makes sense.  I have seen research that is takes approximately a 1000 artificial neurons to emulate 1 biological neurons output.  
I think ai algorithms are still early days.  Kind of like ray tracing in computer generated movies used to take months of super computer time to render a scene.  Now, modern algorithms and hardware can do it all in real time.</div>

A lot of the time it’s not our job to figure out what it is, rather, what it isn’t - heart attack, stroke, etc. A final ER diagnosis is not necessary most of the time. Rather, ruling out life threatening issues first then deciding on final disposition - admit or discharge home to follow up with family physician. However, if this improves or expedites workups and the diagnostic portion of the visit I think this will be a big boon for Emergency Medicine and Family Practice in general.</div>

When we look at the AI coding landscape, there are actually two fundamentally different approaches:

**Approach 1: Subscription-based infrastructure** Tools like Cursor and Windsurf operate on a subscription model ($15-20/month) where they handle the AI infrastructure for you....</div>

As someone with a little tool fatigue who is defaulting to Claude Code at the moment, I'd love your take on how/when developers should pop their head up and review the progress all these tools have made and pick the best one. It's almost like the tooling needs a benchmark (same model, same prompt, different agent-based solutions). Apologies if this already exists and I don't know about it.</div>

love this idea

Honestly, I think the approach is to find an IDE you like (be it Cursor/Windsurf/VS Code) and then as long as you're using one of the tools defined in Approach 2 (or any others that fit which I failed to mention), you're going to be getting SOTA results as long as you're using SOTA models. 

The models are the real secret sauce in Approach 2, not the tools. The tools are really just teeing up the models to hit a home run, and they get better as the models do. 

Maybe keep in touch with what's going on, but don't feel like you're really missing out.

The only caveat I would point out with Claude Code is the case when Anthropic isn't putting out the best models. I think you're in good shape with it right now, but bear in mind you are locked into Anthropic models.</div>

Hell, in one of the last two episodes went and started trash-talking him down to how weak he looks. Never gave him the opportunity (from what I’m aware of) to correct, clarify, or defend anything that Joe thinks he lied or misled the audience on. 

The best I can figure is that Joe sees Graham is such a friend and interesting person, that he feels personally attacked. He’s had on Graham more than once, other charlatans who ride those co...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It’s so much worse than that. Flint was diagnosed with cancer and had to delay the Hancock episode for that reason, and Jimmy Corsetti publicly accused Flint of  lying about it to dodge the debate. Dan the “Dedunker” also had an army of trolls harassing Flint and attempting to get him fired. These are the grifting losers Rogan decided to have on the pod after Flints appearance to smear him in his absence. 

Flint is incessantly berated on all social media by the hordes of witless monkeys who just feel they are honoring their lord and savior.

And for what? Because Flint got the number of discovered shipwrecks wrong? 

Never forget that one clip of Rogan viciously attacking and mocking a primatologist for challenging his Bigfoot opinions. That’s who he always has been deep down.</div>

It’s the dumb jock in school who says the math test was stupid and made no sense and then gets angry at you when you get a good grade and try to explain how to actually do the work. They want to be patted on the back for their fun lazy way of thinking about things and fair enough because conspiracy talk is fun. BUT when they try to claim they want the truth and then roll their eyes when someone gives it to them and it’s not “fun” anymore…well, just admit you didn’t want the boring truth from the start.

                        <div class="comment-body">I don't get his reaction. I understand that Graham Hancock is Joe's friend. But the way he talks about Flint is entirely exaggerated to how Flint acted on the podcast. From what I remember, Flint wasn't confrontational. He merely questioned Graham's "research" and challenged him to provide more proof. I never got the sense from Flint that he thought Graham's findings were 100% impossible. It's just not what the majority of archeological evidence points to. I also want really cool discoveries to be made, aliens to be real, etc. But I dont deny that this stuff has to be proven. Joe sounds incredibly foolish to me when he puts Flint down the way he does.</div>

But Flint didn’t do anything wrong other than say something was rooted in racism whether Graham knew it or not.  That sent Joe through the roof and we are never gonna hear the end of it.

Whatever errors Flint made pale in comparison to the leaps Graham takes in his position.</div>
