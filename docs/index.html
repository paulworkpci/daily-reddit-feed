To me this deal was never going to happen, and Zelenskyy knew it from the moment Trump said "we'll sign it now, security comes later". He said it multiple times too. 

Another important moment was when a reported asked Trump "what about the minerals in occupied territories, what happens if Russia attacks again".

Zelenskyy did the right thing, calling out Trump for not getting security and guarantees included up front. 

Having Russian media in the WH, and now WH  says they don’t know how they got in, proves that Trump is acting on Russia’s behalf. Not a straight up meeting, Z was set up for failure. So smart that he called it out now, before signing a horrible deal.</div>

**Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite (Vertex AI):**

* **Input:** $0.075
* **Input audio:** $0.075
* **Output text:** $0.30

**Gemini 2.0 Flash (Vertex AI):**

* **Input:** $0.15
* **Input audio:** $1.00
* **Output text:** $0.60

**Gemini 1.5 Flash:**

* Input price was reduced to $0.075.
* Output price is $0.30 for prompts under 128K.</div>

If coding or doing logical tasks, DS v3 is better than Flash by a lot though. R1 is obviously miles ahead of v3/2.0 flash</div>

It’s like selling lemonade on the side of the road and only figuring in the cost of the lemonade that goes in the cup. You have to factor the cost of the table, the jar, the mix, the time you spent making the lemonade and the sign, and the time value of sitting on the side of the road selling 50 cent cups of lemonade. 

Deepseek is the little kid selling the lemonade claiming unbelievable profit, not the parents who had to pay to make it happen.</div>

In fairness DeepSeek is still lacking important things like vision and it didn’t make the transition to siloed but decent agents like Deep Research. It’s still behind a bit, but my God it’s so cheap and the base reasoner is so good that if they grind away for another year they will surpass the American labs just like the Chinese did in American pioneered areas like drones, batteries, EVs and humanoid robotics. It’s not a guarantee but imo it’s quite likely</div>

On that note, my electric bike had an artificial speed limit put on it that cut off the motor because of U.S. laws even though it had enough juice in it to go 5-10 MPH faster.

As AI gets better, instead of coding snake, we'll be able to code our own drone and bike OS that lets us do what we want with our devices.</div>

I was walking my dog through the park this morning and it was pretty windy. I didn't realize just how windy until we were pretty deep in the park and I noticed how much the trees were swaying. Every path had some degree of tall trees, so there really wasn't a tree-free passage out, so I'm just wondering if there is something to look for to ensure that, if nothing else...</div>

Bark falling off, broken branches, and sick-looking trees (the ones that have less of a branching lung look / less smaller twigs at the ends of their branches) are telltale signs of a dangerous tree. That being said, some otherwise healthy looking trees can be completely hollow inside and fall without warning.</div>

- Ukraine has bern led down this path by former US administrations,as a means of bleeding the russian army through a proxy,  but now the US is washing their hands of Ukraine. thus the US is not trustworthy as an ally
- this calls into question NATO article 5, european countries now no longer trust the US to  honor article 5. which is ironic as the US is the only country to invoke article 5, and many European countries got entangled in Iraq and Afghanistan to honor it. now that was all for nothing.
- a lot of euro countries have bought american military equipment partly to grease the wheeels of article 5. some of this equipment reportedly has kill-switches, like the F-35. if the us cannot to be trusted, then Europe will just buy european gear going forward, because no reason to grease the wheels and being invaded by Putin and then Trump grounding your air fleet is terrifying backstab, but we have seen that Trump is willing to backstab allies. Trump is also adding tolls, so even less reason to buy US stuff.


what will likely happen now is european countries wash their hands of the US. we stop buying your stuff, buy from our Euro brothers instead. next time you need us to fight your wars, don’t bother calling. Euro consumers will boycott US stuff, including software and cloud services.  Euro countries will make one or more Euro-centered alternative coalitions to NATO without the US. France,Germany and Great Britain will work closer on defense, and build their armies. 

Nordics will become one giant fortress, as Norway, Sweden and Denmark push to match Finland in preparedness, and swedes and norwegians move to fortify along northern flank, lining up forces close to the Russian border to defend every inch of territory. Euro countries will move to create closer ties with Great Britain on defense,as it takes the US place in Europe. </div>

My day is 6am to noon and I'm not crazy

You're crazy for thinking it takes 24 hours just like some dude in a cave did 300 years ago

Stack that up over a month, I'm gonna kick your butt

Stack it over a year, you're toast

Stack it up over 5 years my entire life is different than It would've been otherwise.</div>

Yes sir, here you go, sir! Take special note of page 27 where the aliens heard you were co-president with Donald Trump and they said, “Again?! The guy with the debilitating STDs is president again?! And the psycho ketamine emerald mine super-villain wannabe is _co-president_?!” And then they said they’re never coming back. And here you both are with Epstein…</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Lifelong republican voter. I will preface by saying I have never been specifically a Trump fan to begin with, but for me a key line that has been crossed is destroying our relationship with our allies. The other significant line is actually entertaining the idea that the executive branch does not have to follow orders from the courts. The people voted for a President, not a king. I'm of the mind that the republican party needs to immediately intensely pressure Trump to reverse course on the absurd path he's going down and if they can not succeed with that in any meaningful way very soon then it is their duty to impeach and remove him. I will certainly never vote republican again in my lifetime if that doesn't happen and I would consider the entire party treasonous.</div>

Some Redditors even created a tracker where you can see how much of this abhorrent doctrine they’ve already implemented

The Republican majority Supreme Court and Congress both have had every opportunity to challenge Trump’s insane doings, but instead they’re ceding power to the Executive branch without a fight and actively supporting his plans to turn our country into a fascist dictatorship. There will be no impeachment or removal while the Republican Party is still in power because the party is completely compromised.</div>

                <div class="post-content">A girl in her 20s said I was crazy and weird when I didn't have social media saying how can I live without social media.

I tell her we were the generation born before social media. We can survive without it.

She also says that having no social media is a red flag in a guy because it implies he is hiding something... 🤷‍♂️

Like why tf do I need to show my life to the world.

Side note i was actually addicted to social media at one point. Too much clutter and I was getting addicted to tiktok vid...</div>

The one on the left is not earlier than 2009, and the one on the right is no later than 2024. So, 15 years at most, probably significantly less. 

Botox is playing a role, and his hair plugs have finally failed. 

Lastly, the Parkinson’s disease also affects the way he is able to move his facial muscles. 

So, there’s a lot going on there, but I have zero doubt that those images are of the same person.</div>

You have just ascended to a Goebbels-like figure. The richest man in the world, Musk, is begging to be on your propaganda show to rehab his image because polls show he’s reviled and you’re beloved in fascist circles.

At the height of your power, are you going to invite some brutally honest liberal-minded jester like Burr to come in and produce another mega viral
Video making you look like a fucking stooge?

Wife and I were at the Kite beach, Jumeirah when she spotted this light. It appeared to be moving at the cloud level or slightly below. I’m no drone expert but it appeared to be too high for a drone, didn’t move like a drone and the lights were also not consistent with a drone. Regarding the elevation of clouds, i don’t have exact data but I know that planes flying out of DXB towards the sea and taking a left side U-turn were crossing over this spot at the clouds level.

You caught one! Looks legit, we see them, but nobody can tell you what those are. People call them Orbs, but no one really knows, all we DO know is that these things truly exist. I would send that to MUFON.

1. have to have paid attention to previous Presidents to know what other Presidents have done or comported themselves 
2. actually care or value that type of Presidential temperament 
3. don't see all of the world as entertainment and actually understand that actions have implications
4. value America instead of blindly following the person who is President

And those things do not exist with the majority of Trump supporters.</div>
