                <div class="post-content">Crazy UAP out over the Ocean just offshore of Atlantic City.  I was setting up for some astrophotography and saw something moving out of the corner of my eye.. i slewed my lens over to it and took a 15 second exposure.  
What i saw with my eye was a bright object that was stationary with a smaller orb randomly circling it.

You can see from the stars in the background that this was not a camera movement effect.  the light trail of the smaller orb is due to the shutter being open for 30 seconds.

                        <div class="comment-body">Astronomer here. This is the star Capella, quite a beautiful star and the sixth brightest in the sky. It is the star and not a UFO because when we solve for the coordinates of the image, Capella is there in the middle surrounded by the field stars that we expect to find around it.

Capella is much brighter than the surrounding stars, by over six magnitudes in this field of view. That means it's over 100x brighter. You can produce this image by exposing Capella for a number of seconds, and then bumping your camera in the middle of it. Because Capella is 100x brighter, it will leave a trail as your camera vibrates, and the other stars will not leave a detectable trail.

Proof:

1 - Field solution:

2 - The star as seen in stellarium-web. Compare the surrounding stars if you don't trust the field solution.

I feel the x.com OP is a dishonest person for lying about this image with his story. I would not trust any of his claims. However, we must thank him for posting a real image that is easily identified.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Amazing analysis!

But like you said, I’m glad that we got a very clear image that has the lens info, it helps to prove/disprove. I believe that this is the same individual who *reached out* to Barber on X saying he can use his camera setup to capture evidence.

At first I thought the guy was being genuine when he reached out to Barber, but after this stunt, that whole interaction between the two is starting to seem fishy to me. 

This individual had to have known that it was Capella in this image, considering the high end equipment that they have and their level of experience. It seems to me like he knew the image would fool most people, especially with the explanation for the long exposure along with the lens information, making it seem more legit and his story genuine. The timing for this image also seems too convenient. I have a feeling that he’s going to be partnered up with the grifter crew very shortly.</div>

I know people like him, but we’ve got over 300 million people in America. There’s at least one who wants to fix things that are obviously wrong *and* has a factually-sound understanding of health and science. 

There’s this, him citing studies where fluoride is several times higher than US levels as an argument against US levels, and so many examples of him needing to misrepresent reality to make his case against things. Bring the actual facts and let’s see how people feel about those. Maybe the same, but the discussions need to be had with the right information. 

I know we’re desensitized to top officials lacking fundamental understanding of their “areas of expertise” after folks like Perry and DeVos, but this is seriously not good.</div>

Once im done with a clay project or gaming like I don’t have people to talk about it with. But if I do try disciplining long enough I can actually fix my dopamine possibly.  I’m just really lonely atp it’s just really getting to me and being 18 not having a self identity like anyone else I’m just a mess.

                        <div class="comment-body">You need to start small. Even if it's moving your phone to the other side of the room or place you stay in. Create obstacles in-between you and easy dopamine hits. Buy an alarm clock and sweat it out if you need your phone to wake you up. 

You sound like you are depressed and lack the drive to exist. I've been there and it does feel like there's no way out but there always is because you had to use an entrance to get to where you are now. 

Start thinking of who you are even a little bit close to, reach out to them even if it means you get rejected. There is nothing more exhilarating than sending a message that is very significant. Most people want to help and if the people you reach out to don't want to help or find your current situation embarrassing, they aren't worth your time. 

The interests you still have, use reddit to interact with people that share the same interests, seeing people like yourself make stuff always inspires me. Use the resources on your phone to help too.

Delete the apps you doomscroll on most, it's an addiction, alternatively you can use a passcode to restrict screen time, get a friend or family member to make the passcode and never tell you it. 

There isn't one thing you need to do, there are many but a lot of them are small. If you really want to get out of it you will, just keep at it and record your progress and make sure to look back on it every now and then for a moral boost.</div>

# Overall Assessment:

The plan’s ambition to tackle tech addiction and rebuild communal values is commendable, but many proposals are **overly authoritarian** and lack nuance. Measures like mandatory service, censorship of influencers, and outright bans risk violating personal freedoms and fostering backlash. While regulating addictive design and funding public goods through taxes are pragmatic steps, success would require global cooperation, careful implementation, and balancing innovation with ethics. Addressing root causes (e.g., mental health support, education reform) may be more effective than punitive measures.

**Verdict**: A provocative starting point for debate, but impractical and ethically fraught in its current form. Incremental, evidence-based policies would likely yield better outcomes.</div>

Edit : I am testing a 1500 line javascript code which o1 pro failed to debug despite 50+ attempts. Will report back.

Drones Are Still Over New Jersey  
  
Mayor Melham says drones were over his home last night, despite the White House’s assertion that the activity has concluded.  
  
“Drones are still flying here, so when they use the past tense, that’s alarming.”

As you can see the NHI give no fucks, still flying over politicians houses despite the White house stating they're gone. They are making a statement and it's only going to continue from here. Hopefully in a positive way and not in a alien invasion kind of way.</div>

When you think about the sheer amount of money the Dept of Energy has, along with Big Oil entities, big aerospace corporations, and the entire MIC--we're talking about the richest, most powerful forces in the whole world being against disclosure. Because it would kill their bottom line, unless they were in control of it. 

It would be similar to the recent Deepseek release crashing AI market value...but the AI market is very young, while the military and oil entities have had a chokehold on the U.S. economy for a whole lifetime, numerous decades.</div>

I decided to stick with subs that are about my true hobbies and passions. r/synthesizers, r/meditation, r/sewing, and a few others.

To be honest, it completely changes my relation to reddit. It is still some kind of distraction, but I cut my usage in half, if not more. I Only spend up to 5 minutes on it before leaving.</div>

Are you claiming that Putin invaded Ukraine to help Blackrock and JP Morgan? That seems unlikely.

I'm also confused by your reference to "Central Bank". A reconstruction bank is not a monetary authority like a central bank. Ukraine has had its own central bank since it split from the Soviet Union in 1991. Before that there was the State Bank of the USSR and before that the State Bank of the Russian Empire, dating back to 1860.</div>

They aren't trying to help them; they're trying to own them. The more money they give them, the deeper in debt they become. Once the interest becomes so crushing, they are forced to sell off natural resources, which Ukraine is rich in.</div>

For bigger tasks, **commit to just two minutes**—start writing, read one page, do one push-up. Momentum is key. You’ll often keep going once you start.

Action beats overthinking. The hardest part is beginning. Set a timer, start small, and watch productivity snowball. 🚀

                        <div class="comment-body">Lets extend "The hardest part is beginning." idea to habit setting.

When you set goals don't express them as 'complete such-n-such by this date'. 

Instead focus on the TRANSITIONS because \*that's\* the hard part.

Consider these goals:

"Work out X hours per week."  
vs.  
"Put myself inside the gym doors at least 5x per week, never missing more than two days in a row."  


I am far better with the second one because 'doing an hour of exercise' is indeed far harder than 'putting myself inside the gym because once I'm there I know I'll start working out and likely finish it too ... and if one out of ten times I get frustrated and leave that's ok too."</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">When I was in my early 20s I worked as an energy worker in field service. One of my really close friends was someone who I was on calls with regularly.  A project lead pressured both of us to work on equipment we weren’t qualified or trained to work on and we unfortunately relented. 

We were halfway done with the task and I walked out to the truck to grab water bottles. Half way to the truck I hear a giant buzz, then a huge bang, then screaming. By the time I get back to the generator room, he’s fully on fire. The cabinet had arc blasted and he had been right in the way. By the time I got our fire blanket from the truck he was basically fully engulfed. I was able to put him out and get him into as much of a recovery position as I could and then I called our shop to get them to organize rescue to our location. 

He somehow survived 80-90% second and third degree burns but coded so many times he ended up with severe brain damage from oxygen depravation. He lost his eyes, his sense of smell and taste and much of his sense of touch. I think he lost his hearing too from the noise of it too. He’s in a vegetative state in a full time care facility now. I had frequent nightmares for years about it. The thing that stuck with me the most was since the arc blast had hit him basically right in the face, it basically boiled his skin off. I ran in and saw him ripping large pieces of his face off while he tried to bat the flames off. The smell and sight of that never goes away</div>

This is also coming from someone that used to love Opie and Anthony. I thought Anthony was the funniest guy around and redbar was a hater. I was so wrong. Give it a year!</div>

Funny how they laugh at others pain but when they do the same thing they cry and threaten violence lol. Selena Gomez is a fucken tool tho, I just hate hypocrites like most of Rogaine’s crew.

Edited: accidentally put Rohan instead of Rogan and I can’t risk the confusion since they’re polar opposites.</div>
