I found it hilarious when I found out about his wife (a woman who he would normally call a cock-carousel leftover chick) and their wild patchwork family. This guy makes a living out of talking down to and insulting women, being cruel and proposing some weird trad-family, Christian nonsense - yet he is the 3rd father of his wife's children and they apparently cheated and made one of their own 2 children out of wedlock.

Not being able to open a jar as a wannabe manly-man (which is also hilarious, this fucker hasn't worked out his whole life and probably can't even throw a punch) is just the cherry on top.</div>

&gt; We can no longer sell cars just with model updates, slightly better fuel efficiency, or new designs. It comes down to your passion for making products that move people’s hearts.”

My brother in christ you are ceo of *the* reliable econobox company just put the corolla cross hybrid in the bag.

Like he has a point, and money where his mouth is with cars like the prius prime and recent rav4 gr-sport, but their core product remains making incremental improvements to the best appliances on the market. Nobody buys a camry because it moved their heart, and this gen is more of a refresh than anything.

Has anyone ever looked at a venza or crown signia and been inspired</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I know people rip on the Corolla and Camry, but I have driven quite a few of them, and they are definitely above average, but more interesting is if you drive an older model, EVERYONE will come up to you and tell you stories about owning one and how much they loved it and how much it meant to them. Grandma's, nerds, pizza guys, trades guys, Philipino father's, everyone.


Enthusiasts think the only connection you can have with a car is when it's fun and exciting, when other enthusiasts admire it, but non car people also love cars, and for different reasons, memories of almost being stranded or getting through storms in their unstoppable econobox. Camrys and Corollas are great cars and some people can own them for a significant portion of their lives. There are other emotional connections than being inspired.</div>

If anything, he’s trying to get back into the mindset of what Toyota was in the mid 80s to mid 90s after having 20 years of tremendous success that affords them the ability to do so. That’s the right move and I can’t believe takes like this are getting upvoted.</div>

There’s a common belief that meditation only happens when we’re cross-legged, eyes closed, silent and still.
But the truth is, meditation is any moment you become fully here.
It can happen:
	- In the middle of a workout, when your breath and movement align and your mind quiets.
       - On a walk outdoors, when you feel the wind against your skin and notice the rhythm of your footsteps.
	- While eating, when e...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm a little unclear of what you are saying. How much of our body do we have to be aware of right now in order to qualify as "being here, right now?" 

Does this attention to the details of the now moment include the details of one's surroundings, as well? How much of THAT attention needs to be sharp in order to qualify "being here, right now?" 

In this sense, can one person be more meditating than another, depending on the percentage of their inner and outer circumstances they are aware of? Or is an on-off switch at say 40%, perhaps? More than that, one is meditating, less than that, no.

Secondly, is this attentiveness discredited if it is not accompanied with gratitude? In other words, if someone is fully aware of their body, actions and surroundings but is not appreciative of any of it (say they are in a prison somewhere), does that mean they are not meditating in the sense of "being here, right now?"

Thanks for your thoughts.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I really appreciate your thoughtful breakdown, it’s clear you’ve sat with these ideas deeply.
To me, “being here, right now” isn’t about hitting a certain percentage of body awareness, nor is it a rigid standard. It’s more of a felt quality, like a moment where your awareness isn’t scattered across timelines, but gently gathered into the now. Whether you’re fully attuned to your heartbeat, the temperature in the room, or the sound of a passing car doesn’t necessarily matter, it’s about whether you are with yourself and your experience, even if only lightly. Presence can be sharp, or it can be soft and subtle. Both are valid.
As for whether presence “counts” without gratitude. I’d say no, it’s not discredited. Presence can include pain, discomfort, numbness, even indifference. Someone in prison may be entirely present in their suffering or their stillness, and that is no less of a meditation than one soaked in joy or appreciation.Gratitude often arises from presence, but it’s not a requirement for it.
The doorway isn’t gated by emotion. It’s opened by awareness.</div>

Being present to the moment is indeed a form of meditation, and it's a very important practice, but the state of meditation where you are still, and seeing things through your inner eyes, and turning your gaze inwards is distinct from it.  One is presence, and the other is sort of "being."</div>

Yes, the "state of meditation." I prefer not to confuse /conflate that practice of engaging in the state of meditation with other ways of being "present." While they all have value and are an integral part of living a life of mindfulness - the effort, the intention, the personal dedication to the daily practice of entering the state of meditation for a period of time is distinct. While all of it might be to a greater or lesser degree "meditative," in a sense, the "state of meditation" is - in my assessment as a meditator for almost 50 years - distinct.</div>

4chan posted about him being walked out and put into a van BEFORE any legacy media broke the news.

Someone who looks exactly like him was filmed on little st james in a UTV months after — when this man noticed the drone filming him, he immediately went back under the topper of his UTV.

His girlfriend’s father owned the company that produces textbooks in 95% of American schools. Maxwell-hill -&gt; Robert Maxwell, a known mossad asset.

TBF it was likely a real challenge finding a hosting space that’s ridiculously cheap and not risk-averse (since all events are vetted &amp; insured). Admittedly the venue’s unlikely at significant risk, but nobody wants to host a negligent group, if only for the potential bad PR.

And CF was EXTREMELY negligent.

When trying to schedule a hang, rather than asking an entire group of 5+ invitees their availability, start a side convo with 1 or 2 "core" invitees to find your available date and times.

Once decided then open it up to the extended group, e.g. "X, Y, and I are gett...</div>

I want to nit pick this phrasing. By saying "X, Y, and I are getting together", you have set the stage for the person you are texting to feel excluded. Why did you plan with X and Y before contacting this friend?


Instead, I would text, "I'm planning a group dinner for next Friday and I would love it if you could come."


No need to advertise they are "second string" friends.</div>

Do not let people know who are the core friends and who are the whatever friends. Just Say "I was looking to organize a dinner on friday. Would you like to join?"</div>

Like I fully support getting together with all your friends that are able to, and when you try to include so many people it's bound to happen that one or two won't be able to make it.

This is why I like to stick to the Levels of AGI made by Google DeepMind themselves. If I’m out here saying we’ll achieve Competent AGI by the end of 2025 and people think I’m talking about the kind of thing Demis is mentioning here, then yeah it sounds delusional. But I’m clearly talking about an AI agent that can perform a wide range of non-physical tasks at the level of at least the 50th percentile of skilled adults.

There’s a huge difference between AGI and ASI, and I don’t know why both Sam Altman and Demis Hassabis keep using the word AGI when they are really talking about ASI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think I can see their perspective. If they're the first to take the risk in stepping over the AGI line then the only prize they'll win is a river of bullshit they'll need to defend their position against for months. Having a good technical justification won't mean shit to most vocal people. Much easier to just wait until whenever those people finally shut up and then only step over the line when the loudest voices are people making fun of them for waiting so long.

So AGI can't be defined technically, in public at least, here he's really defining it as the point at which he thinks the rising capability waters will finally drown the last refuges and silence the sceptic mob.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">To me it’s more marketing, the term AGI is so well known right now while ASI seems like some sci-fi bs in the ears of a normal individual that doesn’t follow this stuff.

If we were to reach the level Demis is talking about here then the world would be transformed dramatically and their hype about “AGI”(which is really ASI) would be vindicated. 

However if we reach level 3 AGI, it may still be seen as a tool to the average person. Nothing special nothing that can dramatically shape the world we live in. There will be layoffs but not enough to where people are forming Pickett lines.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I appreciate the way he’s looking at this - and I obviously agree we don’t have AGI today - but his definition seems a bit strict IMO. 

Consider the same argument, but made for the human brain: anyone can find flaws with the brain in minutes. Things that AI today can do, but the brain generally can’t. 

For example: working memory. The human is only able to about keep track of at most 4-5 items in memory at once, before getting confused. LLMs can obviously do much more. This means they do have the potential to solve problems at a more complex level. 

Or: optical illusions. The human brain is so frequently and consistently fooled by them, that one is led to think it’s a fundamental flaw in our vision architecture. 

So I don’t actually think AGI needs to be “flawless” to a large extent. It can have obvious flaws, large flaws even. But it just needs to be “good enough”.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Humanity is generally intelligent. This means, for a large number of tasks: there is some human that can do it. A single human's individual capabilities is not the right comparison here. 

Consider that a teenager is generally intelligent but cannot drive. This doesn't mean AGI need not be able to drive. Rather, a teenager is generally intelligent because you can teach them to drive.

An AGI could still make mistakes sure. But given that it is a computer, it is reasonable to expect its flaws to be difficult to find. Given its ability to rigorously test and verify. Plus, perfect recall and calculation abilities.</div>

The difference is that when it's the other way around most people would assume (until established otherwise) that if the computer isn't as good as a human at something this is because its thinking isn't robust and general enough. 

Because computers are already _today_ intelligent to a  superhuman degree in many areas but if that's so then why don't we have ASI yet? Because it's jagged intelligence and our ability to reason is just more robust than the machine's ability. So we may be worse at particular skills but our ability to generalize is just such a compounded advantage that the computer can't match human performance in some areas.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The difference here is not about testing the safety of the vaccine or its efficacy its about testing the value added for generally healthy people getting additional doses. 

This isn't particularly controversial, most countries now follow a similar approach and treat the offer of additional doses in line with flu vaccines which is a testament to how effective the initial round of vaccines were. Here in the UK most people do not get offered boosters unless you're over 75 or have underlying health conditions such as asthma.</div>

They’ve watched it develop in ways they could never have imagined, in such short periods of time. After a certain point it can’t even be kept up with. Soon it’ll be all of us, not just old people. I would have never guessed this was AI, or believed it could be done just a couple years ago. We are catapulting into this stuff with no perceived idea what things are going to end up like.
