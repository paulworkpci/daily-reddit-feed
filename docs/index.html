But hyper specialized skills will always need improved


Like I bike ride a lot. Obviously more leg = more go. But for keeping the pace for a couple hours... Crossfit doesn't prepare me for what I call "cowboy walk" and sore ass when I go back to biking regularly after winter.</div>

Am I a great Crossfitter? Nope, but being fitter, stronger and leaner made me a much better biker. I still had to put the time in on the bike as it’s very skill specific.  But I got faster as I got stronger and fitter.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">From my experience in endurance sports and triathlon, crossfit does not prepare you for those activities.  Could a crossfitter finish a marathon, maybe, probably do ok in a half marathon but they're not going to be remotely competitive.  You should see how the people at my box react when they see longer runs in the wod.  We train high intensity in short time, next to no zone two and very little zone 3 which is where we build endurance.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I was pretty active in CrossFit for years having come from being a runner.  I think this is just a people thing.  People don’t like running.  I always loved seeing running in a workout because I’m a big fan of running.  A lot of folks I used to workout with would do like 3 classes a week and fill the others with endurance sports instead.  

CrossFit as a discipline doesn’t exclude long time dimension endurance stuff at all.  They did a pretty gnarly trail half marathon at the Games one year and Fraser made it look like it was easy because he had trained that stuff.  

What I will say is that CrossFit has a tendency to put muscle on a lot of people and that can definitely be suboptimal for peak performance at cardio based activities like you’re talking about.  For me to be at my best for cycling I need to be about 35 lbs less than I’m naturally at when active in CrossFit.  I could probably stay slimmer, but I’ve always packed on muscle with lifting and all the squats and stuff just blow me up like a balloon.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yup, while I do think CrossFit helped me in road cycling, it was in a more tangential way than how it helped me in team sports. I had to add a bunch of Zone 2 training to the mix before I actually got good at cycling. 


I will say CrossFit helped me to start out stronger than most new cyclists, and to get to the fun parts quicker. Like from the first day I got on my bike, I could average 16 MPH for 30 miles. That's enough to do a B-group ride at the local shop and make bike friends. (This is what I consider the fun parts, group rides and bike friends.) But to actually progress in cycling, I had to add other things besides CrossFit. </div>

The problem is of envy , particularly envy/jealousy about other people's success .

                        <div class="comment-body">I didn’t read the full post, but here’s what I’d say. 

Trust in the universe to take you, where you were meant to be. Whatever was meant for you will come, whatever wasn’t will flee. However, you can chase things not meant for you and put yourself in quite the dilemma. 


I used to be so sad and envious at my middle school football games. Watching all the little boys with loving fathers by their side cheering them on. “Why can’t I have that? Why won’t my dad love me”

Then a few years ago “how come he gets to have such a nice car? He’s my age, why don’t I get to enjoy the finer things?”

Then I realized, it’s quite a sad way of life. I am blessed in many of my own ways, and the more I realized it and became grateful for it, the more I realized the universe is on my side. It’ll help you, bless you, love you, all within signs and synchronicities. 

Now instead, I tear up with tears of joy when seeing things I had wished I had.

 “Look at that dad, loving his son and being there for him. Look how happy and content that kids heart is.” 

How wonderful :)</div>

And while I do understand,  atleast in theory what you are trying to say , it's putting it in practice that's the difficult part . At present , I'm almost reflexive  . Like "Oh he has done/achieved this , so now I must do this to outshine him" , this is my thought process at present.  And I do realize at some level this thinking is unsustainable,  but I can't seem to overcome this.  It's like " Either I have to be better than this person or be perpetually unhappy that he/she is better than me " . So at present it seems it's either the anxiety of trying to be better or dejection that I'm not better . In Either case there's  no peace . 

So how do I get to where you are ? Is it a natural progression or is it something that you did ?</div>

The book says something like it's best to always think of everyone as your equal.

They may not be equal in manifestation, but equal in potential.

I mean, this all sounds nice and dandy, but pretty hard to adhere to in real life.  
Jealousy is just part of the human experience, if you look at it long enough with equanimity and dispassion, its hold on you will lessen.

Acknowledge your jealousy, take an earnest look at it, let it play out, then you can move on.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey mate! Congrats on the first post.

It sounds like you've got a decent amount of experience with meditation or at least the meditation world, so that helps a lot. I don't think you're alone in these struggles at all, I know I've experienced my own form of them, and still do now and again.

Are you familiar with metta and mudita?

If you're not familiar, metta(Loving-Kindness) meditation is the practice of cultivating love and kindness towards ourselves and others. In a way, this is us practicing our relationship with them in their absence. So that when we see them(or others in general) we remember that we care about them and wish for good things to happen to them.

Mudita(Sympathetic Joy) is a little less well known, but is especially good for working with envy and jealousy. The practice here involves wishing happiness on others and finding joy in the happiness they have. In other words, finding happiness in the happiness of others. Through this practice, when people around you succeed, you can find joy rather than jealousy.

In your case practicing Mudita on someone else's success, particularly a success that you're jealous of, might prove difficult. If you decide to explore Mudita, I'd suggest starting with small sources of happiness that you already find it easy to be happy about. Like when someone gets to enjoy the ice cream they've been craving, or they finally get to rest after a long day of work//school, etc. They're simple things, but even starting there helps to flex the mental muscles we need to appreciate the bigger and more difficult to appreciate things.

Anyways, that's the advice I have. If you're interested in learning more, Metta and Mudita are 2 of the 4 immeasurables. The immeasurables are great, life-giving places to rest our minds. And they each work to counter act different harmful habits. Loving Kindness works against Ill WIll, and Mudita works against Jealousy.

Good luck mate!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Hi Ucenna , Thanks for the advise 😊 . It .makes sense . The 2nd exercise that you mention , how should one go about it . And I'll be honest I have in past tried some Meditation.  But what I struggle with , in these mental practices is result.  Like how do I know if it's actually working or if I'm just engaging in self-delusio. Like what if in just engaging in these elaborate rationalization without any meaningful change.  For eg if I fast or I jog regularly, I'll lose weight and I'll be sure it's real and not self-delusion . But with Meditation I'm never sure.  So is there some way to tackle this . 
And being happy for others about something I don't want is easy and I do it often . The problem comes when the other person gets what I Have always wanted . That instantly feels like a competition and source of this unhappiness.</div>

First, the pricing model change which makes them milk the user as Cursor had the monoply and a good product. The funny part is that the price of $200 only and only gives you access to the base model.

Second, the rate limiting issue. No matter which plan you go for they rate limit your request, which means that Ultra plan that I was paying $200 also has rate limiting for using Opus 4 MAX.

                        <div class="comment-body">Very interesting watching how they have handled this. If I was marketing at Cursor, I would change the pricing model like they did, then find out the most influential people discussing Cursor, remove their limits secretly so they can go on YouTube and say "I have no idea how other people are hitting limits, I've been using it for hours and days without hitting a single limit". 

Looks like they have a PR disaster on their hands from all the bad press and now they have been forced to be more transparent and start refunding people. I don't know if admitting they were wrong and refunding will gain the trust of the community back, but time will tell. I think people will still be quite concerned by the number of genuine posts that were taken down by the Cursor mods on the subreddit and the unclear information from the company to begin with. Cursor and Claude Code still seem to be the top products in the space so its possible they recover.</div>

That would've just been another PR disaster when it was inevitably found out. If big creators are sharing experiences that just don't line up with anyone else's, people would notice.</div>

The really sad thing is `Claude Code` is just `Claude Sonnet 4` or `Claude Opus 4` with a slightly better system prompt. `Cursor` had the full package. The best auto-complete, the best UX, all the best frontier models, they supported the major OSes, and a good price. An example of their good UX is the `Restore checkpoint ` feature that is a game changer.

Yet since January they have  been slowly turning up the heat on everyone like we were frogs in the pot that wouldn't notice. They didn't fix  bugs as much as they should have. They kept changing the UI and UX in silly ways. They introduced `MAX` modes which started out useful, and then they turned the pricing into API prices plus markup. Finally they pulled this "unlimited" BS.

On the other hand I think half the problem is OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are all stabbing them via pricing, and competition. The big mistake they made was not selling the company like `Windsurf`.</div>

Companies are competing with each other, so they can't just cut people just because they have become more efficient. For research and development you also wouldn't cut funding just because everything got more efficient, because people would want new scientific breakthroughs as fast as possible, for example getting new cancer treatment or finding new ways to solve climate change.</div>

You mean it succeeded 30 percent of the time? Even with worst case scenario of slow gradual improvements that can go up to 50 percent success rate by the end of this year. 50 fucking percent of real-world office tasks automated away. That is thousands of of hours of work that were done by people before AI. 

I just love the framing of these articles, highlighting the 70 percent failure instead of the 30 percent success as if that 30 percent success is not a huge achievement.

These journalists are really pathetic. I can't really think of a more useless entity than being the guy who writes these stuff.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The problem is that in a lot of business automation even a 90% success rate often isn't good enough. If you have some regulatory responsibility over the data you transmit and you send 100 million messages a year 10% of that being wrong could fuck you.

As a hypothetical think about an ecommerce system that processes orders to go out from a warehouse and it gets 10% or orders wrong. It would be unusable.

Say you try to automate a system that ships medication and it ships the wrong medication 5% of the time. You'd be done for.

You can't iterate over time to get to a 99.9% success rate because you can't just conduct an experiment with your revenue stream failing 70% of the time while you tune it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">They want us to work in mines, in factories, in fields, and enlist in the military. 

The plan is to increase the birth rate for more workers/consumers, remove competition for "bad jobs" (deportation) to remove anyone who cannot work (disabled people) and force women to churn out babies. 

They want us to be so poor and with so few options we have to live in a company town, shop in a company store, and accept a tiny wage. This would enable them to have more growth than is currently possible.

This could, in theory, work for a decade or two tops (in practice there will be uprisings, but let's pretend) The thing is it wouldn't be sustainable even with a docile population because the income/wealth disparity is already SO bad, and will continue to grow, so no one will have money to buy shiny new products.</div>

Health insurance is doing the same thing these days. Something isn't covered that should be? Sorry, AI determined... And we don't know why, but it's obviously correct. 

My company gave me 18 months' worth of Hertz rentals, and the fight to actually get the loyalty points for those rentals was goddamn *exhausting.* They give you a card full of numbers to call at the counter, but they all route to the same, entirely automated phone service that directs you to their website.

trump's converted to judaism. ivanka too, and married a jewish guy. as have bidens kids, chelsea clinton. influence of AIPAC. American Jews in local/regional/national political/legislative/govt positions. that all adds up when it comes to internal influence, votes, legislation, aid, trade, etc

in this mortal realm, it's all about power, control and money. domestically and internationally. the west having a stable ally in the middle east. war/weapons trade is very lucrative business. israel knowing the value of their position, and the cuckability of their god, and whatever kompromat Epstein (and others?) managed to procure, Isr has the US over a barrel. gagged and bound. begging for more.

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; but why 

Epstein &amp; Co blackmail material.  Plus fear of assassination. 

Trump knows Israel is a problem. In his first term Trump said that is an enormous fight. There are many more things to repair first.  

Then the dems stole the 2020 election.  Now it's iffy if Trump &amp; Co will have time to get to the Israel problem. You saw his F-Bomb about Israel and Iran though, saying they'd both been in this stupid war so long "They don't know what the FUCK they're doing!".   

Kinda shows his true feelings about the whole thing.  Just, it won't help if he gets assassinated like they did to JFK. 

They have no Epstein blackmail info on Trump, or it would have been leaked LONG ago. Epstein himself would have pevented Trump from taking down Epstein, Maxwell &amp; Co.  Trump was instrumental in the lawsuit that put Epstein behind bars.  If there was ANY blackmail info against Trump, that would never have happened.

Israel has TONS of blackmail info against so, so many though. Dems, RINOS, tech billionairs, sports, music, oh shit Hollywood! 

If Trump blows the lid off that, he'd better have a rocket ship to Mars planned, becuase ALL the elites would be trying to assassinate him. The "democrat" party leaders have already tried at least 3 times (that we know of).

In reality the AIPAC is a foreign, terrorist organization, waging war against the USA. And they must be treated as such. And again, they have their claws in so deep, all over the world, that is a HUGE fight.</div>

The woman slapping the man after he said he lost attraction.

The man giving the woman silent treatment after she accidentally spilled his water.

The man flirting with another girl at a bar.

I use AI for relationship advice because I'm leaving an abusive, narcissistic husband. It's been my saving grace. I would hate for OP's bullshit to turn someone away from getting the clarity they need in a tough situation. 

I would have never gotten such focused, clear advice without a therapist if I hadn't gone to ChatGPT and asked for help with why my text messages from him and his mother felt off. 

They were emotionally manipulative and nearly worked.

What you’ve described isn’t just a lapse in judgment—it reflects a profound failure of empathy and responsibility. Your wife worked a 12-hour shift, likely exhausted, and rather than supporting her, you chose to betray her trust because your emotional discomfort wasn’t immediately soothed. Feeling sad and alone is human—but choosing to inflict harm on someone who was already stretched thin is not excusable.

Cheating is not a valid response to feeling neglected. If you were hurting, the ethical path would have been communication, reflection, and mutual support—not retaliation disguised as self-soothing.

You owe your wife honesty, and you owe yourself a serious reckoning with the kind of partner you chose to be in that moment. If you're capable of remorse, the next step is not justification—it’s accountability and change."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Project Strawberry and Ilya leaving openAI increased speculation a lot, for a while. o1 was pretty revolutionary 7 months ago. So was o3, and they released its benchmarks almost as soon as they released o1.. DeepSeek being so competitive as an open model increased the speculation, too.

I think the release of 4.5 and 4.1, and the delay in DeepSeek R2, Anthropic having fairly tempered results with Claude 4.. has tempered expectations. Also labs being a bit open about training dates -&gt; release dates, and the race conditions reduce speculation on what is being held back.</div>

I think it's the only subscription service that lets me add repositories to the chat, and it's really good. For example I can add a repository and chat about it with gpt 4.1, then ask it to give me a code snippet from the repo, then ask it how a certain feature is implemented, then give it my own repo, and ask how to implement that feature.

Any other tool would need to download the entire repo, asses the file &amp; folder structure, read the entire codebase and then answer any questions - but any AI model is limited and can't realistically inspect an entire codebase in realtime, because of too high contest.</div>

This is a way for payment processors to sneak unfavorable conversion rates on you (DCC) which can mark up your purchase 5-10% more that it should cost, and it's somehow legal in most of the world. ALWAYS choose to pay in local currency when given a choice. This holds for credit card transactions and even more so for ATMs.

                                <div class="reply-body">Sorry if I wasn't clear enough - the ATM itself typically has two options for currency conversion.  A traveler can be overcharged by both the payment processor (the foreign ATM or the processor used by a local business) AND any credit card foreign transaction fees. Your bank or card issuer doesn't know what fee the ATM or restaurant or shop charges in their own fees and they don't reimburse you. However some cards do have zero or limited foreign transaction fees, which minimizes how much you're double gouged. 

Perhaps you have a card that reimburses for processor fees, but from looking for this for a long time I haven't discovered one.</div>
