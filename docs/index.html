 Ive seen lawsuits like these before, and the truth usually does not matter that much. Two thing matter, whether she actually believes it (where her lawyer will say shes an idiot so of course she believes it, she didnt act with malice), and whether there were damages to Macron (where her lawyer will argue normal people would never trust an idiot like her, and no one interacting with Macron believes it, there are no actual damages). So Candance Owens has huge chances of winning.</div>

                <div class="post-content">After months of feedback from devs juggling multiple chat tools just to break big tasks into smaller steps, we reimagined [Traycer's](https://traycer.ai) workflow as a Kanban-style Phase Board right inside your favorite IDE. The new **Phase** mode turns any large task into a clean sequence of PR‑sized phases you can review and commit one by one.

# How it works

1. **Describe the goal (Task Query)** – In **Phase** mode, type a concise description of what you want to build or change. Example: “Ad...</div>

Donald Trump is a hero.

In order to catch the world's most prolific pedophile, Mr. Trump had to think like a pedophile, act like a pedophile, and become friends with a pedophile.

When he was raping those young girls, he was doing it for us. He was doing it for mankind.

He's a goddamn hero.</div>

So now I prentend my to-do kist belongs to them. What would I tell them to do first? Probably, “hey, just do one thing and take a break.” So I do that, and weirdly it works.

Turns out, I will move mountains for imaginary people but not for myself. 10/10 coping strategy. No notes.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I’ve recently started dropping in at local boxes. I have little motivation to workout at my own. I think it may be the fact that it still feels like work even if I’m not there to coach. 

I feel a little guilty about having a “side-gym” but they’ve been some of my best training sessions and the most fun. 

Wondering if anyone has gone through this and just looking for some feedback and reflection. Thanks</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hi! Fellow coach who doesn't train at the gym i work at for this exact reason! At my original gym in TX, they asked me to coach and I turned it down because I didn't want to make my comfort space a work or stress space. 

I moved to TN and had an opportunity to coach at a different gym than the one I joined. I took it and I do struggle with feeling guilty because crossfit is heavily community based but when I'm feeling tired from work, I don't want to workout at work. So I'm thankful to have the space at the other gym and my basement gym. 

I think when I have more time I'll workout there occasionally because I do love our members but for now it's not usually in the cards.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thanks, this is the kind of reflection I was looking for. I still plan on doing community events and jumping into workouts from time to time. But a place where I am an athlete first has been very rewarding. I don’t feel bad doing the workout in the corner and not socializing if I’m not in the mood that day.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">not a coach but my career is managing rec facilities (gyms, pools), and I am not sure folks understand that that place is "work" for me, and just like everyone else, when the day is done, I want to leave. If I try to work out at work, people always ask me for things, want to talk shop, or I end up working and not exercising.

I always found having a side gym to be what was best for me/my mental health/actually working out. Plus, it helped me see how other facilities are run, helping me to have a better perspective on how my own organization was running! You may find that you hear a good cue, or learn a new way to teach a movement or a new way to scale, which only elevates you as a coach!</div>

The only thing stopping me from switching from Copilot to Roo Code for actual coding is that Roo really falls apart in effectively using the terminal in monorepos. It gets lost as to what directory it's running commands in, the command will fail, and instead of changing the directory it will give up and perform a less effective command (which will also fail.)

Copilot somehow figures this out, and I don't know how (otherwise I'd try to fix it.) Maybe it spits out the directory the shell is currently at and context about the repo into the user prompt it sends to the LLM?</div>

ChatGPT just won gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad using a generalized model, not something specialized for math. The IMO also requires abstract problem solving and generalized knowledge that goes beyond just crunching numbers mindlessly, so I’m thinking AGI is around the corner. 

Maybe around 2030 we’ll have AGI that’s actually deployable at scale. OpenAI’s building their 5GW Star...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Literally, the idea of the singularity is what got one of my friends to reconsider Marx. The singularity is the ultimate final process of humanity's own development rendering both labor and scarcity obsolete. He could not see into the future, but he saw the trends and the nature of power in material terms.

Unfortunately, as many Historical Materialists have described, the ruling class of any society will try to preserve their existence as a ruling class, in this case even if it requires inventing new superfluous jobs consisting of unproductive labor. To oversimplify, that is why he conceived of the working class masses fighting to become the next ruling class, so that this process (that we see culminating in the singularity) can be completed in a more beneficial way than a capitalist society will allow, as the working class can then proceed on their own terms. (As an example, one path socialism could take in regards to the singularity is the working class, in its own self-interest as a ruling class, develops the infrastructure to reduce work hours and increase pay, all the way up until post-scarcity renders material classes in such a society obsolete.)

Whether or not someone agrees with everything else, one must accept that a materially wealth-controlling ruling class, as is the norm for capitalism and most prior forms of society, will not allow the singularity to be completely unleashed for the benefit of all.</div>

The capitalism/socialist fusion states like the northern Europeans probably have the closest thing to a decent system, but they also benefit from racial homogeneity and natural resources.</div>

If this is true, then whenever this Advanced Deep Think $250/month model is released, it will be borderline AGI level, and a superintelligence in narrow domains. 

Imagine a general purpose model with IMO Gold Performance with similar performance in computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, philosophy, literature, arts, etc. 

Hopefully this isn't just hype. It is a bit odd that they're not showing what this model can do in subje...</div>

this is potentially emergent internal abstraction though, which is one of the holy grails. it depends how much prompt scaffolding was done. if they really did just point the model at the problems and say 'go', it's a big deal. I'm not sure that actually happened though</div>

So I started trying meditation because I feel stressed a lot and people say it helps. But when I sit down and close my eyes… my brain just starts talking a lot 

Like “what should I eat later?” or “did I send that message?” or random songs in my head 

Is this normal? Am I doing it wrong? I just breathe and try to focus but it’s hard to stay still.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is common for beginners. It happens because you are training your awareness. You are becoming aware of the mental chatter that was already there, something that was previously in the background and you may not have noticed.

When you realize this mind chatter, simply and gently acknowledge it, attempt to gently let go and gently redirect your attention to the meditation object (e.g. sensations of breath at the tip of the nose). Any time your mind wanders and you notice that, just repeat the acknowledgement and gentle redirection. Don't force anything. Think of it like collecting together some puppies, which will then naturally wander at some point, so you do it again, gently.

As you repeatedly do this you are building up the mental faculties of monitoring what is happening in your consciousness, and alerting you when attention slips from the meditation object, etc. It's a bit like building muscle in the gym, it takes time and you need to put in the reps. Just like the gym, some days are going to be better and some worse, but in average the trend is improving. In a few days/weeks and especially months, you are going notice changes (compared to when you started).</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It’s okay to have different thoughts. Meditation is not about the absence of thoughts. It’s about understanding what caused them, accepting them, and allowing them to be with you during meditation.  
Every meditation session (and any other technique) is different and depends on our current mental and emotional state.  
One piece of advice: allow yourself to feel and think without expecting anything. Keep your attention on your feelings and sensations. And each time you lose focus, simply start over.

Good luck.</div>

Not sure how you'd ever get the 3.5 v6 into the Gr86. The engine bay is very tight from top to bottom so anything bigger than an LS (insane small for it's displacement) would fit.</div>

The origins of the red neck and hill billies come from Billy Fullartons, Billy Boys gang from Glasgow.

These were Protestants who left Scotland and ended up in the outback of the US. 

They were so deranged that the term Hill Billies was made for them.

The saying "you couldn't mark his neck with a blow torch" is a reference to the way these hill Billy, Red necks behaved. They were filth.</div>
