                <div class="post-content">Upgraded to Plus 2 days ago. Used codex in vs code for a couple hours first day, about 4 hours yesterday, possibly 5ish hours today. Hit with a rate limit that resets in 4 days and 15 hours. 

Question - is it worth upgrading to Pro, or should I purchase multiple Plus accounts and continue using codex that way? Is this even permissible or warrant a ban of any kind?

Just wish they’d offer a plan at the $100 mark!

I haven't seen this mentioned here yet, but Japan has had far more access to the Prelude for whatever reason. So far the impressions seem positive. You can use YouTube's translation features if you don't speak Japanese.

Some highlights:

It will probably be considered a success if it moves a few thousand units a year. I expect it to be more expensive than people want, but so is everything else.

We should be happy that Honda is making an interesting and different runabout. This style of car doesn’t exist much anymore.

Feels almost like this recipe is closer to a Mazda 3 Turbo. Different tradeoffs, better fuel economy and fewer doors. But kind of that same low key GT concept that’s kind of cool that people struggle to classify.</div>

If you tell them to disconnect on let’s say the 21 of the month, because you’re working until then, there is a risk they disconnect earlier than that date.


They won’t deny they made a mistake but they’ll tell you they can do nothing, they can’t reactivate without a technician coming out and they’ll have to charge you for all expenses incurred.


It sucks, it is not fair, it shouldn’t be legal, but you should just wait until after ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Back in the late 2000s here in Canada unlimited GB usage plans were either expensive or non-existent, and unfortunately our telecom industry was (and still currently is) practically a monopoly. This means that not only did you have to watch your internet usage, but had to pay an outrageous amount if you went over your monthly allocation.  
  
I decided to cancel my plan when I was getting ready to move, but on the last month of my plan... their usage tracking website conveniently stopped working. I called them and they straight up told me the tracker won't work for accounts that were flagged to be closed. Lo and behold somehow my internet usage went $300+ over my regular plan on my last bill. I kept calling to complain but they kept saying the charges were from legitimate usage.  
  
I let them take it to collections and just ignored the calls until they went away. Luckily I was in my early 20s and the hit to my credit was easier to take than cough up $300 on minimum wage part time hours.</div>

**Why not the $200 plan:** Model has way too much capability. It can do a lot. More than what you can monitor, manage, and carefully prompt. At that point, you go full on "create a full fledge gazillion dollar app that does everything." With a prompt like that and s#$t ton of credits, the model starts...</div>

Just wondering, how long did it take you guys before it finally started to click?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree. I tasked people with trying to find the AI music hidden in between real music (that they did not know). They *where* still better then chance (my sample was very small, both in people and in songs), it was about 60/40, but with the speed this is going, it's basically a done deal this year.


Try it out yourself. Grab random music in a genre and generate music with the latest model in the same genre. Go ahead and cherrypick, we are not saying *every* ai generated song will pass the Turing test yet. Make a small playlist.


Randomly shuffle the music and let people listen and guess.


Depending on your prompting technique your milage may very, but it's somewhat fun (and horrible) to see their faces sink when they realise how difficult of a task this is becoming.


Also have tissues on hand. One of my relatives had a bit of a crisis as she was thinking of a young friend who is trying to become a musician.</div>

Compared to 1 year ago what I noticed is that the vocals that have improved like crazy. I think that was probably the most important part if you want to make Billboard Hot 100 music.</div>

These tools aren’t magicians (yet), but they can create faster, cheaper, more efficient means of production when integrated into existing pipelines

The win here is cutting production time down by 70-80% and saving $10-40mm depending on how good it turns out.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I tried putting myself into the mindset of watching Toy Story or some 80s 3D Short for the first time. While it looked basic compared to today’s CGI it was clear that it looked *unique*. That there were things you could do with lighting, camera work and physics simulation that weren’t possible before. Even when still rough, CGI clearly *added* something. 

The problem with AI slop is that it is, almost by definition, *not new*. It is the most obvious imitation of described content that already exists. The default Pixar look. The deviantart fantasy concept. The big budget Hollywood concept art idea of sci-fi. Only that you can perceived where it is stitched together at the seams, not any sharp, obvious lines but mushy, dreamy blending of well-established cliches. 

You look at “Critterz” and it’s the off-brand Dreamworks look, the Where the Wild Things Are rip-off. It looks *generic*, we found the algorithmic definition of “generic”. Toy Story, in comparison, was unlike anything seen before. 

When I go and watch a movie, I want to see something *new*. Even if it’s an established franchise, almost every good movie, even rather corporate stuff, tends to show things that have never been put on a screen before. There might be generic filler (and that’s often the main complaint of critics) but what counts is the fresh, new stuff. I don’t really see how AI, whose whole trick is always giving the most obvious output, can solve that. It might be ideal for, say, changing the lighting in a shot or replacing the face of a stuntman in post production. But how on earth would you use it for an actually creative process? How could you prompt something that is not in the training data?</div>

Now they have Trump…

Deploying troops into cities, military parades, shooting down Iranian missiles, etc

All of those things cost insane money and could have been avoided. Pair that with a spending bill that adds trillions to the deficit and now you have the most financially irresponsible president we’ve ever had.

MAGA voters never considered that somebody who bankrupted several businesses shouldn’t be considered an elite businessman.

Alright, I need to rant and see if I'm going crazy or if anyone else is experiencing this.

I've been a pretty big defender of ChatGPT for a while. When the last wave of negativity hit, I was always the one in the comments saying, "Guys, you just have to write a better prompt," or "It's a model, it needs to be trained and fine-tuned, you have to give it context and get it familiar with your style."

But this... this is something else entirely.

It has also been condescending and tries to correct me in a specific question and will ignore direct prompts to not do something and also ignore my request to answer why they just did something and will try to correct instead - when I say don’t correct, tell me why you just did xyz.

I tell it never to do that, to just tell me when it can't find info. I then ask the original question again and it does the same thing, making stuff up. Summer 2024.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It did for me! I had insomnia for decades, lost jobs &amp; friendships, my cortisol was through the roof

It took a long time &amp; lots of practice but, eventually, the constant chatter (&amp; sometimes outright screaming) in my head lessened enough to actually enjoy the quiet! Then I began to have incredible spiritual experiences where I left my body occasionally &amp; the constant grind of my thoughts faded even more. Keep practicing. Every minute trying matters. It can be very difficult &amp; challenging for overthinkers &amp; intrusive thought sufferers. Consistency matters. Do it daily. You are not your thoughts, your body, your emotions, but something so much more. Meditation is an excellent way to find you.

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes, Claude Code can talk to Codex using Codex MCP built into the CLI.

In your prompt, you can say something like - “Use Codex MCP for architecture descisions” or “use codex as a consultant.”

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes.  What is your goal?  Codex CLI has a MCP function.  It didn’t support Claude Code, but if you look for a PR under my name you can find a link to the changes I used. I haven’t pushed a release for the latest version, but if there is interest I can.  It’s pretty neat.  The most effective way to use it is to create an agent and explain how to use it and then tell Claude why to call the agent.

Using Claude in Codex is a little more of a pain.  Codex CLI uses a sandbox (at least on macOS) that messes with even MCP permissions.  I did write some stuff to make it work, including a bridge MCP instead of a direct one, but ultimately I was never happy with it and I don’t think I published it.  

I‘ve been using Codex alone mostly lately and getting better results.  I need to try to fiddle a little more :)</div>
