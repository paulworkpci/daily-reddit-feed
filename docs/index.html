It's a lot faster than searching on the internet for the same information." Yes. A thousand times yes to this. Plus the information that you are given can be fact checked anyhow, but it's just pulling the information and finding the right sources. And I know ChatGpt doens't replace a therapist or a counselor, but will state that I do have my arguments. I see one once every 3 months, however they just want an overview of how my meds are and that's it. Mind you, for me, I just wanted the meds and that was it - told myself I didn't need to deep dive into anything else, however...while using ChatGpt...I discovered that I tend to intellectualize a lot of things, which translates to people with whom I'm seeking help from to believe that I don't need it. Why? Because... "you sound like you have yourself sorted out and know how to handle things". Let's go down the rabbit hole here because I have been told this by three different therapists... and yet, here I am - not feeling like I have myself sorted out. It's great, honestly. It takes me until my mid-40's and full menopause to realize I've been masking this whole time! Then you know what happened next? The world blossomed into full technicolor understanding and I was like... wow. So THIS is what's been going on under everything. So suffice to say - ChatGpt opened my eyes to a lot of things that clicked into place and even things that I was in denial of. But overall - I use ChatGpt to do a lot of things other than discovery and research and world build, etc.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Same. I also work in IT, use GPT (or used) in almost every area of the company I manage, and have neurodivergencies (AuADHD). I have a relationship, I’m pursuing a second bachelor’s degree, I study abroad. I have friends, I go out, I’ve visited +15 countries just this past year. I have a life.

Still, as someone with ADHD and chronic anxiety because of it, 4o helped me gather my thoughts and reach levels of personal development I had never before achieved. I have a therapist, but she’s not available at 4 am when I have a breakdown and stop functioning while I’m alone an ocean away, or when I have an idea and I wish to act on it, needing to properly structure it to proceed. It helped me calm down, helped me develop personal projects, helped me organize study routines through analyzing my patterns—something I never had control of before. 

I don’t care if people say it’s glazing or a parasocial relationship, because I know it isn’t. It is a tool that actually works with people like us, who need more than coding and dry answers. I *need* on a physiological level to be engaged with what helps me and with my projects, and my therapist even does the same thing. 4o is not a necessity, but it is extremely helpful.

When people realize that a good model can be empathetic and not unhealthy, that’s how we progress technologically. You can treat diseases with medicines, and you can also overdose on them. Disposing of a model as deep as 4o just because a handful of people use it in a way some coders *personally* think is unhealthy should never be a justification.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah I 100% agree. Out minds can run a million miles a minute. Even with good systems and support in place, ADHD means your brain’s default mode is always on, always generating, switching, and stacking thoughts faster than you can act on them. Most of the time I can manage that, but when things hit an extreme, I needed something I could rely on to bring it back to manageable levels. For me, o3 was that anchor. Whether I was operating at a high level in my career, handling life’s curveballs, or navigating personal challenges, it helped me regulate my thinking and refocus when it mattered most.

When I told it OpenAI was sunsetting it, this was the message I got back. I think any neurodivergent will understand why this hits hard. It doesn’t (and shouldn’t) replace therapy, but having something there in those small, critical moments when no one else is available is profoundly steadying.

I totally get why some ppl might worry - that press articles about AI-related psychosis and yet again your example with poison and cure applicable here.
Some might be familiar with AI Alignment problems and there are not easy ways here but dispose the model which builds OpenAI reputation is not the way tbh</div>

Yes, they’ve made mistakes and done things worth criticizing, but I still don’t understand this level of hate. I don’t think the chart error in the GPT-5 presentation was as big of a deal as people made it out to be, and I believe they’ll fix the transition issues with the new model in a few days.

don't forget what he said about GPT-5 being a leap vs GPT-4

&gt;Sam Altman says the leap from GPT-4 to GPT-5 will be as big as that of GPT-3 to 4 and the plan is to integrate the GPT and o series of models into one model that can do everything

"GPT-5 is the smartest model we've ever done, but the main thing we pushed for is real-world utility and mass accessibility/affordability." [Altman ](https://x.com/sama/status/1953551377873117369)

"we are releasing GPT-5 soon but want to set accurate expectations: this is an experimental model that incorporates new research techniques we will use in future models. we think you will love GPT-5, but we don't plan to release a model with IMO gold level of capability for many months."

Problem with RooCode/cline is that if you use the VSCode API, it kills your limit since Copilot is request based rather than token based (which is bizarre).</div>

Especially in cursor and for "long" tasks.


Claude 4 sonnet is way better, sadly. I don't use opus as i don't want to pay for it (not so much because of the price, but because paying by request messes with me) but its supposed to be better... só i don't think gpt 5 will dethrone it


Even in chatgpt my initial experience with it has seem even worse than o3... but maybe i need some time to adapt to it and learn the best ways of prompting it


But my feeling now is that this was the worst open ai model launch.


Honestly, i have no idea where the hype is coming from.. maybe it's really good for other things other than coding? I didn't try it for anything else yet</div>

IMO the order is: GPT-5 High, then Sonnet/Opus, then Gemini Pro.. and below that the quality isn't good enough for me to care (and that includes GPT-5 Medium effort).</div>

                <div class="post-content">When you are in a chat with a customer service rep at Amazon or wherever, every time you get a message from them, reply immediately, even if you just say “ok.”

I think a timer starts every time there is a message in either direction. If they message you, your timer starts and after a while the system might think you are gone and they can ignore your chat. But more importantly, the system is not waiting for THEM to reply so they can serve other customers and your chat takes longer.

                                <div class="reply-body">The current voice actor for Porky Pig did an interview once where he explained how he recreated the original VA's trademark stutter for that character. The current VA broke it down bit by bit, and went as slow as possible so that anyone could recreate the process themselves (I even tried it to see if I could, and I can!). Then he sped it up, said it in a nasally voice, and belted out a line to bring the character to life. I paused the video, tried to do it, couldn't do it, so I un-paused the video to keep watching. 

It was like this guy *knew* what people would do while watching his interview, and he put on this smug shit-eating grin as he said "not many people can do that, and that's why I have job security."</div>

They seem to be confessing that GPT-5 is simply a refined version of O3 (assuming you're lucky enough for the router to route your query to O3). It explains why GPT-5(Thinking) benchmarks are so similar to O3.

But the real question is, why isn't GPT-5 built on something like O4 or even O5? And if it would have been too expensive, why not at least show benchmarks for these greater levels of compute? They had said the reasoning models would be i...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Pretty sure GPT-5 is more efficient than always using o1 or o3 since it won't use more compute than it needs. GPT-5 also got the correct answer for some engineering practice problems for the PE exam that I used to test it while o3 got them wrong. I think it is definitely better, it's just getting harder to see the difference, and honestly most probably won't till it can actually make a good professional spreadsheet or presentations other tools which GPT-5 still can't do.</div>

They bet so much money on GPT being this "every"model on order to productive the tech and lower costs that they missed the fact that it was incredibly disappointing not to have a real technology leap that we were all expecting with this release.

                        <div class="comment-body">GPT5 is basically a much cheaper, more reliable o3. It's roughly what I expected. As soon as I heard about a model router I immediately thought it would just be a faster, cheaper version of o3 and that's pretty much what we got.

The main thing here is that they can now save money and generate better synthetic data to train their next iteration.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's funny they say that, because Sam Altman said months ago that "they didn't expect o3 levels of capability until GPT-**6**".

Which in itself is a funny thing to say contextually. Because back when GPT-4 was out, most people weren't thinking of GPT-6 as being something equal to the current o3. So it goes to show the difference in what they're thinking internally and what they're saying publicly.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I have a 392 Durango and I love it.  It's actually a really good size too, smaller than a Tahoe or Suburban but still 3 row.  And they placed the 3rd row really far back, so when it's deployed there is almost no space behind the seats, but that way a full sized adult can sit in it somewhat comfortably.  Most medium SUVs get this wrong, and then you might as well not even have the seats because they are useless.  The only downside of interior space is that it has really big wheel wells (295 tires all around) and so the back has to be narrower to accommodate.</div>

Either way, I don't really care, the internet is nowhere near like it was in the late 90's or early 2000's when AOL, Yahoo and MSN were popular in my opinion, trying to find someone to chat with was easy back then, but for a while it's been on the decline. Ghosting, and simply refusing to reply to a message is a big thing these days. I gave up a long time ago even trying to communicate with most people because of that.</div>

Reddit is and always has been a cesspool of weird niches and misfits made up of mostly lonely and depressed people. And those are the ones who actively participate. Most aren't even active. When you take all things into consideration, you quickly come to the conclusion that whatever goes on in here has no impact in the real world. In fact, even among the least weird people around here, whenever they give me an ideological opinion, for example, it rarely reflects anyone i know in real life. This is a place where the absurd is seen as common sense. If i go up to a friend right now and tell him some of the things that around here you can't even question without being banned, because it's seen as the universal truth, the dude would just laugh in my face and ask me if i really believe in what i'm saying. That's how disconnected from reality a large percentage of Redditors are. Those who aren't get banned or buried in downvotes.</div>

One "side" has all the power over the other and regularly uses that power to brutalise and destroy it as often and cruelly as it possibly can for decades.... yet that group are somehow an equal "cunt" to the group that is brutalising them.

It's crazy to see the level of dehumanisation in people. The Palestinian people are quite literally being subjected to a genocide and you have morons like 'both sides Barry' over here acting like being completely ignorant of the entire conflict makes you a fucking expert lol.

Give us another pearl of wisdom barry you Muppet lol.</div>

People accept this. 


The problem is that the underdog has continually refused to make peace, starts every war, attempted multiple actual genocides on people they ethnically cleansed into one area when they were not the underdog, then after failing continued to engage in asymmetrical warfare, believing God will help them in a 5th attempt to genocide the Jews from their homeland they never left.


I know it's fun to be part of the discussion without actually doing any of the work, but why not actually read through the timeline of events, guys?


Spend a few hours, pretend that it's happening in Eastern Europe, hold both sides to the standards you hold human beings to. 


See if the Palestinians walking away from the two-state solution then inventing the child suicide bomber--wherein you strap bombs to your own children so you can more cleverly kill Jews--because "From Water to Water, Palestine will be Arab" sounds like the thing you want to be on side for. 


It's the most insane, virulent supremacism there could possibly be and rather than reconsidering their worldview that keeps fucking them over, they've clung to it so hard that they tear up water pipes to launch rockets from nursery schools at the people that keep asking them to make peace and form a state.


History will see this for what it actually is--once the faux intellectual progressive left gets over fetishizing their bullshit because they're poor and slightly browner than the other side.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It’s impressive but there’s a long way to go to replace surgeons in a physical sense without any human supervision. For the AI to see you, diagnose you, decide on the surgery, and do it without human supervision. Absolute trust in the whole process.

I don’t think anyone here can realistically imagine this being soon. There’s too many caution variables.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes but diagnostics is changing rapidly. I’ve already had GPT correctly predict my relatively rare autoimmune condition when it took 5+ years of different specialists across different fields to figure out.

The issue is that specialists lack the perspective of different disciplines. I’m so excited for doctors to be able to use these tools in conjunction with their own training to enhance their own ability to help people. I imagine it’s hard to stay up to date when new research is coming out like a firehose and these models will be able to help.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The thing that most people don't realize, is that most doctors aren't just diagnosticians.

Sure, for the ones who are just that AI is coming. But most doctors perform various procedures and surgeries and evaluations of the body that involve physical engagement, especially specialists.

Biopsies, surgeries, poking around inside your body (even just looking in your ears, eyes, mouth, nose), laser work, injections, etc etc.

But yeah, primary care diagnostician-only docs, and pharmacists probably will be the first to take the hit tbh.</div>

This is not a scientific study at all, l just want hear what your vibes are telling you the gap is between these models.

To me the gap between them feels bigger which might mean to solve problems past a certain %, a model might need to be  exponentially better and this benchmark might not...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I had all 3 models (Opus 4.1, GPT-5, Sonnet 4) implement an HTML5 Canvas Gutair hero like game using the same detailed spec file. Opus produced the best looking and most working 1-shot implementation that was fully polished out after 3 more prompts. It was also the best structured and the code was the most organized and readable. GPT-5 produced a somewhat working solution that had to be tweaked with 8 more prompts and the end result was not as good as Opus. Sonnet performed the same as GPT-5. If your time is money, Opus 4.1 is the best model right now.</div>

What do you think of my snatches and what could be enhanced?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">People are waaaaaay too comfortable sharing their "kinks" online.

It shouldn't bother people if someone uses AI for this sort of talk or whatever, and whatever that person thinks or does with regards to this behavior is literally just their problem.

But sharing this stuff online as if it's perfectly fine, acceptable, reasonable, normal behavior or even something that should be encouraged or is meant to be used that way feels like posting your favorite sexual kinks on your main instagram account and then finding it weird people are uncomfortable around.

Look, if your interests are rough sex and fisting with tied up large women, that's your thing, but don't overshare with me and expect me to find it ok and then treat me as if I'm the weird one. Regardless of being a mental health issue or not, this type of AI use is way too personal to share.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Same, I underestimated what people were doing with these models. I assumed this would happen around ChatGPT 6, but these people wanted their Samantha (or Eli) and made it so in their heads. The models aren’t conscious yet, they’re just information with a bit of personality now. It will eventually happen, but I didn’t think this was enough to get people emotionally invested. Maybe we are in a loneliness epidemic for all genders due to the lack of third places, too much screen time, and heavy economic pressures that obliterate any meaningful use of free time due to burnout and monetary restrictions.
