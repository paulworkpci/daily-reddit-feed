A 10-year-old person can multiply numbers of any size just by knowing the rules of multiplication from place to place and using a piece of paper. Why can't an LLM do this yet?

We have different answers from multiple Fed bodies, and local government. All in real time. The "THERE" is There so to speak, I mean at this point, who knows about aliens or ufos,I just want to know why our taxes can't get really simple answers about things in our controlled airspace.

The FAA not knowing about every drone flight isn’t shocking because people fly drones illegally all the time. But instead of accepting the obvious, the UFO crowd clings to vague statements and acts like it’s some deep conspiracy. It’s always the same pattern: take a mundane event, ignore the logical explanation, and turn it into “UAP disclosure.”💤</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’d expect them to introduce friction and confusion amongst allies, major trading partners, and at home, degrade and dismantle major institutions like in the FBI, CIA, and NIH so they cannot get a see what is going on, take a foreign policy stance regarding Ukraine that is in Russia’s favor, further exacerbate domestic issues to distract and pin the people against each other, and pin more blame to groups other than Russia like Mexico and China.

That way, Russia can move and act more freely without the US knowing or even being able to do anything and the US will have lost their capacity to function for years-decades at best.

We’re ripe for a massive increase in corruption because key groups with oversight capabilities are being done away with. FBI are being degraded, so we won’t even know let alone measure what is going on. NIH is being degraded, so we are losing our key health surveillance and research infrastructure to address chronic illnesses and new infectious disease we know are coming our way. Musk even took aim at major US defense programs like the F35, which we know is accumulating strong evidence of its effectiveness as Allied countries have shown, so the military may well be degraded too on top of things.

Russian agent or simply corrupt and unhinged (why not both?), the Trump administration is in the process of doing, and has done, more damage to us than our adversaries could do alone.</div>

                <div class="post-content">No social media platforms truly foster real social connections. Facebook mainly involves sharing recycled memes and reacting to posts, masquerading as friendship. Similarly, Snapchat revolves around users sending photos of their foreheads just to maintain streaks. Instagram mirrors Facebook, with users liking and following strangers rather than genuine friends. It's a sad reality that social media dominates our lives, yet we've never been more disconnected from each other.</div>

Now, your feed changes every time you refresh, with a bunch of posts from accounts you don’t even follow.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Democrats need to capitalize by also going on his podcast. Dude this is exactly where Dems fucked up during the last 4 years. The only Democrat that saw the value of spaces like the one Joe had created was Bernie, but for some stupid reason, Dems saw Rogan as lesser than or whatever and would write off anyone that would dare make an appearance on his show. This led to basically no mainstream Democrats going on major podcasts out of fear it would be career suicide and essentially handed Rogan over to the Republicans.

Remember, he actually used to have a pretty decent amount of left wing guests. It might not have been a perfect 50/50 balance, but it was the left who went out of its way to avoid him as the years went on.</div>

I was a good student but i gave up during my final year in high-school. I didn't manage to get accepted in a university (I'm not from the US), so i just said to myself that I'll work first until i find something that interests me. 

Unfortunately i haven't really found a passion. There isn't s...</div>

There is no rule that says you need a singular passion. There is no rule about anything aside from treating yourself with value. So, medical and mental health as needed, available, and accessible. 

That said you could give yourself one assignment: look into a new skill set or career each week. Try coding. Then try art. Next try cooking. Then maybe health care. You could try things practically (like coding or cooking) or just do a deep dive researching different roles in each industry. 

Read. Anything and everything. When something hits your fancy, take the side quest and see what you learn. 

When the negative thoughts creep back, write it down and examine it like a scientist. CSI that shit until it’s quiet.

Take all the energy you’re using to tell yourself what you can’t do and turn it your super learning machine. If you fill your head with interesting stuff and new ideas, you’ll forget the lies that capitalism tells you. 

And you may find you’re a person of many skills and a multitude of passions.

Recap: value yourself, get help where you can, learn all the things, and leave no space for your negative voice. 

There is no clock.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It sounds like you’re describing how i feel and i am 3 years older than you, i tell you it doesn’t get any better if we keep considering age, i you ignore your age (the number) and just follow your instincts and do what your guts tell you is right then that’s the right thing, as my sister once told me ‘we are a generation that mostly lives in their head more than irl’

So nothing is ticking, we are deluded, if you health is fine, your sight is fine, your back doesn’t crack then go out and persue a career even if it feels bigger than you can handle because your vision will change overtime and you will realise that you can handle it.

I can add an advise, since you struggle with adhd and short attention span go for a career that relies less on concentrating or using your brain constantly and there so many of those which pay good. In hospitality, inspecting…
Just do research depending on where you are now and study the market and after finding something interesting you can go to college for and get a bachelor while also working around that field, it’ll help you grow as a person a lot! Good luck</div>

It's like puzzle solving. Each address you essentially do the same thing - spray paint where the utilities are.  But the puzzle part is that no two addresses are ever the same. And you are literally like following a treasure map, just marking the dirt and enjoying the day.  

Of course I don't suggest this job if you live in a snowy area.</div>

Eventually a time will come where an average person can have a version of an AI model capable of AGI on their own computers.

You can't control that, and it's delusional to think you can. You can put as many safety guardrails in place as you want, but ultimately a determined person will find a way to circumvent it.

The UK is going to be left in the dust with their regulations on AI, and they know that. Anthropic seems like the company taking the most safety precautions, so they're wise to partner with them.

All we can do is make the best version of AI that we can and have it combat any individual using an AI system for evil. This is the same with all potential weapons that exist.</div>

Alan Turing (1912-1954) was a British mathematician, logician, and computer scientist, often called the father of modern computing.
Key Contributions:

1. Turing Machine (1936) - He developed a theoretical model for computation, proving that a machine could solve any problem given the right algorithm and enough time. This concept is the foundation of modern computers.

2. Codebreaking at Bletchley Park (WWII) - Turing played a crucial role in breaking the German Enigma cipher, significantly shortening the war and saving millions of lives. He designed the Bombe, a machine that automated codebreaking.

3. Early Computer Development - After the war, he worked on some of the first stored-program computers, including the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory.

4. Artificial Intelligence - He proposed the Turing Test (1950) to determine if a machine could exhibit human-like intelligence, laying the groundwork for Al.
5. Mathematical Biology - In his later years, he studied morphogenesis (how patterns form in nature), influencing modern biology.

Tragic End &amp; Legacy

Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for being gay (which was illegal in the UK at the time) and was chemically castrated. He died in 1954, likely by suicide.
In 2013, the British government posthumously pardoned him, and in 2021, he was honored on the UK £50 banknote. His work remains fundamental to computing, cryptography, and artificial intelligence.</div>

Depends on what you pay them, if you pay the indian equivalent of the lowest coding sweatshop wages which is around 4k usd a year. You are only going to get the ones that are terrible and can be replaced by AI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Technology needs time from development to be actually implemented. 

The F-35, a machine more potent than the F-16, had its first flight back in 2006, was introduced in 2015, and still, as of 2025, hasn't fully replaced the F-16. 

Of course switching from one jet to another is much expensive an undertaking, and production takes a lot of time, so yes, for AI it will go much faster. 
Still it takes time from having some technology and implementing it to a noticable degree.

But I believe that in the near future, thanks to convenience, as well as benefits from developed countries, companies in said countries will rather have 20 employees and a bunch of AI than 200 employees overseas.</div>

If that person isn't killed outright, that person is going to end up under the prison likely with some very bad men who needs a "girlfriend". And he will be slammed as being a Nazi terrorist or something. And his family will be made into pariahs too. Even peaceful protest of this can be a rather dangerous move. Most people want to begrudgingly schlep through another workday and come home to watch Netflix in the evening and don't want to rock the boat to the point of ending themselves.

                                <div class="reply-body">So the “team that made Alpha Go” is DeepMind, a research institute acquired by Google in 2014.  DeepMind also brought us AIAYN and BERT.  

The issue with doing protein folding computationally didn’t necessarily have to do with the complexity.  The biggest issue is that we didn’t have a good distance metric to compare proteins.  That, coupled with an absolutely massive search space, means we were stuck with very slow Monte Carlo like approaches.

The biggest breakthrough in ML for protein folding, at least in my opinion, was ProtTrans.  The first iteration of AlphaFold was pretty meh.  Then came ProtTrans, a multinational effort to pretrain what are now called “foundation models” on the entire Protein Data Bank.  ProtTrans open sourced 2 autoregressive models and 4 encoders.  

The encoder models gave us fast and a reliable way to compare proteins using a well behaved metric.  Another similar problem was Chinese character word segmentation that transformers have essentially solved.

Google’s DeepMind took ProtTrans and tweaked it a bit for the second iteration of AlphaFold and then publicized the hell out of it.</div>

Oh god I hope that isn't true. Relationshipadvice is one of the most toxic subs on this site. I'm not even joking. Some off the most prevalent posters giving out advice are extremely jaded.  

FWIW, it's given me good insight in the past.</div>

If all you do is spout shit about your partner and give a one sided perspective, ChatGPT will basically always agree with you. It's a sycophant through and through.   
  
If you were to give the exact same story from her partners side it would 100% agree with whatever it felt like he wanted from the relationship too.</div>

The way its hips are swaying as it walks, the way it can shift balance to one leg and then re-balance, the way its hips can pivot and shift the direction of its upper body, and so on.  These are the things that will determine whether they are useful and just how useful they could be.</div>

Yeah.  What does that even mean as a criticism?

It's displaying complex movement that a human would do, or pretty close to it.  This level of dexterity has never been achieved before.

Obviously getting them to do useful stuff if a separate task but the range of movement is basically no longer a barrier to that.</div>

There are more clear examples out there of the Unitree bots. Here CNet coverage from 12 days ago: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jylMk0qbDjc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jylMk0qbDjc)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean, these movements are *literally* computer generated:

The dance movements are first uploaded to the computer using human body tracking or from videos of real people dancing (real-to-sim)

Then the algorithm learns to mimic the movements using the robot's own servos and joints in the simulation (sim training)

Finally the algorithm is uploaded to the physical robot body and displayed in the real world (sim-to-real)

So the fact that the robot movements look like CGI is just a result of the dance moves being pre-trained on a computer. Not surprising at all.</div>
