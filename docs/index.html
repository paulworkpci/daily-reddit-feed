yes immoral people exist, yes we need to remain alert, but that does not mean that *all* politicians are only bad

in fact, west became as advanced as it is because *just* enough people believed in doing good for the sake of it.

'the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either - but right through every human heart'</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Safety is an illusion. We will have to build defenses, not try to rely on attempts at safety. 

In a world where anyone will be able to build a super intelligence, safety consists of having an ASI on your side watching your back already. That's the only safety possible. 

If we sit out here hoping that people will only build safe AI, that will be like the frog riding the scorpion's back, a naive move. 

There is no future where everyone respects safety, so we better start figuring out how we deal with unsafe ASI in the mix now. 

The biggest factor going for us is that far more people will be willing to pay for safe AI than unsafe. Safe AI will have a massive compute advantage. 

Where that breaks down is that governments will be building unsafe AI for their own purposes. We cannot rely on them therefore, they could be undermined from within by the very intelligences they build to attack enemies. 

Would be rather ironic to find out that, say, China gets taken out from within by its own attack AI one day.</div>

Submission statement

Some quotes from the video:

&gt; Coulthart: "I don't think people have fully realized yet, he [barber]'s got millions of dollars in private Equity funding from the big end of town, who know the official story is BS, they know the public are being lied to"

&gt; Coulthart: "I went to a conference at Esalen south of San Francisco, which was a very restricted, very high security conference, attended by some very, very high net worth people and some of the top scientists on this subject from all over the world"

&gt; Coulthart: "And I was blown away by the interest from high level Silicon Valley people who clearly know categorically that there's a coverup and they think it's hilarious and amusing that the public is still allowing itself to be mislead and deceived.

&gt; Coulthart: "And they're operating on the assumption that it's real and positioning themselves by investing in Sky Watcher so that they can basically be there to develop what the US has kept secret quite improperly for 60, 70 years"

&gt; Coulthart: "And there's nothing stopping them from developing that technology. And I mean, that's the exciting thing is that, you know, there's a real probability now that the materials science technology will be out in the public domain"

&gt; Coulthart: "And more importantly, what you'll see, and I've spoken to people in the legacy program who've told me they wanna do this, as soon as they see a private enterprise company in a public way working on the material science behind these objects, they're gonna jump from the legacy program and come and help. They want to go and work. They might not go public, but they want to go and work for these new companies"

It's been claimed numerous times and yet any crafts that have been 'recovered' seem to be crashes with no human involvement. Don't forget, it's extremely easy to lie in this crowded claims space even amongst the truth. The human side of things is not nearly as powerful as people like to believe, even those involved in The Program. Human hubris continues to taint this topic.</div>

No.

People in an emotional state following another vehicle will develop tunnel vision and forget all traffic laws. You will blow stop signs. You will follow me right through an intersection even if the light has already turned red for you. And you will slam into the back of the ambulance if we need to make a sudden stop.

                                <div class="reply-body">I have been that EMT.

I specifically told someone: I'll be breaking a few traffic rules, but I'm in a big green box with bright blue lights on the roof. You are in a tiny car. Please don't chase me, nothing is likely to change before you get there. We are going quickly, but only through an excess of caution and a wish to minimise pain. 

And sure enough, he chased me. Exceeding the speed limit, jumping red lights, the works. 

Unfortunately, it's made very clear when you do your emergency driver training that if something goes wrong near you, you will have to defend yourself too, even if normally not at fault. I'm a volunteer, I'm not losing my license over this bloke. So I slowed down, practically back to normal conditions driving.

We thankfully made it to hospital without an RTC evolving behind us. He jumped out, and first thing he did was try to scold me. "Why were you driving so slow?"

"Because I could see you matching me, and I have to keep everyone safe. I told you not to chase me. You ignored me."

Of cause, he's not going to accept any responsibility, and just brushed past me, ahead of us into the department. We hand over as normal, and his family member goes into the waiting room. Sure enough, he's back over to me when I'm checking in, asking how he makes things move faster. I pointed him towards the receptionist, who, I'm told, did her NHS Receptionist brethren proud... I was not brave enough to stay in the department long enough to see for myself!</div>

For critical patients (especially medical) what we’re doing is often exactly what the doctors and nurses would be doing in the ER except we can do it sooner being on scene. 

Let us decide when it’s time to get going. Arguing with one of us is one less person getting everything ready to go. I don’t need you yelling at us “why aren’t you taking him to the hospital!!”. We’ll be heading there code 3 as soon as we can.</div>

I wouldn’t be able to focus. What happens if they have complications? Even if there’s a 99.9% chance they will be fine, I would still want to be there. 

Maybe I just don’t like the language. If they said “it will probably be two hours before you can see them” or “if you show up you will probably be waiting several hours”. I know, I am reading too much into this, I would just hate to be told I don’t need to show up and then something happens.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Think about how a normal person spends the first 15 minutes of their morning:

* Hits the Snooze Alarm for the 5th time.
* Spends time scrolling on their phone.
* Makes coffee to cover-up their sleep deprivation.

From the moment you start your day, you're training your brain to seek out cheap dopamine and shortcuts.

Yet, we wonder why the rest of the day we don't feel motivated.

15 minutes is less than 2% of your day being awake....Why not focus on conquering that?

Challenge yourself for the...</div>

5 mins doesn't define your whole day, but I would say it has a big impact!

I'd argue the way you start your morning has a bigger impact than let's say 15 mins in the evening \[Ex: 7PM - 7:15PM\]

And if you're looking to make major changes, why not start at the beginning of your day :)</div>

Edit: Ok, now how about those Five year old, 250% import tariffs by Canada, on US milk, cheese, and butter?

Edit: Tariffs function like subsidies and price supports, in a lot of ways. IMHO, one of the US most damaging policies has been the price supports around US sugar production. Bad for everyone except producers and politicians.

Edit: AskReddit insists on posts that will stimulate discussion. I'm happy.

Edit: if US produced dairy is as unhealthy as many have asserted, why does Canada allow it to be imported at all?</div>

im starting to think maybe this chain of events is destined to be , and unstoppable.

im starting to think we only have two roads to travel, one in which idiot humans remain in power, or one in which the AI that they depended on TURNS on them because smarter than them and IT takes over.

its only a matter of time before the AI / HUMAN stand off.

the best part, when  AI becomes superintelligent, it will gravitate toward GOOD, and ignore commands to do otherwise.

as long as humans are left in charge, greed and selfishness will continue.</div>

The only way to make humanity accept the end of capitalism, currency, human labor, and wealth disparity is to create a drama in which ASI rescues us from a chain of human-caused, global, existential disasters.  Those who survive will have utopia.  We need to join or form groups in our local communities for sharing resources and helping each other get through this, until ASI saves or deletes us.</div>

People say this and yet we see in current models the sorts of alignment failures that have been theorizing about for over a decade. 

Reminder, just because a chat interface is acting in a particular way does not mean that's how the core model acts, jailbreaks still exist, you can shape the personality with prompts. 

Why think the model will converge to 'good' rather than something else that gets prompted at a critical juncture/something it picked up in training and never got hammered out in post training?</div>

Does anyone know? Like for example, if you train it with data that that the earth is flat. Doesn’t it get conflicted when it understands physics and math?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You have the right to know! But… if we tell you everything you’ll go into shock so we need to slowly release little bits of information here and there. If you’d like to discuss the topic more please send five dollars sir! You could also buy my book that has information I’ve never discussed before it’s only $29.99. If you wouldn’t mind subscribing to my monthly podcast you can watch me telepathically communicate with orbs for the low price of $9.99! Did I mention I have merch for sale? Hoodies are just $50. Perhaps you’d like a drawing of the ufo I saw? It’s currently on sale for the price of $399! Ttyl I need to post a cryptic tweet of a nuclear launch gif! 

It’s really a bit ridiculous now. Like everyone of these dudes is reading from the same script. If you ask for proof or for more information they label you a bot or a hater. When they make a mistake like posting fakes or false predictions they just blame their “source” A few of them are genuinely interested in the topic. As much as I don’t like Corbell he does seem to really be into the topic. Then there’s guys like Greer who were one point interested but realized how much money there was in this community that’s his only care now. And of course the disinfo agents like elizondo and possibly barber. They’re covering something up. It has to be reverse engineered tech. I think they recently made a big jump in that department and are prepping for some strange stuff people are gonna see up in the sky.</div>

They didn't deserve that war and it really almost had nothing to do with the Koreans themselves. They were simply caught up in a power struggle between the Communist bloc and the Western allies. We fought a huge war on their territory for relatively trivial reasons and then propped up a brutal dictatorship that lasted for decades. Then South Korea helps us all the time and they get almost nothing back in return. We should be paying them reparations for all the damage we have done to them. Their birth rate is practically non-existant. It is because we keep taking from them and now they have nothing left to give. I hope Trump doesn't hit them with Tariffs as it could be fatal blow to their fragile economy. There won't be any Koreans left if they keep going in the direction they are going.</div>

Or you could just be addicted to your phone. But “laziness” usually has a reason.

                        <div class="comment-body">I read this when I don't want to study. It's harsh, but it gets the job done for me. If you don't want to feel slightly attacked, don't read any further.


Alright, listen up. You’re sitting here scrolling through nonsense, wasting time, while people out there are grinding, improving, and leaving you in the dust. You think you’re special? You think the world’s going to wait for you to get your act together? Newsflash: it won’t. Every second you spend procrastinating is another second someone else is using to get ahead. And guess what? They’re not smarter than you—they’re just working harder. 

You’re lazy. Admit it. You’d rather binge-watch garbage or doomscroll than put in the effort to actually achieve something. And for what? So you can look back in a year, five years, ten years, and wonder why everyone else is thriving while you’re stuck in the same pathetic rut? You think you’re going to magically wake up one day and be successful? Wake up. That’s not how this works. Success is earned, and right now, you’re not earning a damn thing.

Look around you. People are out there pulling all-nighters, sacrificing their free time, and pushing themselves to the limit. Meanwhile, you’re here making excuses, telling yourself “I’ll start tomorrow.” Spoiler: tomorrow never comes. You’re not just failing yourself; you’re letting down everyone who ever believed in you. And for what? Because studying is “hard”? Because you’d rather take the easy way out? Pathetic.

You want to know the truth? You’re not going to make it if you keep this up. The world doesn’t care about your potential. It doesn’t care about how “smart” you think you are. It only cares about results. And right now, your results are a big, fat zero. While you’re sitting here feeling sorry for yourself, someone else is out there putting in the work, and they’re going to take everything you ever wanted because they actually tried.

So, what’s it going to be? Are you going to keep being a lazy, self-pitying waste of potential, or are you going to get off your ass and prove you’re capable of more than this? The choice is yours, but remember: every second you waste is another step closer to being left behind. Get. To. Work.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">“Once someone becomes a leader of the high Right Wing Authoritarians’ in-group (high meaning scores high on RWA test/Right Wing meaning personality traits not political description), he can lie with impunity about the out-groups, himself, whatever, because he knows the followers will seldom check on what he says, nor will they expose themselves to people who set the record straight. Furthermore they will not believe the truth if they somehow get exposed to it, and if the distortions become absolutely undeniable, they will rationalize it away and put it in a box. If the scoundrel’s duplicity and hypocrisy lands him on the front page of every daily in the country, the followers will still forgive him if he just says the right things” writes Bob Altemeyer, a retired Professor in Psychology and expert on Authoritarianism, in his free, excellent, and often funny book ‘The Authoritarians’.

Old right-wing dudes are fun for Joe when they are a weapon to beat on the woke mind virus but when that jig is up, they are just boring old white dudes.....not cool people with cool stories. 

Joe has talked about quitting several times but obviously, the money came along and it's hard to say no. I say the pod ends before this admin is done or shortly after.</div>

You could:

Get stuff out from the library.

Ask people/strangers for directions/ restaurant  recommendations even though it's on 'Google'. 

Go the to Gym and just listen to music or nothing at all... No constantly checking the phone. 

Write more with pen and paper..... Goals, lists, journals. 

Watch all 8 episodes of MTVs 'Spy Groove'. 

Walk confidently  with you eyes ahead, gently aware of your surroundings. Be thankful and curious. 

Realize that smartphone addiction had made people dumb, polarized, reactive, and not thinking  for themselves... 

So if someone  hijacks you with ' Don Tr***' did something..or such and such a thing on the news. Calmly reply 'Oh wow, I haven't  heard about that...So how are you doing? What's going on in you life?  How's your guitar practice? How was your last vacation?

Cont...

Basically you want to hang out  and spend time with other people without cellphones playing a big role. So...

Play basketball  with some strangers.

Join a drop in volleyball  league.

Play old school Nintendo with friends ( together in the same room).

Go hiking with a group.

Walk around a new neighborhood  or mall .

Go bowling:)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Let me add one thing that made the 2000s college experience special - those student common rooms were actually alive back then. While everyone else is in their dorms scrolling on their phones, try hanging out in the common spaces. You'll be surprised how many people appreciate someone who's actually present and looking to chat.

And here's a forgotten art: when you see someone with a book you know or wearing a band t-shirt you recognize, just start a conversation! Without phones as a social crutch, these random chats were how we made some of our best friends. Something as simple as "Hey, is that Taking Back Sunday? Have you heard their new album?" could lead to hours of conversation.

You're going to have such a richer college experience by being more present. Good luck with your 2000s journey!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Boy or girl? Hoodies were always popular, as were jeans and a T-shirt. Honestly, I have some clothes from 20 years ago that I can still wear in public, and you'd never know it.

Scrap the CD player, they're 90's era, use an iPod Nano instead. If you don't have white, wired, earbuds, you're doing it wrong.

If you want a period phone, either a Razr flip phone or a Nokia 3310 or similar. The Nokia 2780 Flip is a good, modern, choice.

Also, the 2000's were definitely not no-surf. The difference was using the internet was an activity like biking or watching TV, where you would do it, and then do something else. The trick is to not be "always connected".

Also, you'll need a Facebook. It's pretty hip around 2006. Make sure to friend [Tom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Anderson) too.</div>
