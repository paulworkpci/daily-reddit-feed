And total solidarity with your wife tearing up seeing the athletes! 
I ran into Annie T. a few years back after she competed at the Games (she was in Chicago). 
I crossed the street with her and I started stuttering to my husband who had zero clue of who she was lol 

She was with her family so I did not have the guts to stop her. But it was so cool! 

And J am glad to hear that the athletes were approachable!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I don't think people really understand the context he grew up in as a boomer of his age. 

His lawyer during this accusations made the statement that at that time there was no crime for marital rape.

This was mostly true.  Until around 1993 a husband was not required to obtain consent to have sex with his wife. This was not a crime.  

As a guy born in 1946, his most formative years were during the time women had and minorities had no rights.

For a wealthy white guy with money and no conscience he probably thought it was pretty awesome.   

He spent his 20s and 30s watching minorities and women gain rights AND wages. 

He is nostalgic for the time you didn't need to be wealthy as long as you could keep other groups really poor.  

He, and many like him, think treating people fair, is to take away something from him, or treat him unfairly.  

His "grab'em by the pussy" comment though horrendous, represented the truth he came of age in.  You didn't need consent from a women.  Most sadly, the women and wives of his era knew there was no recourse.  If a wife in 1980 went to the police and said "my husband had sex with me against my will" they would not take a report. 

He erroneously believes it was because "he was celebrity".  The reality was most women knew it was always their word against his.  

Even today, within many circles it is still "obey your head of household".  

What is wild, at 50, when most men mature out of their sex pest phase, this guy was running a beauty pageant for teenage girls and employing teenage girls for massages at his golf course.

He was never the cool ladies man he portrays himself as.  Just guy with money  and a knack for spotting vulnerable people.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Excellent comment.

It's still this way to a degree. To this day, I honestly believe if a woman called the police and said, "My husband had sex with me against my will," it wouldn't lead to much of anything in a lot of places, unless you said he involved a gun or something like that.

To this day, a lot of people choose to believe the man over the woman and believe the woman is lying to get money or to hurt the man. Read what people think about, say, Conor McGregor's most recent case where he was found civilly liable of sexual assault in Ireland. 

There are a lot of reasons why women don't often speak out against wealthy men, and a big one is because they won't be believed anyway and now THEIR name will be drug through the mud.

It's absolutely applicable to Donald Trump.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I used to do indoor "cycling" on a stationary bicycle stand at home, during winter times. It's extremely boring to exercise like that on a bike indoors so I would usually search for a continuous POV cycling vid on youtube to help me get into the mood.

Honestly, when this new tech becomes publicly available and accessible in terms of costs I'm gonna be so much looking forward to my indoor cycling again.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Let’s take a moment to acknowledge that this hype is majorly self-made. People overhype OpenAI’s products, then freak out at Sam when it fails to meet their own unrealistic expectations. 

Yes Sam hypes things from time to time, but just recognize how much of this hype is self inflicted and based on OpenAI having consistently produced the highest quality of product in the past. That way when (if) we’re disappointed, we have some humility.</div>

edit: yep first few sentences of the article

i think there’s something to be said about hondas stubbornness to keep the CTR fwd only all these years. yes it’s at the sacrifice of performance and a certain type of fun but it’s a testament to honda on how far they can take a FWD platform. “it’s just a civic” that can also run some damn good lap times but not everyone’s cup of tea and has its drawbacks at the highest level</div>

This may be the understatement of the year. The average casual track enthusiast is almost certainly going to be faster in a CTR than in any RWD or AWD car because the platform isn't just "ok, for a FWD"; it's actually just one of the best enthusiast cars that's come out in the last decade.

Seriously, while I'm sure Verstappen is at the skill level where he might be limited by the platform, assuming he can see the track with his head so far up his own ass. But an average driver? Hah. You're not getting anywhere near the limits where platform dynamics like which wheels are driven start to matter.

Plus, you know, limits are fun. Limits are what create challenge, and without challenge you turn into a rich douche who should give fewer interviews and spend that freed-up time trying to extricate his head from his anus.</div>

If I reflect, considering Meditation as a challenge, a task was not the right way of starting. We should not bring our ego or consider doing meditation with the expectation that we are doing some higher purpose stuff and we will become higher-level souls, more liberated than the rest.</div>

Edit: Someone requested that I include its response. Here ya go:

Okay! Here’s how I’d explain welding to a 5-year-old:

⸻

“Welding is like using a super hot crayon to glue metal things together.” 🔥🧲

You know how glue sticks paper together? Welders use a special tool that’s REALLY hot — so hot it can melt metal! Then they use it to stick big pieces of metal together, like parts of cars, buildings, or robots. 👨‍🏭✨

They wear cool helmets and gloves because it’s super bright and hot, and they want to stay safe.

So a welder is someone who makes metal things strong and stuck together — like a superhero for metal!</div>

Is this relevant? 99% of the population aren't hiring for a full stack dev. They only see the output.

You can't tell the difference between shitty 'conventional' software and shitty vibe coded software in *most* cases, but again, is that relevant?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’d probably want to look at the study and the context. If this is a scan whilst they have been set a task and one person is using ChatGPT and the other isn’t, then I would expect it to look like that. In that case, ChatGPT is doing most of the thinking for you so you don’t have to. 

Taken out of context it can look like using ChatGPT just makes your brain less active overall. I imagine that there were people who thought Google would just make people dumber (maybe it did?). However, it’s probably more complicated than that, and has to do with whether people just stop researching, writing, or creating at all because they are outsourcing it all to AI.

If you’re worried about it, then consider making sure you spend some time doing creative outputs, and try not to rely on ChatGPT for everything. 

That said, there will come a time (may already be here) that a person using ChatGPT and not thinking much will be able to put perform a person not using AI and doing the mental lifting themselves. 🤷🏻‍♂️</div>

I kinda got into a period of over relying on gpt for a good 4 months as a developer and I can guarantee that my attention span, problem solving skill and my ability to clearly formulate a solution reduced and the time taken for doing these tasks significantly increased.

End of the day high level thinking will require you to combine ideas from different fields. Assuming someone has stopped thinking for themselves and completely outsources thinking to gpt, I seriously doubt that person would be able to formulate the right questions to ask gpt assuming gpt could solve it.</div>

I'm seeing similar reports, of the model suggesting or trying to find overengineered solutions when simple solutions exist.

I think OpenAI just open-sourced some kind of failed experimental model, after they gave up on it. 

At least whichever team was working on it, can write "we released open source model" and still pursue that promotion they were aiming for.</div>
