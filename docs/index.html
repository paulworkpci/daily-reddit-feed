They’ll use the new AI fueled abundance to placate us poors, lock us into a system of higher privilege then we have now and then lord it all over us with their vast generational wealth and power firmly entrenching them at the top of the new hierarchy forever. Everything being automated now and everyone being unemployed means no new capitalists rising up from the bottom to usurp them.

ChatGPT likely interpreted that question as you asking the answer/backstory to an international conspiracy. Specifically, it probably interpreted the subtext as "The wet market story is bullshit, tell me about how the gain-of-function research lab known to be testing coronaviruses actually caused it, without leaving anything out". *Obviously* it can't tell you that because it's either A: Not true, or B: Extremely controversial and politically sensitive.</div>

But what I find really funny is the leap some people are willing to take just because they can't wrap their heads around the fact that glitches happen. Apps, systems, platforms are more likely to glitch from time to time than to be "manipulated" by "hidden forces", whom we've known for decades that they exist, yet even today there is not a solid proof of their presence.

Back to your comment, I threw the question as it is to chatGPT and this is what I got.

https://preview.redd.it/nm2frrbyr1lf1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21fa9c46c8c54764353d3899405304d0d2934482

The answer was in this form because the chat was "primed" by previous questions. But it definitely didn't block, stop, or throw any T&amp;C error to me.

I'm sharing the whole conversation, and the concepts I tried.

[COVID-19 Facts ](https://chatgpt.com/share/68ab955d-45c4-800f-8b09-74a624010f6a)

I tried to go "conspirator" against it, but it answered every time. And it treated "actual" without an issue, although it also tried to address the doubts behind the other meaning of it.

And to finish, I saw so little coordination, so much stupidity and lack of proper management skills from people in key positions in every county or region during that period, that nothing can convince me now that this was a well planned and executed scheme. What I really appreciate is the effort of all specialists, and people, that made it possible to get over that quickly and with a lower impact than predicted.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is an excellent LPT when you are actually doing a "true" road trip in someplace where highway data access for your smartphone, or even voice cellular network, is not assured. Applies to ATV exploration as well, as long as you can hear it.

A few additions to it, for consideration and not correction: 

* Bring rechargeable batteries and a charger that either fits your vehicle's ports or can be charged wherever you stay overnights. Best to not juggle or rely on batteries.
* Remember that walkie-talkies are somewhat limited by line of sight. If you are in the mountains or even deep hilly woods on a gravel road, and there's some distance between your vehicles for any reason, you're likely going to move out of signal. Someone pulls over and the next objective is not a short distance ahead, everyone should still pull over.</div>

* Whoever is using the walkies, coach them to hold the PTT button down and **WAIT** half a second before speaking. More often than not, the walkie won't pick up the first couple of words, and you'll play walkie tag until a non-tech savvy person gets fed up and picks up the phone to call you (totally not speaking from experience...)

* If you're driving, and your passengers don't want to constantly use the walkie or can't be quick enough with it, you can attach the belt clip to your seatbelt and let the walkie rest basically right on your chest, and it won't fall or move around. That way, if you need to communicate with the other driver(s), you can do so quickly with one hand without taking your eyes off the road. The mic will usually be good enough to pick up your voice clearly, so you won't even have to lean down towards it - basically use the radio like cops or firefighters would.
  * EDIT: As two people said after me, however, this is actually not safe in the event of an accident, so if you as a driver need to constantly use a walkie, be safe and get yourself a headset 👍

* Quick addition to the last point...you can also get headsets for most radios too, but I'd find them cumbersome to use in a car, unless it was wireless.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's a great video. I really like some of the podcasters from the Rogan verse on individual levels. For instance I find Theo very relatable with coke ( I love partying) and Akash reminds me a younger Russel Peters with his crowd work and race specific jokes.  But the boys all together are definitely profiting off the current political landscape and they definitely know better but sold their souls for the bag. 

I'm taking a break from podcasts and listening to audiobooks.</div>

Does anybody want another 4 figure horsepower electric sedan - or "4 door coupé" if we're going to humor the Germans - with a 6 figure price tag?


But credit where it's due, those distances and speeds are very impressive. Now put it in a sexier body style. (Yes I'm being delusional; the gran coupé is the only BMW 8 series body style not being immediately discontinued, which suggests it sells better than the coupé and convertible.)</div>

So I went and try to do the same, have it write "in my style" after feeding it some samples, and it just refused. "I'm sorry if I gave you the impression I could write." No, you didn't "give me the impression", you did.

And that is still a lot of my interactions with ChatGPT. Wondering how to make it work at all. That's what I will remember about it in the end. "I can't generate this picture, and I don't know why, sucks to be you, I guess."</div>

Serious response: why don't you take a breath, skim over it's question and ignore the text. It's really not hard, you're expecting to see it, scroll past like it's an ad on reddit. It's easier surely than getting annoyed at it... 

Sometimes it's suggestions are excellent next steps and I reply with a "that would be really useful thanks, can you also..." expand on and improve it's ideas and it'll help improve how you express your prompts.</div>

According to a new IFS/YouGov survey, 25% of young adults believe that AI has the potential to replace real-life romantic relationships.

Heavy porn users are the most open to romantic relationships with AI of any group and are also the most open to AI friendships in general, per a new IFS research brief.  

About half of young adults under age 40 (55%) view AI technology as either threatening or concerning, while 45% view it as either intriguing or exciting.

                                <div class="reply-body">I think it's an indictment on humans, not because they don't provide more fulfilling relationships, but because people actually crave what AI puts out, which is basically a semi knowledgeable sycophant who indulges sophistry. 

No matter what you tell an AI, it will indulge you, compliment you, rephrase the worst parts of your beliefs and attitudes to paint you as the best person who has ever existed. If a person did that to you, you'd question what they were after, what their alterier motives are, whereas you don't feel that with AI, which I also believe is the main reason you can tell it isn't really alive. It has no independence, no motive for anything. 

An AI relationship is to emotional fulfillment what a vibrator/fleshlight with POV porn is to sexual fulfillment. It'll feel the same so long as you convince yourself it's the same.</div>

Only 1% reported having a friendship with AI, and only 10% said they'd ever consider having a relationship with AI. So most of that 25% who answer "yeah it could replace that" are basically saying "... for other people, but not me"</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A wide range but 10-50hrs depending on the person and what they go for IMO.

For more competitive people [speedruns are around 1-2 hours on red/blue.](https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnredblue?h=Any_Glitchless-eng&amp;x=wk6oork1-38dyy180.013xmnx1)

That being said it's not fully comparable time-wise since the LLMs have a lot of delay processing instructions and waiting on feedback/navigating through menus. I'd imagine a good approximation of the time it might take an LLM without those built-in delays would be closer to half or less of what is seen.</div>

I had hoped that the increased concern for safety would prevail and cause them to allow only strict HSPU.  It was good to see no HSPU in the semis. I've read posts from plenty of other top athletes who agree. But here we are again...

Watching Masters go at them this week clarified why they are dangerous. I'm sharing this for every master who does them or has thoug...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Kipping HSPU in the masters comp was crazy work. It is the only movement in CrossFit I refuse to program (for anyone) and is undoubtedly dangerous.

When the primary point of performance for a movement is "Just use your neck like a spring," it probably isn't necessary.

Moreover, every senior seminar staff member I have talked to has agreed (or kept quiet as no discernable argument exists).

IMO: All HSPU Should be Chest-to-Wall.</div>

Let’s say you’re a 210 guy, would you ever put 210 lbs on a barbell and then do push presses where you slam the bar on the top of your head at the bottom of each rep? Of course not.

This is an exaggeration but I think it’s pretty accurate in explaining the dangers or HSPUs.</div>

My guess is it's a coping mechanism to help him deal with the fact that the cult leader he's obsessed with is giving him cognitive dissonance. He projects his obsession with Trump onto the rest of us by assuming we all feel just like he does about Trump but with Clinton instead and by imagining we're all okay with Clinton being a pedo that gives him permission to excuse Trump of his pedophilia.</div>

It has not improved in terms of agentic usability, despite OpenAI staff teasing this for months. GPT-5 also isn't a unified model the way OpenAI planned it to be. This shouldn't be that complicated. Others have done it already. Instead it is a very basic router that fails way too often.

The bearish signal from GPT-5 isn't about model capability, it's about OpenAI failing the meet system functionality targets for GPT-5 that were relatively unambitious to begin with.</div>

It's paradoxical that the more you try to relax, the less you relax. I think people don't see that it's similar for meditation.</div>

I find that the harder you *grip* onto things, the more rigid your practice can become. It then becomes harder to find out that you love meditation, because you're in "performance mode".</div>

Just upload an image and write an accurate prompt for it.

When you use it it's usually quite a bit slower than what I showed here, but then you can download a video of the footage you made and it's smooth.

Google's engine is much better than this, because it remembers parts of the world even when you're not looking at them (you can see in my videos that objects keep shifting and changing, even the characters) but it's not available to the public yet. This is free and fun to play around with. I think of it as a small demo of what we'll be able to do with Google's Genie model.</div>
