 DON’T DO THIS.

* It wastes time and money and
* It makes the AI **dumber.**

In fact, the graph above is what lazy prompting does to your AI.

It's a graph (from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01798)) of how GPT 3.5 performed on a test of common sense after an initial prompt and then after one or two lazy prompts (“recheck your work for errors.”)...</div>

Step 1 can be automatically included in tools.
Step 2, you can ask the LLM to rephrase/expand it. Example: ”implement auth”

3: the LLM + text selection should be able to generate a phrase.

4 and 5: ask LLM to generate an analysis 

6: ask LLM/+tool to include files</div>

The rules are simple:

Fixed amount goes in monthly (whatever you can afford)

Once it's in there you can spend it on literally anything without guilt

When it's gone it's gone until next month

Never dip into other accounts for impulse stuff

It's been amazing for my relationship with money....</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think there are a lot of things like this. Different people need different amounts of friction to accomplish the same goals. Some people can just choose not to overuse whatever apps they want to reduce usage of. Others need Digital Wellbeing to kick them out, but that's enough. Others, like one guy I saw, need to use Tasker to create an unignorable kicking-out after the deadline they set for themselves. Perhaps others, even that might be insufficient, and they should just get a dumb phone.

For me, this advice is unnecessary. For others, it's insufficient. For OP, sounds like it works. That's not unusual, though -- [that's just how advice works](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/09/all-debates-are-bravery-debates/).</div>

I remember the expose's about shut ins who became addicted to being online. They forgot their job, family, everything, all to be on the /new/ internet all day. These people were shown as examples of the dangers of this new thing called "the internet". I think AI and LLMs are going through it now. Edge-case users are using the new tool in unhealthy ways now. Society gets scared because we fear the unknown future ahead. I think in time we will find a place for AI in our world. Things will normalize and level out. Some bad aspects will emerge. Some good will, too. Just buckle up and get ready.</div>

There's all lowercase sama, the marketing department hype man who speaks unintelligently and overpromises, trying to resonate with a certain demographic on Twitter.

Then there's the real Sam, the one who types like an adult and speaks his mind unfiltered. 

I find the lowercase grating, but at least he uses syntax clues to easily identify which tweets aren't worth reading.</div>

Even if classical computing will never produce digital consciousness, billions worldwide will perceive sentience in their lifelike virtual loved ones. All judgments aside, this is a pretty substantial sociopolitical phenomenon.

Even with all that, neuromorphic computing and biocomputing will reach animal-scale in my lifetime.
So what Sam describes above is the prelude to a new societal challenge that will last decades.</div>

It keeps getting reduced to “Some people want a cuddly emotional support AI, but real users use GPT-5 because it’s better for coding, smarter etc and everyone else just needs to get over it.” And that’s it. That’s the whole take.

But this framing is WAY too simplistic and it completely misses the deeper issue which to me is actually a **systems-level question about the kind of AI f...</div>

This seems bad to me. You’re probably right that it will continue along this trajectory, but the level of distress over losing access to this particular chatbot seems worrying. These things are constantly evolving. There’s a hundred different options that might fit your needs. 4o itself still exists for the cost of Netflix. If it’s just about the most practical model, this seems at most like a frustrating but temporary setback.</div>

I think it is literally that it’s “friendly.” No it doesn’t get you, but it is giving you something society isn’t: active listening. 

This is a uniquely more modern thing. The selfishness in modern society is just incalculable right now. I truly think we need a government program yesterday that pays extroverts to simply talk and be friends with people. I’m genuinely serious. I think it’s that bad. 

GPT 4o was no bueno, but this problem needs to be addressed. 4o isn’t the source. Wasn’t the source. People would prefer real humans to fill this role. There’s just no humans willing to mentor or invest in anyone anymore. It’s pretty rare. Very sad. I’m 29, I remember a brief period before iPhones where people talked to each other.

1. Coding a garbage. When I want to make proof of concept, calculate something very complicated or make temporary projects (eg. I need a specific browser extension, but only to do one thing). For that purpose I mainly use CLI agentic tools

2. Autocomplete. When agentic coding gets all the hype, this is such an underrated feature. For me it cuts coding time at least in half.

                        <div class="comment-body">Wow! So many people think they're "doing it wrong" and give up simply because they have thoughts. But you've organically figured out how to stay present with them, not get carried off by any given train of thought, and instead investigate/process them without identifying with them too much. I'll bet your previous on-and-off efforts laid the groundwork for what seems (to me at least) like kind of an advanced Buddhist move. Definitely worth the effort!</div>

Which is definitely scary because those folks seem like they could be easily influenced by subtle system prompt tweaks. No AGI needed…

The era of AI being a super-persuader has definitely arrived much earlier than anticipated. Just how long will it be before an influential politician or something falls for this and becomes fully beholden to a private corporation, lest they “kill” their “loved one?”</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yup. All of the "essential work" turns out to be the least compensated/respected by society. Literally the jobs that, without which, society would collapse. Meanwhile, middle-managers held zoom meeting after zoom meeting to discuss the next zoom meeting while still collecting their full paychecks while "working" from home. It's depressing dude. The jobs that actually make our lives livable are treated so poorly while some fucking nuisance streamer can make millions being a total piece of human garbage. Our society incentivizes all of the wrong behaviour.</div>

For one project Claude Code with Sonnet 4 was better. For the other one Cursor with GPT-5 did better.

So I guess they are similar in performance for web development. Exactly which one is better depends on the project and the task.

Sonnet is more reserved in that regard, and better for maintainability in full stack.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's actually very interesting. This is the first model that seems to be very close. It does things differently in a way that makes things interesting. There is a particular bug in a test suite that I asked Sonnet to fix and it didn't get it. Then I half-heartedly gave Gpt 5 a prompt and it actually solved it. And it ignored some of my wrong information in the prompts, which was very interesting. So I actually got an OpenAI plus plan for the first time to try it out with Codex CLI.

What I'm sad about is how bad Gemini is, even though it's a good model, it simply has not been properly productized. Google really needs to hire some proper product managers.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">He says that because “empathic” models are not yet viable economically for them, short answers are cheaper.

Its all about the economics, he wouldn’t care if people would be in love with their AI if they could profit big off of it, they would simply spin it the other way around, that people are lonely and need someone to listen and they offer the solution to that. 

OpenAI doesn’t really have a track record of caring about people or people’s privacy so this is just cheap talk.

Edit: People freaked out but I’m being realistic. The core reason any company exists is to make profit, that’s literally its purpose. Everything else like green policies, user well-being or ethical AI is framed in ways that align with that goal. 

That’s why policies and regulation should come from the government, not from companies themselves because they will never consistently choose people over profit. It’s simply against their core business nature.</div>

I can hand 5o a website with abcd, then ask it to identify if abcd is there and to compile all the info on abcd from the website and it will spit out 5dt4gh. It will do the same for word docs. I had to wipe all my rules, clear cache, then re-load a heavier set of rules that force it to self check then re-innitiate. Suddenly 5o is taking 20-40 seconds for simple tasks, but it's finally accurate. Going under the hood it's realizing it's wrong through the self check and running the same problem 3-5 times before getting it correct. No way the gas fees for repeated use are lower than 4o with a labotomy.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Boy, the article buries the lede rather aggressively - the real story is in the bottom half.

They got Tesla's vp of production and are shipping the 'unboxed' EV format that Tesla announced but never shipped due to getting distracted up on the cybertruck/cab.

The base idea is that, instead of putting together the unibody of the car and then installing the parts on it, they will be building the car in three large parts and putting it together at the end of the line. This allows parallel production and makes it much easier to build an interior as you are not limited to working on it through the doors.

Presumably, the dash will be the back of the front sub-assembly, the seats are mounted to the battery and the roof and doors are part of the rear assembly.</div>
