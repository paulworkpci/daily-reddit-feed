It even answered a question about a medication; I was noticing side effects from it that weren't listed anywhere online. I called the local 24/7 healthline, since my pharmacy was closed. When I called in the past with medication questions, the nurses I would speak to would answer my questions. They don't do that anymore; they say "that's out of my scope of practice" and tell you to contact your pharmacy, even after you tell them that the pharmacy is closed! I found out they're paid $42.00 per call, just to say that. To me, that's a waste of money. The last time this happened, I had a rude nurse so I was rude back: she mocked me for my question (it was about a medication causing rare side effects, which I was experiencing) and snarled to contact my pharmacy. I pointed out that my pharmacy was closed (no pharmacy was open then, it was after hours). I then said that this is just another example of why asking ChatGPT would have been better, since at least it doesn't rudely dismiss me like she was! She then swore and hung up.</div>

Most therapists do sliding scales based on your income if that’s something you’re interested in. Ultimately, they want as many people to have access to therapy as possible so that’s why they do it.</div>

I would regularly be lucky to walk away with one useful sentence from my therapists. Whereas almost every single response from 4o is incredibly insightful. I'm aware that you have to set the standard for honest and unbiased interaction. But the performance was not even comparable. I get more in one session with 4o than an entire year with a traditional therapist

Not to mention that I can talk whenever I need to, not having to bottle things up and wait a appointment. With 4o being superior in almost every metric, and unlimited access anytime that you like. Personally, I don't think I will ever see a human therapist again</div>

Unemployment definitely added to that count, but it also helped keep mental health balanced while i was job hunting.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There are many methods. Stick with just one to avoid confusion. Even in this thread you may find confusion due to different methods. Many use focus. I don't, I much prefer relaxation which is the opposite of focus in that it is effortless without striving. Relaxation when very complete takes the mind to stillness. However, most people need to read about the details to be able to experience this simple easy thing called relaxation. For that chapters in a book. The book I suggest, Ainslie Meares on Meditation.</div>

There are many good teachers from different traditions out there. Podcasts are also a good ressource. Insight Meditation Society has some good podcasts, also with instructions. The teachers I have mentioned you can also find in various podcasts and probably on yt as well.

In the Boston days he would post up in a dark alley and play his part in an organ trafficking ring, how do you think he got that name?

If you couldn't avoid the dark underworld, your second best bet was to just keep walking and mind your own business.

And don't underestimate the potential of more efficiency and performance in addition to scaling up. For example, of somehow everyone started manufacturing wafer scale accelerators like Cerebras, then most LLM inference would get a 5-15+ times boost in performance, making current models almost instantaneous.</div>

When someone like Hasabis, who is not as bullish as Amodei, says AGI is 5 to 10 years away, he is talking about a technology that is actually hard to consider how it would affect our modern life as it is today and if it were around today. But it's possible to see from his comments comments that AGI is neither required for major changes (like the ones that AGI would surely bring about) nor will AGI appear in a world like ours. It would appear in5 to 10 years but it wouldn't transform our world into a new, it would transform the world 5 years from now into a new. And that world 5 years from now will already be different due to the AI progress required for reaching AGI.

The change will be fast but it won't be instant,  and it won't happen 5 years from now. It will start where we are, gradually but quickly changing a significantly before AGI, at which point it would change even further and faster.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I trust Demis more than Dario because Demis and his engineers are leading experts on more AI types than just LLM. Dario says scaling is all. He doesn’t have any expertise or resources on other AIs. Of course he would say that, because if it turns out more breakthroughs are needed, Anthropic is a dead-end project. Unlikely to ever reach profitability.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Anthropic punches way above its weight. Did you miss the news that Opus 4.5 is on par with Gemini, better in some ways but worse in others. In any case from my POV Anthropic is lot more impressive than OpenAI. Claude Code was the first agenti SWE tool that actually impressed me. They are laser focused on SWE and it shows. 


I do generally agree with the rest of your comment though. </div>

Examples:

1. A comfier pillow if they’re always tired at home or office.

He started big kid life as a mechanical engineer, then built his own firm big enough for him to buy his F1 new. 

He's done all of the work on it himself, no matter how long it takes. He only uses the factory tool set, because it's technically all that is needed to service the car. Who is he to question the wisdom of people smarter than himself? He says it's been a very instructive learning experience for him.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Given the cost of this F1, I wonder what some of the more rare versions would bring at auction.

So lets play a little game. I will name off 4 models and lets see what you think they would sell for.

**Car 1**

Mclaren F1 LM

1 of 5 cars ever made. A 6th car does exist. LM XP1. It is a prototype car that is still owned by McLaren. But for this lets make it one of the original 5. 
LM2, LM3, and LM5 are in Papaya Orange / Historic Orange. 
LM1 and LM4 are Black with silver, blue and yellow graphics. These two cars are owned by the Sultan of Brunei. There are very few pictures of these cars that even exist. 

**Car 2**

Mclaren F1 GT

2 customer cars were built with a 3rd porotype XP car being kept by McLaren. I remember seeing one car at some point being changed to a silver / black two toned color. But who knows where these cars are at now. This is the rarest of the rare.

**Car 3**

1995 Mclaren F1 GTR 

No 59 Ueno Clinic car, chassis 01R.
This car won the 24 hours of Le Mans 

**Car 4**

1998 Mclaren F1 chassis 075

This is the last production F1 ever made. Color is Mansour Orange.</div>

AI being good at computer jobs is one thing, but AI being able to climb into any existing machinery designed by humans, and operate them at 100% efficiency, nearly 24 hours a day...    
  
Oh, and the machine costs $24k, with a $200 monthly subscription.   


We need this to happen for UBI.   Just replacing white collar jobs wont increase the economy, but an army of blue collar workers that are much cheaper than even minimum wage, changes the world.</div>

Dude is an absolute menace to society. It's because of him practically every single person in the U.S. had their SS number leaked, which will no doubt have massive long term economic impacts. How many government systems did he break and how many people got randomly fired? The dude who did a Nazi salute on live television. 

I mean seriously, why is anyone on this subreddit or on reddit in general still singing his praises?

After all the damage done to the country, you're STILL talking about his products with a purchase in mind. It's absolutely bonkers and makes no sense. At this point I'm assuming he could come over to your house and push your granny down the stairs while looking you in the eyes and you'd still kiss his feet.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Good tips! Just wanted to correct a point: Pulling the toes up doesn't tighten the hamstrings (since the hamstring doesn't cross at the foot/ankle), it tightens the sciatic nerve. For anyone interested in mobility/flexibility: If you do feel a bigger stretch in your hamstrings when pulling the toes up (for example in a seated forward fold), you might want to look into nerve glides to improve mobility: [https://www.daniwinksflexibility.com/bendy-blog/how-to-sciatic-nerve-glide-for-happier-hamstrings](https://www.daniwinksflexibility.com/bendy-blog/how-to-sciatic-nerve-glide-for-happier-hamstrings)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes. It indirectly causes tightness in the hamstrings secondarily to the gastrocnemius. Because the gastroc passes the knee joint, pulling the foot into dorsiflexion pulls the knee into flexion which results in people “feeling” tighter in the hamstring without actually lengthening any of the hamstring muscles.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Pets rely heavily on scent memory, especially when they are panicked or disoriented. They will follow a familiar scent trail back to a safe, recognizable spot. Placing their favorite bedding, a litter box (for cats), or a worn shirt outside gives them a strong olfactory "beacon" to home. This is often more effective than frantically calling their name.</div>
