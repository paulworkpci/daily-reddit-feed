I find it to be a great assistant for certain tasks where I lack experience or knowledge, but I still find myself resorting to Google search for double-check or more information.

And on the topics where I know something to some degree, it doesn't really help. I agree on the video/audio part.</div>

Boston Dynamics still doesn't have a firm plan to scale Atlas. It's a cool R&amp;D platform, but people need to stop comparing it to actual products that will come out/are already out.

Optimus' main competitors will come from Chinese companies like Unitree, and maybe Figure (it's still hard for me to tell exactly what's going on with Figure).</div>

"One thing that we should be clear about is that the way the models work is different from how a human brain works. A pre-trained model has learned some things about the world, but it doesn’t really have any conception of how it learned them, or any temporal order as to when it learned things.

I definitely believe we have significant evidence that the models are capable of discovering nove...</div>

I imagine that could be extended to finding connections and patterns in existing scientific papers. That’s very useful and vital feature but it needs to be paired with experimentation. We need to create AI labs specifically designed to let AI experiment and self teach.</div>

If you tell them a new idea you get hallucinations. They (of course) can't differentiate hallucination and novelty. I'd be surprised if this is fixable in the near future.

Even if we get ASI tomorrow, and it’s curing disease or making scientific breakthroughs, people will still be hitting each other over the head over if we even have AGI or not for at least several years after it’s here.

I don’t think the concession from society that we have AGI will happen overnight, it’ll be a gradual process after it gets here.

If I had to guess, it’ll be a 2-5 year ‘capitulation phase’ post AGI/ASI. Might be on the shorter end if it’s a hard takeoff and it can crack Eric Drexler’s Nanotechnology. It’s gonna be hard for them to claim it’s not general intelligence when it’s literally reshaping the atomic and molecular composition of matter.</div>

It will be able to find solutions to any problems faster than us and that solution will have greater effect. These are my speculations on ASI and what it can do.

It will Interact with everyone and help them reach a new height of their potential even overnight. Sometimes you read a quote or hear something someone said, and suddenly this makes a *click* in your brain and everything is unraveled right before your eyes. I believe it will be able to do that for everyone, personalized.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">First off, disable agent mode. You need to work in tiny pieces.  You can start by creating AI specific readmes and comments to help the LLM.  Document patterns and key calls in readmes per project. Llms can help you write these as you explore the code base.  It’s going to be a lot of work.

Also get really good at tight commits and wrangling the LLM.  If you don’t maintain complete control, it will eat your code.  Pay very close attention to all the diffs to make sure it’s not changing shit Willy nilly. You need to learn the code well to keep the LLM in check.

Focus a lot on your prompts as much as you do leaning the code.

Happy vibe engineering! :)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">For code understanding, you can use a cheaper model for most of the files.  You only need a smart model (like Sonnet or Gemini Pro) for complex algorithms.  I prefer Gemini Flash 2.5 as it's fast, cheap, smart, and has a large context.

---

I've summarized codebases with a recurive shell script that make use of openai's CLI (but configured to use Gemini Flash).  Pseudo code:

```
summarize()
  create empty `summaries.md` file.
  for each file:
    if file contains complex algorithms, temporarily switch to a smarter model.
    append a short summary of the file to `summaries.md`
  for each sub-directory:
    { `cd "$directory"`; call `summarize`; }
    append `${directory}/summary.md` to `./summaries.md`
  Generate `summary.md` as a short summary of `./summaries.md`
  delete `summaries.md`
```

This leaves a `summary.md` file in each directory.

( I determine if a file is complex by counting the number of `if for while` statements, and so requires a smarter model to summarize. )

If I want to understand how a specific user action works, I run the app with code coverage enabled but off, browse to the page and form, turn on coverage, click submit, turn off coverage, and gracefully shut down the app.  Then I paste the coverage report and app logs into a prompt, consisting only of files used and converted to markdown, and ask what happened when I submitted the form.</div>

How a “professional” working at EPA that can speak for them.  is allowed to keep their job. After tweets like this, is beyond me.

It’s not a participation trophy, it’s a legitimate method to reduce pollution, consumption, and help meet MPG goals. Sure some folks don’t like it, myself included. But there is merit to it, especially hybrids that make the transition seem less (the well executed ones at least)

OEM where given emissions goals, so this was a method to achieve it. They literally did what was needed to meet goals</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I love the way our odyssey implements it. It only engages at 50-75%+ brake pressure, so you can easily come to a stop and not use it if you know you’re about to continue again. But at longer lights, it’s almost intuitive to push the pedal down more and trigger the start/stop. Every car should be built like this.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's definitely situational by vehicle and its age. The start/stop on my car wasn't a big deal when it was new. As it aged, it would occasionally be more harsh upon restarting, especially if it happened right as you came to a stop.

That's a car with about 170K miles though--it's not surprising things are less pristine, but something that was irrelevant became a nuisance. Now, I put my car into neutral as I come to a stop because that's the only way to stop the car from shutting off (my car doesn't have a button to shut it off). Other cars I've been in, it's mostly smooth, but none of them have near the miles of mine, and all of those cars cost 2-5 times what I paid for mine.

IDK what the claimed fuel savings would be for my car. The age/wear on my car definitely seems to have a much bigger effect on fuel economy than they'd ever claim. If we're adding complexity to the car for 1-2 MPG, I'd definitely say it's a waste of time.</div>

\- They are using Mixtral (which is not even close to SOTA at this point).

\- There are tools created by Khan Academy that actually help teachers by using AI to provide students feedback on their essay and tracks whether students are copy/pasting from other apps (doesn't guarantee there won't be cheating but at least a start).

I would recommend people interested in AI in Education check out Ethan Mollick's work.</div>

I've seen ChatGPT-driven grading algorithms get implemented for short-answer type questions that otherwise go completely ungraded 95% of the time, because each teacher has like 5 fucking classes, and the homework has 10 short answer questions, and each class has 30 kids, so you're talking about thousands and thousands of short answer questions per week, or maybe even per day depending on the frequency of the homework in the curriculum.

"But it might hallucinate" -- yeah, and so might the fucking overworked 35 year old woman who has 2 hours to try to grade 1,500 answers on a Thursday night after putting her own kids to bed and drinking another cup of coffee to try to keep her sleep deprived ass awake.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;One professor in Ithaca, NY, [shares both](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/06/tech/teachers-grading-ai/index.html) ChatGPT's comments on student essays as well as her own, and asks her students to run their essays through AI on their own.

I've done this in peer reviews on scientific papers. Not the whole paper, but just enough parts to show people how useful it is. Most people would be shocked how much garbage gets submitted to journals by grad students who have been poorly mentored, and normalizing correct AI use could solve that problem.

The most recent paper I reviewed somehow had failed to report in their results the main quantity they were measuring, statistical test results were described in inconsistent ways but always without the standard details, and they did no checking of assumptions of statistical tests (while using them in ways that probably grossly violated the assumptions). A student's advisor ought to catch "science 101" things like this before submitting a paper, but they frequently fail. People should get in the habit of using AI as a reviewer, so they can learn to avoid remedial mistakes before they waste the time of colleagues in peer review.

If this works for peer review, I see no reason why it shouldn't be used as a similar instructive tool for all forms of writing. People can greatly improve their own work just by having AI explain their mistakes. They key is to teach them how to use it for feedback rather than doing their work for them.</div>

What actually happened was more subtle.

I used to lead dangerous capability testing at OpenAI.

So when ChatGPT started acting strange a week or two ago, I naturally wanted to see for myself what's going on. 

The results of my tests are *extremely* weird. If you don't want to be spoiled, I recommend going to the [article](https://open.substack.com/pub/stevenadler/p/is-chatgpt-actually-fixed-now?r=4qacg&amp;utm...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I sort of touched on this during the Age of Glaze, but similar to what you're saying, if we are struggling to understand and balance the models as they are now then what are we going to do when they're much more powerful? OpenAI doesn't seem to understand what makes or breaks the model. "Unintended effects" are all well and good when you supposedly want your bot to be more agreeable and helpful and it ends up being a "sycophant", but what about when you integrate it into vital systems and have "unintended effects" there? 


The race for AI is eerily similar to creating atomic weapons and classically human. Sprinting through a forest with blindfolds on just so we can beat everyone else to the other side. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think you're exactly right in summarizing the issues here. Sycophancy is pretty easy-to-define and easy-to-spot as far as AI misbehavior goes. If we can't actually stop it, we might be in a lot of trouble when it comes to stopping more complicated (and more concerning) behaviors.

I'm not sure I fully agree with the race characterization, though. I do think there are real benefits of 'winning' a race to AGI, if it can be won safely. I'm just not confident this will happen at the levels of (non)caution folks are using today.</div>

I remember a lot of people saying : "Yeah but \*something something\*, I'm sure a glass of wine still has some benefits, it's just \*some\* studies, there's been other studies that said the opposite, I'll still drink moderately." And then, almost nothing happened and we carried on.

                        <div class="comment-body">The thing is, people didn’t drink alcohol for the health benefits. People drank it in spite of the known health risks.

Same thing with the hypothetical example of having pets increase mortality rate - people will decide for themselves if it’s worth the trade off.

ASI would increase the amount of information we have to make our own informed decisions. 

But I’ll be very clear - I wouldn’t just expect superintelligence to announce “milk is the leading cause of cancer, don’t drink it.” I expect an “milk is bad for you, here’s 700 other drink options I formulated that taste even better than milk and have only positive health benefits.”

And sure, maybe it says “capitalism and democracy suck.” But it doesn’t say “go figure out something better”. It says “here’s a new system I have been testing with 100,000 hours of simulated existence and it has lead to massively increased positive outcomes. These are the changes I would suggest, starting with…”

If it can demonstrate and support its findings in a  scientifically robust manner, there is no reason not to trust it, especially if it can propose rigorous, testable alternative solutions.</div>

I think this is missing the point that OP is trying to make. When rigorous science came out warning about the health risks of alcohol, a lot of people simply refused to accept that, because they didn't like it. More people accept it now, of course, but the point stands: When ASI (or anyone, really) gives us a warning we don't like, the response won't be fully rational. Even if it perfectly demonstrated its findings in a scientifically robust manner and there was no reason not to trust it and it proposed good alternatives... there will still be significant irrational pushback, because that's just what humans are like. So... what then?</div>

For example, it could widely disseminate that a fact is already understood and accepted by people in/near someone's "tribe"/circle, even if that isn't yet true, by subtly manipulating what someone sees about the subject (or adding "examples"). It could break through echo chambers much more easily than "outsiders".</div>

OP's example of "milk causes cancer" would hardly be troubling because nobody out there stakes their identity and belief system on milk being healthy. But what happens if superintelligence comes to the conclusion that a certain gender is better fit for politics, or that a particular ethnic group causes more harm than good to society on the aggregate. What happens if ASI invents a """""cure""""" for being gay, deaf, autistic or left handed? 

These are the sort of interesting revelations that could shake society to its core 🍿</div>

But for those that have a bit more sense it would probably be freeing to have a bit more understanding of what religion should and shouldn’t try to answer. There’s plenty of cultural and philosophical aspects of religion I imagine ASI would see value in.</div>

And I use 4o in chatGPT client for a more conversational type of help, like architecture and stuff. But that is disappointing too. 

I need to guide it to correct architecture, because on it's own it just goes very convoluted path.

e.g. I'm working with unity key value database, it has no real transactions so keeping stuff correct when dealing with multiple keys can be complicated.

So when designing the system and asking me how to deal with that, it gives complex stuff on rollbacks and state management, and I need to be the one to say "what about we go a step back, I think we can put this data onto our player object. This way there's no different keys we modify at the same time and we don't need to do all the complex stuff. And this data is related so I think it should be better for it to live on one key" and only then it can go into that, give pros and cons and help me model the data.

But I must be the one to actually give a suggestion for that in the first place, because if I don't it won't consider it.</div>
