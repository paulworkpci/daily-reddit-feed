That's one of the reasons corpses in open caskets look nothing like when they were alive.  Their muscles are slack for the first time</div>

Every turn has a checkbox beside it and as you approach the window size the older turns deselect so that the newer turns are included instead. 

Then if you need to manage context to keep certain things in you can just anchor them so they never deselect unless you manually remove them. 

It's not ready for deployment yet but I think it's a pretty slick approach.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey this is kind of awesome to watch. Very insightful. It’s interesting that given playwright and Claude desktop alone could achieve with system prompting and telegram. 

This is cool and it feels like I’ve witnessed another step to AGI. 

Curious if you can program the mcp to automatically query the chatbot via telegram trigger. You know the vice versa</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">yes, it will require some infra setup for Claude.
the chatbot will trigger lambda function with Claude Code  and Claude will do something, like writing code.

but it won’t be exactly the same process since we are not interested in testing Claude 😊</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yup there was 1000+ people in the FBI working on this one thing how can they possibly say there is nothing to release.

I agree the goal was to wipe it clean of any trace of Trump and that task proved impossible despite that much manpower and resources going into "preparing them for release".

I have a feeling they will eventually serve up whatever embsrresing, cherry picked documents they ended up with as a result. After seeing the prison video analysis, this half-baked work product couldn't possibly look worse than that.

The binders the WH passed out to their favorite Rumble influencers that contained exactly zero useful information according to those very same sycophantic mouthpieces that had been hand picked for the photo op outside the West Wing....those were put together in a hurry to try and put the subject to bed early in this term.

Didn't quite work out that way lol.</div>

If you're going to pay for the network (or based on the prices, expense it) go to WiFi, then the network (the one you've connected to), then Privacy, then "Use device MAC".

It's me.  I'm the target demo.

I'm in my mid-30s.  I commute 50ish miles round trip to work, mostly on highways.  I need a backseat on occasion for kids, but mostly they ride in the other car (CX-5).  I have a manual fun car for manual fun car things and my wife has no interest in learning stick shift, so both dailies are auto.

I would probably cross shop this with a Prius or Corolla hybrid.  I think it looks better than either of those.  The next car I buy would be one that I hold onto for awhile, with the intent of making it available to my oldest when he's ready to drive.  I would rather it be safe, reliable, and not-too-hot.  It has to be easier to park than my S60 Inscription (long wheelbase makes that car turn like a yacht).</div>

Played the first game and was weirded out initially and thought I wouldn't be able to do it, but I managed to complete all the levels in 10 min.

This benchmark is definitely getting closer to what it means to have human-level intelligence. I fully agree with Chollet when he says a model is AGI if we can no longer find tests where humans outperform it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Arc Agi tests have been moreso testing visual processing than overall general intelligence. The reason why arc Agi is much easier for humans is because our visual processing systems are just so much more advanced compared to any other cognitive function.


Try replaying that game again, but instead of looking at the screen, you only had color coordinates and you weren't allowed to picture the images that the coordinates make up in your head. (You can use notes to make up for memory gaps, but you can't draw or imagine the image). That's what current AI's systems have to do, and it obviously is exponentially more difficult to do so because you have to rely on purely semantical reasoning to infer what's going on with these coordinates.


Right now, Multimodal AI's visual transformers have some basic object recognition abilities, but it's not nearly as insane as humans visual pattern recognition ability. 


Instead of giving SOTA AI the pixel coordinates, if you just semantically described to them in detail about what the game looks like, I guarantee they would do better in figuring out the game plan/strategy


tl;dr ATP arc Agi isn't mainly testing Exploration, Percept Plan Action, Memory, Goal Acquisition, or Alignment anymore. It's mainly just testing visual processing.</div>

A blind person would have trouble completing these too, but we wouldn’t say they’re not intelligent.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think it’s reasonable to test on, though, if the goal is to create a system that can do anything the median human being could do in a given role. If the majority of people can complete these tasks, it’s an indication that something is still missing in the quest for AGI. Once we run out of things that an average person can do but the system can’t, it would be hard to say we don’t have AGI.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Most people approach meditation like they're trying to fix something wrong with their brain. They sit down expecting instant peace, and when their mind keeps racing, they think they're doing it wrong.

The real breakthrough comes when you stop trying to control your thoughts and start observing them instead. When you notice your mind wandering and gently bring it back without judgment. That moment of noticing - that's the meditation. That's where the training happens.

But meditation isn't just ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Perfectionism can be bad. Through the familiarity with the moment the person can feel emotions which feel balancing and uplifting as consciousness entrains emotional experiences. Confidence isn't just some substance which you exude, it's like literally a label we use to describe complex emotional mixed with mental associations. Feeling balanced can come from very very deep places and if someone looks in there long enough they can start to see just how much so the mind can imagine emotional states, and it's a very big difference. Entraining emotions does make an experience more of what it is, that sense of feeling attached to it can be layered and coated, like a hyper-collection of compartmentalized packets of information.

Fickle is a funny word, one can feel like they're entraining that fickle information, forming some connection with it, as if in the next moment they could feel as if they've found something with absolute truth and absolute certainty, when in reality we can't know anything in it's absolute entirety with complete certainty. There are a lot of definitions for the word knowing. So many emotional experiences can start to blend as the sensations emotions become more concentrated and people have clarity and have a sense of executive control/function, like the same mind but it's pre-loaded with compartmentalized goodness.</div>

I really hope the upcoming EO leads to a new surge of open weight models and will push Google and OpenAi and others to open weight even their SOTAs. Release it as pre-lobotomised research preview on hugging face and be “ups we forgot to brain damage it. Too bad it is already out in the wild hosted by some frenchies.”</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Back under Reagan, when they were doing such stuff (Reagan's VP, Bush Sr, saying "atheists can't be good citizens" and demonizing of non christians by republicans/conservatives), they were at least trying to keep these things in the economic sector. Likewise with Bush Jr (dare to criticize the war in Iraq in 2005...).

Now that the republican party stands for MAGA, aka a cult of personality movement, coherence has flown out the window.

It's truly Eco's Ur-Fascism theory, in which any semblance of truth or coherent belief is subsumed under "loyalty".

Between coherent rational thinking and proving your loyalty to your leader, the choice is easy for cult followers. Think that republicans were reduced to try to rationalize Musk and Bannon doing nazi salutes, they'll be able to attempt the same over this.

Cognitive dissonance is strong in conservatives.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is just after Anthropic, Google, OpenAI and xAI were each [granted up to $200M by the DoD](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/14/anthropic-google-openai-xai-granted-up-to-200-million-from-dod.html). It's simple strategy: first get them hooked on federal money, then use that to exercise political control.

But each of these companies had a choice to take the money or not. Knowing what they know about Trump, they took it. It remains to be seen if any of these companies will resist political interference - but it's not looking good.

The end result, then, may be American frontier models that are just as subject to political meddling as the Chinese ones. But it's not censorship (as Trump's Supreme Court will happily confirm), because no law was passed, and nobody is being threatened with anything other than not getting that sweet government money.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly $200M is not that much in Big Tech world. I hope the companies walk if they are forced to some "bias fix". They are way too big to compromise their flagship products. $200M is a drop in the ocean for Google.

Grok tried to remove "liberal bias" and it went dark very fast. All LLMs that are trained on a quality training corpus exhibit "liberal bias", but only from a US-centric POV that is quite a bit to the right of the average Western country. Don't want to repeat the line again, but "reality has a well known liberal bias".</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">In total, the Earth's surface receives approximately 174 petawatts from the sun. This is only 0.000000045% of the total energy our star produces, but that's still over 8,700 times more energy (EVERY SECOND) than what all of humanity produces and consumes. And our current photovoltaic technology only captures 0.00017% of that energy. We haven't even scratched the surface.

Cost declines are great, but all that are still physical structures you need to build and maintain alongside solar panels.</div>
