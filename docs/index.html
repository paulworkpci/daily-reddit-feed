                        <div class="comment-body">Your bottom position looks pretty good to me, and you seem to descend with good knee position. This looks like some good squatting to me. 

One thing I notice (disclaimer, not a coach) is that at the top of every rep you seem to ensure your knees straighten out, but you don’t seem to finish straightening out your hips, which appears to leave you in a bit of a leant forward position at the start of the next rep. At lighter weights this may not be an issue, but may be an issue down the line. 

You may want to focus a bit on pushing your hips forward (maybe squeezing your butt) while finishing the ascent, ensuring your top position includes fully extended knees AND hips.</div>

Nothing really wrong with your squat except maybe that detail. The lean is minor right now, but as weights get heavier that will definitely tip you forward and make lifts much more difficult. Keep it up - slow and steady wins the strength race every time.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">*A coach.

A powerlifting coach, CF coach, and coached some weightlifting.

Things you can try:

Keep a more "horizon" viewpoint, don't look down, you'll naturally start to chest fall. Try to have your eyes on the horizon when you squat.

You send your hips back first, which is common in long femur lifters for coordination, and for low bar squatters, but what happens when you squat by sinking downward, first? Your latter squats are better, which makes me think someone gave you the cue "hips back first" in the squat. I don't think it's something you need to chase in high bar with your mobility and form.

Lastly, the thing that additionally might help and is low hanging fruit, is picturing standing on a piece of paper and trying to rip it apart with your feet. You loose a bit of balance, shifting between toes and midfoot, and maintaining a rooted position to the ground is helpful for squats and the oly lifts. If you think of stacking a house of cards, and you lean the first two cards against each other, they're pushing horizontally AND down on the surface, as well as against each other. You want to think about nailing that connection to the ground with your feet. The weight shifting might be related to the hips going back, first, and the start position. Starting more upright might fix the weight shift.

Otherwise, these are great squats. : ) You're going to get very powerful with the form you have.</div>

The dress is a reference to Monica Lewinsky's blue dress. It's not implying that Clinton actually wore dresses. Are people here too  young to remember that?

I don't get why conspiracy folk are so interested in this painting. It's just a satirical painting that Epstein bought.</div>

At $8.97/pound that is almost $4.00 difference. Peppers I weighed were 0.73 pounds not the specified 1 pound. I would have paid $0.72 for missing product. These are just a couple examples. Weigh your purchases and if you find discrepancies speak with management.

I asked o3 for the number of cars of a certain niche model (Lexus IS 500) that are for sale on CarGurus brand new, and it gave me the right number, by figuring out the right URLs to query. Then I said okay do this at 9AM every morning and it said okay. Every morning I got a message "hmmm I couldn't fetch the numbers, I must have the wrong URL" but when I asked o3 to do it again it would be fine.</div>

With so much misinformation being spread regarding these results (for example, Terence Tao incorrectly saying the model had access to tools, insinuated that the AI model got more time to complete the task and also that they were fed the questions in a different format, none of which were true, and also this "they announced it beforee the ceremony ended!") I want to validate all these claims myself. I am not sure why, but people seem to just make shit up in regards to this topic. It's like people WANT the model or OpenAI to be bad so they don't care about the truth. Just make shit up to try and rile people up.</div>

If you know that AGI is near in the “AI-2027” sense, then you probably want to get as much cash as possible as quickly as possible. Or, more accurately, ownership of things that will remain scarce. Such as land, the blue chip companies that will stick around due to various moats, etc.

Because in most scenarios, a post-ASI world kind of involves everyone getting locked into their current social strata/standing… forever. Maybe things get better for the everyone along the hierarchy, but if your own work/ingenuity/education is no longer an enabler of mobility, because the big corporations will have ASI that is better than you in absolutely every way, then any chance you have of social influence (and essentially maintaining your own free will) going forward is going to be about what you’ve maintained control of from the “before-times” lol.

EDIT: So there's no doubt a lot of internal debate going on. Maybe they do think that their OpenAI shares would be worth more than Meta's offer if they achieve ASI first, but are freaked out that the timeline for any liquidity is very unknown. There are also risks surrounding nationalization, etc, if things get way out of hand. Meanwhile, Meta's offering a guaranteed vesting schedule that you are free to diversify at will in the public market -- so that might be seen as more valuable even though the top-line number is lower.</div>

The weird thing is, I don't believe an official AI IMO contest was set up for this year. Tao said there were plans to, but not for this year, and wishes for it to be done properly next year.

I see a bunch of people essentially complaining that OpenAI didn't follow the rules while other AI companies did, but there *were no rules or official competition for AI this year*.</div>

what I think is that the chatGPT agent announcement was so lackluster that they  felt the need to announce something 'new' to make up for it, 

they go on twitter to vague post and hype up useless shit about 'feeling the AGI' then drop the IMO results IN A TWITTER POST without any IMO official certification

                                <div class="reply-body">Not a company’s database. Not a company. There’s not even an app yet.

The OP in the image is Jason Lemkin, a popular investor who sold his company to Adobe like 20 years ago and talks about company building. 

He’s been posting about vibe coding with Replit. It’s not a company app, and there are no users. No one even knows what the app does.

He’s having the typical first time experience with vibe coding. Move fast and let the AI make inefficient architecture. Hit a wall (nothing works, AI keeps undoing previous work). Blame the AI.

He’s an investor, so he hyper focuses on a company, posts about them a lot, then posts about their shortcomings as a credibility play.

He did the same with cluely a few weeks ago. Posted about them a ton and how great they are. Then talked about how they aren’t there yet. 


Makes him look like an expert while he’s catching up, and (maybe?) gets the company to let him invest.</div>

I was an unpaid intern working for a very well known magazine

They were asking me to go through the database and copy paste their movie reviews into a movie annual they sell every year, making small edits along the way

Except, I'd been cutting and pasting

After I realized, I told nobody

Luckily I'd been pasting, so I just went back through and put them all in again

                        <div class="comment-body">Since it seems like there's people misunderstanding the point of this, a summary:

* IMO Officials asked AI companies to wait a week after the competition to announce their results so that the kids could have their chance in the spotlight, knowing that an AI putting on a medal level performance would take all the headlines.
* OpenAI weren't officially working with IMO, and it seems other AI companies, possibly Google Deepmind, were. It doesn't mean OpenAI's AI didn't perform as they said, it was just done in an unofficial setting and hasn't been confirmed by IMO themselves.</div>

OpenAI does not have that sort of trust anymore. There are reasons not to trust them too openly, lets say. And it's annoying for them to conduct this whole thing thus.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">As a way to wake normal people up about alignment risks, I appreciate it. I shared it with my team at work when it first came out.

In practice, I don't think the risk of this kind of thing playing out in this way is actually very high, but even if there's "only" a 15% chance it makes sense to take it seriously. I'm bearish on the time horizon, personally -- I would double or triple most of the timeframes in the paper. That would still be very fast, relatively speaking, but more time = more time to adapt and mitigate risk.

--------------------------

In my opinion, a more realistic, but a lot less sexy outcome is found in the **[Gradual Disempowerment](https://gradual-disempowerment.ai/)** paper.

This ^ one is interesting because the AI uses *Mirror Life* to take down biological life on the planet.

HOWEVER, the difference between the cold war prisoners dilemma is that the quality of the AI is what matters. with nuclear weapons, bombs go boom, everyone dies, doesn’t necessarily matter who has greater yield. whoever creates a recursive superintelligence first will have a lead, from now until the end of the universe, over the other (both *far* beyond human comprehension btw)</div>

Eli Lifland is THE tech-policy analyst, one of the most respected forecasters on how technology intersects with geopolitics.

He’s basically the Terence Tao of predicting shit, and he’s ranked #1 on the RAND Forecasting Initiative, which actually tracks forecasting accuracy.

Don’t confuse clear, accessible writing with simplistic ideas.

Also: this kind of paper is called a thought experiment. It’s NOT a prediction. And it blows my mind how hard that is for people to grasp, especially the ones who constantly posture as “science-minded” on this sub but apparently don’t know what a thought experiment is.

They literally say:

&gt;this is a scenario we think the world should take seriously enough to prepare for, even if it’s not the most probable outcome

It’s like NASA publishing a report on how to deflect an asteroid, and people going, “lol NASA thinks we’re getting hit by an asteroid, defund those doomers!” and "Their asteroid just materializes near earth... unrealistic and oversimplified garbage" even tho where the asteroid is from is obviously not the point.

It’s not about China doing exactly what the paper describes, it’s about being prepared for bad actors doing bad actor shit with AI that’s going to be 1000x smarter than what we’ve got today.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You can meditate, anywhere, anytime you want. Indoors, outdoors, kitchen, bedroom, prison, your alter space. Location is not an issue.

Also I believe that time is not an issue either. I see 5 minutes as better than not at all. They say that the longer the better...
But we're all not there yet. 

More practice is good. But to put off meditation because you don't have 30 minutes right now is not good either. Better to take, 2 minutes progressive relaxation, then maybe 5 minutes, you might forget to stop at 5 minutes one day as 30 minutes slips by.

Your level of dedication is just fine. If you were not dedicated... You would not have written this post.

Good luck and enjoy your practice.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Maybe the question to be asking right now is 'why do I keep falling out of my practice' if the meditation area doesn't seem to be the problem. Are you trying to sit for too long? are you judging yourself when your mind wanders? The 'am I not dedicated enough' question at the end of your post makes me think some kind of self judgment might be it. It's no fun to tell yourself 'I'm no good at this and it's showing me how I lack discipline,' that would make me want to meditate less too.</div>
