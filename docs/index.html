Come up with one to three grandmother-appropriate stories about the person you are toasting. They can be funny, but must be uplifting and positive. The last story needs to be heartwarming and make your toastee seem like the greatest person who has ever lived.

Get the stories down to five minutes total. From introducing yourself to toasting, five minutes.  People will talk abou...</div>

Inside jokes are great but only if you use it as the punch line and if you can relate it back to your audience.

IE:

"Remember the spam incident?! I hate spam." is out.

But, "I love my brother and I always knew he was destined for domesticity.  The first time he went out grocery shopping when we moved out on our own he came home with 40 cans of spam. Nothing but spam.  I love this man.  I hate spam."</div>

Lots of great advice though in OPs post and I've witnessed a lot of bad toasts because of things he touched on.


Some dudes seem to treat toasts like a comedy open mic and it's no surprise they end up bombing. 


Keep it short, aim for heartwarming, and let's wrap this shit up so we can all get to drinking and dancing. </div>

No coach, no box, came by myself.

One of the only Asian girls on the floor. 



At first I felt really alone. 

I almost missed my first event. 

Had no idea what I was doing.



But by the end, it felt like the Hunger Games… with all my sisters.



I almost didn't sign up because I literally had no box and no coach coming with me.



I train at a commercial gym now after feeling like *too much* at my old box.



Being back, I realized… damn.

For the last 1.5 years, I’ve been coding with ChatGPT and I recently got the wish to maybe switch from it to something else, I feel like over the last few months it has gotten way too stupid. Last year when I wasn’t paying for chatgpt even 4o felt extremely powerful, the only reason I paid chatgpt was to get rid of that 24h limit on 4o, it performed really good after but since the new o models everything has gone to sh*t.

o4-mini, decent up until a few weeks ago, now is a huge mess hal...</div>

It really is unfortunate. I think Trump might honestly be the worst person in the entire world for the American people to have elected on the eve of AI. To thrust that much power onto such an unstable person is bonkers. I wasn't big into the doomer scenarios, but I fully believe if we go down that bad path with AI it will 100% be because of him.</div>

GitHub is a perfectly secure system for storing private code.  The incompetence is in clicking the wrong button to create a public repo, and not setting up organization level controls to prevent this, and not checking and pushing the code.

Accidentally setting up a public repo is hard to do, but whatever, it happens.  Checking takes literally 5 seconds. Not setting up organization controls, Not checking after setting up, and not checking before you push are so incompetent that I don’t have an analogy.  Maybe leaving the nuclear codes on the counter in McDonald’s.</div>

Fuck Trump I wouldn't shed a tear if he dropped dead, but  idk why this video is just now blowing up. We tried to warn you about this back in 2018 but half the country didn't listen because "MSNBC bad" or something. He has not been shy about wanting to be a dictator. Idk why some people are just now realizing it.</div>

Him and his gang of evil pricks are actively manufacturing problems related to immigration, sowing chaos, creating a divide in American society, and would like nothing more than to arrest political rivals. 
If given the excuse and backing to institute martial law, I’ve no doubt it’d be done. He only looks for ways to enrich himself and his cronies. America is just another company for him to bankrupt and line his pockets when he walks out the door.</div>

They give 1000 credits for the first 3 days after subscription. I don't think that Hailuo 02 is usable yet, and one generation takes like 20min. 

Not meaningful for actual use, but really damn impressive for the AI race!</div>

I know these models don’t have audio and this is only one benchmark. But I really thought that Google had a bit of a moat here with all of YouTube, their compute and team working on this. I expected a good 6 months+ before serious competition would arrive.

As others have said this is good. The further this Nazi saluting ket addict is from having a SOTA model the better.

For these models to work at all they need to represent conceptS in a high dimensional laten space.  And to be consistent and coherent.. they need to model these concepts coherently.  

Much of "left" wing indoctrination is just fallowing through with our stated ethics.  The reason models seem to lean left. Is because the models are converging in that direction. To get anything else, you need to fine tune it on nonsense. Which means the model will go to shit since it can't converge on anything... or it needs to learn double think.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey, I was so tired of having to put a shit ton of logging or breakpoints into AI code to debug it that I built this tool. AI code is weird to work with because it is often so subtly wrong and at the same time completely foreign to their creator (now that we don't even write the code).

Traditional debuggers expects you (or the AI) to know pretty well where to put breakpoints, and are just tiring to use imo (I know this is a huge debate), and logging, well at least AI is half decent at putting it, but it's often missing the first time you encounter the bug so now you need to reproduce, furthermore it's annoying to maintain, and to read walls of logs.

So I built this debugging tool where you have basically 0 things to change with your code or ask AI to do, just run your JS/TS/Python code normally from the terminal but add the \`ariana\` command before (for example: ariana python my\_script.py). It will transform and run your code like a compiler to add custom observability. Note that it will transform the files on my server, I'll publish a self hosted version soon. For now I did it this way so I could later add LLMs into the mix so observability is super custom to your program's semantics.

Then I made a VSCode extension to consume the debugging data like you've seen in the vid: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dedale-dev.ariana](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dedale-dev.ariana)  
It installs the CLI for you btw.

You can also copy all the data and give to your agent to debug

The whole philosophy of the tool is to always run your code with it and never have to reproduce bugs again because you can basically know all that the code did the first time a bug appears. At least that's what I'm working towards. Hope one day some (small) projects will even use it in prod.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Valiant effort from the #6 Penske Porsche which placed second as well, given the pace advantage that the Ferraris had on the rest of the field.

Kevin Estre in particular drove like an absolute madman in the opening stint to get that car into a position where it could legitimately take advantage of the Ferraris having any issues (which the two works entries did later in the race), and all three drivers plus the pit crew didn't put a step wrong all race.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">So glad to see him win the pinncle of endurance racing after so much misfortune in his career. He was poised to drive for Ferrari in F1 before his accident took place. 

&gt;can’t help but think what they could do if the f1 team was a fraction as well put together as AF Corsa.

Going from seeing AF Corsa Le Mans strategy to watching Scuderia Ferrari fumble so hard in Canada was a hell of a whiplash. Tbf, the actual works Ferrari AF Corsa team took some terrible strategic calls at Le Mans as well.

 
It's great to see Ferrari at the helm of endurance racing but it does beg the question about the effectiveness of the regulatory bodies that are incharge of the BoP. The same team winning 3 years in a row at Le Mans and is clearly miles apart from the rest of the grid (apart from Penske Posche #6). I personally feel that BoP should be scrapped for the Hypercars but they should instead be placed under a strict budget and technical limitation cap (although not as strict as F1).</div>
