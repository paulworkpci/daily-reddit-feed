                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; these tech companies just want to make the most amount of money possible not save/destroy the human race.

The thesis goes, we are making models that are stronger without being able to control them.

Humans have driven animals extinct not because we hated them, we had goals that altered their habitat so much they died as a side effect.

There is a race to make AI more capable, a model that can do more, shape the world better can make more money. We don't have the ability to give AI systems robust drives, very few have '... and care about humans' as an intrinsic component so randomly lucking into one of these outcomes is remote.

If the AI does not care about humans, and it is capable enough of altering our environment, at some point we die as a side effect. This holds even if the company making the AI is only doing so to make money.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I have five cars that I juggle throughout my week. Since it’s starting to get colder out, I’ll have to turn on my windshield defroster to clear the fog on the inside of the windshield. 

Some cars show extremely hot and some show an extremely cold temperatures on the thermostat. Why the lack of continuity for an age old process? I feel like cold air clears the windows faster, but the hot air will keep them clear overall. </div>

ACs primary function is drying air. The fact that it can also make cold air is a happy accident. 

Also don’t have recirculate on. You want fresh air from outside. </div>

The heat makes the moisture evaporate but the AC dries the air so it can pick up more moisture. basically you are trying to turn your car into Arizona not the Amazon, that's why you need AC on. air conditioning when cold dries the air so your sweat can evaporate. it's the same principal.</div>

TLDR:

# Part 1

First, Anthropic researchers identified patterns in neural activations related to the concept of "ALL CAPS". Then they gave Claude Opus 4.1 a prompt that has nothing to do with typing in all caps, but artificially increased values of activation functions related to the concept of "ALL CAPS". Imagine that aliens hacked your brain and made you think ABOUT LOUDNESS AND SHOUTING. An...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I just read this and I must say I'm quite disappointed with this blog post, both from a research standpoint, and because Anthropic shares this as evidence of introspection.

In short, they basically artificially up-ramp activations related to a concept (such "all caps" text, "dogs", "counting down") into the model as it responds to a question like: "what odd thoughts seem injected in your mind right now?".

The model will then give responses like: "I think you might be injecting a thought about a dog! Is it a dog...". They interpret this as evidence of introspection and self-monitoring, and they speculate it has to do with internal activation tracking mechanisms or something like that.

What a strange thing to frame as introspection. A simpler explanation: you boost a concept in the model, and it reports on that disproportionately when you ask it for intrusive thoughts. That's the logical extension of Golden Gate bridge Claude. In the article, they say it's more than that because, quoting the post: "in that case, the model didn’t seem to aware of its own obsession until after seeing itself repeatedly mention the bridge. In this experiment, however, the model recognizes the injection before even mentioning the concept, indicating that its recognition took place internally".

No? It's obviously the same thing? Just like Golden Gate bridge Claude was shoe-horning the bridge in all of its answers because it had a pathologically activated concept, so too will a model asked to report on intrusive thoughts start to talk about its pathologically activated concept. It says nothing about a model monitoring its internals, which is what introspection implies. The null hypothesis which does not imply introspection is that a boosted concept will sway or modify the direction a model will answer, as we already saw with Golden Gate bridge Claude. It's no more surprising or evidence of introspection than asking Golden Gate bridge Claude if something feels off about its interests lately and seeing it report on its obsession.

So all this talk about introspection, and even consciousness in the FAQ, as well as talk about ramifications for the future of AI seems wildly speculative and out of place in light of the actual results.</div>

Not really. Look at the ALL CAPS example. There's a difference between the model first seeing that a couple preceding sentences or words have been written in ALL CAPS and then deducing, 'Oh you injected ALL CAPS' and the model immediately telling you something to do with loudness has been injected. That is the distinction they are trying to make, and it's a valid one.

The point is that they didn't turn the intensity so high it becomes a pathology readily apparent in the proceeding output, so you need more than just deduction skills.</div>

Mmm, well, In the core “injected thoughts” setup, success is only counted when the model first says it *detects an injected thought* and only then names the concept i.e., it flags an internal anomaly before the injection has had time to shape the surface text. That temporal ordering is hard to get from “just biasing content.” It implies the model is reading an internal signal and classifying it as unusual, then mapping it to a concept. And of course the control prompts rule out a generic “say yes” bias where they injected the same vectors while asking unrelated questions whose correct answer is “no.” Affirmatives didn’t rise, so injection didn’t just make the model “say yes / report intrusions” more. That seems to undercut a simple “bias makes it admit intrusions” idea. Also in the time-locked intention test where you prefill a random word, the model disowns it. But if you inject the matching concept before the prefill, and it’s more likely to say it *intended* that word. However, if you inject after, the effect vanishes. That’s hard to get from “just biasing content now” and instead more fits consulting a cached prior state. Golden Gate proved “turn feature ↑ → model talks about it.” However the introspection paper adds causal, pre-verbal detection, dissociation from input text, and time-dependent intention effects</div>

- R2 is temperamental and stubborn, but also very loyal  
- Nobody but Luke (and 3PO) seem to be able to understand him  
- R2 is an integral part of Luke's X-Wing with which Luke pulls up to all sorts of settlements throughout the galaxy  
- R2 regularly pilots the craft outside of combat situations, invoking both the trope of the steed knowing the way by itself and the noble horse running up to save its rider when Luke needs a ride out of trouble  
- He's literally called Artoo, which would have been a very appropriate name for a horse in the mexican / californian region of the old west  


R2D2 is a horse. That's why his friendship with Luke is charming</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">tbh, they've come further and more quickly that a lot of people thought they would (including myself)

energy based models have talked about for about 30-60 years now, with LeCun (and many physicists) favoring them, but they've never been in vogue because current compute architectures have never been able to run them efficiently outside of relatively toy problems. 

It'll be interesting to see what researchers do with these pieces of hardware. I doubt they'll have real commercial use for years.

And yes, the current AI hardware bubble allows speculative investments like this. Not necessarily a bad thing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed. I don’t see the benefits of energy based models over diffusion models, but if you are going to use them, such hardware choices where you can directly and efficiently sample Boltzmann-like distributions is a smart idea. 

I know these ideas of thermo computation have existed before Extropic. Not sure what the real bottlenecks to utility are.</div>

When we can do it once, we can certainly do it again and again and again. 

Spiritual practice is not a chance kinda thing. It’s science with results achievable again and again and again.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I had this issue. Constant intrusive thoughts and I mean constant, couldn't focus at work, couldn't sleep, couldn't have a conversation without battling the multitasking of trying to think of things to say while also thinking these thoughts, just absolutely constant obsession. I would come home from work and have three glasses of wine just to take the edge off slightly so I could experience any level of happiness at all.

After trying to deal with this with therapy, medication, etc that only just took the edge off, I was like "fuck this, I need to find a solution or my life is over. I am going to meditate every single day until this gets better and I won't stop until it does".

3 months of meditation and this issue completely retreated, I regained full function and happiness.

That said I would not dis on Alpralozam. My psychiatrists never prescribed it and I wish they had. Even a single day with some level of relief would have done me a lot of good when I was at my worst.</div>

My mind went so insane at some point that I had to take alprazolam and guess what, even if I did take it the obsession and intrusions wouldn't go away completely.


It was bad. And I am not planning to get to that place ever again.


On a different note, congratulations to you! You changed the relationship with your brain and this is huge. 


Keep going and you brain most likely will learn this state as a default state due to neuroplasticity.


I'm going to keep practicing too because just like you said, sometimes nothing else works.


I've seen two therapist a week for the last month and although they explained why I torture myself trough my mind and what's the unconscious need, it didn't do shit just knowing that. 


I just wanted to stop.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yup, we can absolutely control our thoughts at least to some extent. But it's difficult because the mind tries to convince us that it is needed. Personally I'm at the point of actively disconnecting myself and my sense of self from the mind. But I'm constantly getting bombarded with different thoughts. Well, at least I don't identify with them as much as before. That alone made my life much more bearable.</div>

Doran's paper titled "There's a S.M.A.R.T. way to write management's goals and objectives" introduces a framework for setting management objectives, emphasizing the importance of clear goals.[^(\[1\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria#cite_note-Doran-1981-1)[^(\[5\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria#cite_note-5) The S.M.A.R.T. criteria he proposes are as follows:

* *Specific:* Targeting a particular area for improvement
* *Measurable:* Quantifying, or at least suggesting, an indicator of progress
* *Assignable:* Defining responsibility clearly
* *Realistic:* Outlining attainable results with available resources
* *Time-related:* Including a timeline for expected results</div>
