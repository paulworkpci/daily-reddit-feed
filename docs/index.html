Pros imagine a truthful AGI being released within a fascist or dictator state.



Cons imagine a lying AGI being released within a fascist or dictator state.



What are the best and worst possible outcomes of AGI released within a fascist or dictator state?

Or a fascist or dictator AGI released with a democracy?</div>

That is why it is super important that AI masters be aligned - not necessarily their tools. What Elon did with grok is really scary because if it worked it would’ve potentially brainwashed billions into believing fabricated propaganda which he needs to push his own goals forward.</div>

Everyone in the state is monitored 24/7 by AI systems making dissent impossible. The governed is run by a dictatorship aligned super intelligence, preventing it from making mistakes and preventing a benevolent dictator ever taking power. The police are staffed by autonomous machines that outnumber the population, making armed resistance impossible. All labour is replaced by ai/robotics reducing the economic value of people to nothing and taking away the possibility of passive resistance. All information is controlled by AI systems, so people do not even understand the situation they are in.  
  
Best case scenario? 
We never discover how to fully align AI systems, so they can't be fully aligned to dictatorships, however they don't kill us all either. I don't think this is likely.</div>

The AGI-driven utopias people in this sub want, would *require* this type of setup to maintain. There cannot be permanent, lasting peace and zero crime etc etc etc without extreme surveillance from a centralized source of power.

It's interesting that in your description you never mention malevolence. If you give all that power to a *malevolent* actor then yes it's bad. But if they're benevolent, where's the issue?

The "gay space communism" utopias are incompatible with the idea of distributing open source AGI to everyone.  That would just mean there will always be some sources of conflict, especially since... A whole large group of people are not going to agree with the communist ideals so they're going to be utilizing "their" AGI to upend the new paradigm.</div>

For the time being, Natural General Intelligence gives us all implicit economic value to the rich and powerful. The arrival of cost-effective AGI robs us of that, and makes us economic burdens instead.

                <div class="post-content">This is a merely probable speculation! For example, o3 mini was really good in the beginning and it was probably q8 or BF16. After collecting data and fine tuning it for a few weeks, then  they started to quantize it after a few weeks to save money, then you notice  the quality starts to degrade .  Same with gemini 2.5 pro 03-24, it was good then the may version came out it was fine tuned and quantized to 3-4 bits. This is why the new nvidia gpus have native fp4 support, to help companies to sav...</div>

The ChatGPT version of GPT-4o has an API endpoint: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/chatgpt-4o-latest, and since a few of our apps use it, we run daily benchmarks. We've never noticed any sudden performance drops or other shenanigans.

The openai subreddit has been claiming daily for years, "OMG, the model got nerfed!", and you'd think with millions of users and people scraping outputs nonstop, at least one person would have provided conclusive proof by now. But since no such proof exists, it's probably not true.</div>

"open source" isn't some magical words that can make anything happen, you still can't run a top model on your PC, so you have to find a cloud computing service to run it and then the open source models are almost never going to be at the same level as private models due to simple economic incentives, so the most likely scenario is that you get a similar strength to the quantized models while paying significantly more for it.</div>

Is it just hype or are others here seriously switching over? Would love to hear what setups you're using now.</div>

On the Vectara leaderboard, o3 mini high has the second lowest hallucination rate out of all the llms measured at 0.8%, only behind gemini 2.0 flash at 0.7% https://github.com/vectara/hallucination-leaderboard

For simpleQA, the highest scoring model is a reasoning model https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/ai-simpleqa-leaderboard/

Even in the article, they state

&gt;The Vectara team pointed out that, although the DeepSeek-R1 model hallucinated 14.3 per cent of the time, most of these were “benign”: answers that are factually supported by logical reasoning or world knowledge, but not actually present in the original text the bot was asked to summarise. DeepSeek didn’t provide additional comment.

Most of the benchmarks I've look into specifically tests non-factual things, asking either questions without answers, asking it to respond only taking into account the context, or in the worse case putting information in the context that contradicts reality. All of which is a valid benchmark, but not necessarily representative of your every day experience.

So my theory is that maybe old models have a lower hallucination rate relative to unknown content, but because they knew so much less that still resulted in significantly more overall hallucinations.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You've completely misunderstood.  Bostrom has written extensively about the threat from AI and did so years before 95% of the people in the thread ever looked at the tech.  He's not saying "we're not there", he's saying the threat of us being there is a lot greater now and there are no clear barriers to ASI happening.  

It's not a prediction that ASI is coming in two years, it's a statement that *there is less reason to believe that it cannot happen* in the coming two years.</div>

Still probably the best overall value in the class. Easily available with discounts, huge interior, standard AWD. The touchscreen, fuel economy and shifter/ clutch feel are what kept me from buying one.</div>

She called back the old dentist and asked which teeth etc. And then said "it's funny because I just went and took x-rays and I don't have any cavities, could you explain it to my dentist?" and they refused, got agitated and then hung up on her.

https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/deepseek-rushes-launch-new-ai-model-china-goes-all-2025-02-25/

"Deepseek had planned to release R2 in early May but now wants it out as early as possible, two of them said, without providing specifics."

Well, "early may" has come and gone, so not only are they not releasing it early...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">[When Compilers Were the 'AI' That Scared Programmers](https://vivekhaldar.com/articles/when-compilers-were-the--ai--that-scared-programmers/)

&gt;One of the most frequent arguments against compilers was that compiled code could not be as efficient or compact as handwritten assembly. People would say they could be more efficient in assembly, giving a whole litany of reasons to avoid high-level languages. And this was not entirely untrue. The earliest compilers sometimes did produce verbose or suboptimal machine language. A 1965 Honeywell management briefing noted candidly that a highly skilled assembly programmer could still beat COBOL’s output in efficiency. But it also questioned how many highly skilled programmers are available or even needed at the average installation.

...

&gt;There was an implicit fear that making programming easier might reduce the prestige or necessity of the seasoned programmer. High-level languages opened the door for newcomers to write code without years of experience in binary or assembly. The priesthood culture, Bacchus described, suggests that some experts guarded this domain closely.

&gt;Grace Hopper encountered this attitude when promoting compilers. Management and colleagues initially thought the idea of automatic programming was crazy, fearing it would make programmers obsolete. Hopper and others had to repeatedly demonstrate that these tools would augment programmers’ productivity, not replace the need for skilled people.

The way I see it: I've noticed two things have happened over the past 20 years in programming/coding:

1. Software development has become easier than ever
2. Software development has become more complex than ever

I imagine it's going to be the same thing here, which is why everyone is having a hard time predicting the future with it. We look back now and see what happened: coding become more accessible, more capable, and (most importantly) *more complex*.

I know AI is "different", but some are arguing...[how different](https://ben11kehoe.medium.com/the-end-of-programming-will-look-a-lot-like-programming-8b877c8efef8)? I am already starting to see that these tools are enabling more complexity to take shape, where software itself is going to increase in complexity in terms of the problems it can solve. This means we'll be pushing these systems to their limits, and needing highly technically oriented and skilled individuals to work with these systems that keep growing in complexity (and lots of them).

Hell, I just watched a YouTube of a developer who was orchestrating an MCP with Claude Code and integrating with Cursor along with TaskMaster and Gemini 2.5. It was *so much more complex* than any development workflow I've seen to date. In other words, we're not going to take the techie out of the tech industry, and there will never be a shortage of needs and desires from the public.

Yes, there will be shifts, there always are; you don't need a programmer any longer to create simple websites (Wix, SquareSpace, Webflow) or even simple applications (Airtable, Bubble.io), but there's still more work than ever to go around, with a backlog that has only grown by leaps and bounds.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I've seen this comparison being thrown a lot ("it's happened before"), but frankly no matter how you frame it, it's not the same. Compilers were a predictable, higher level abstraction that produced repeatable results. AI isn't that. 


In fact, hallucinations and performance degradation worsening as the scale of application grows are the biggest hurdles it needs to overcome. Challenges which are seeing farther and farther away as recent AI advancements keep getting smaller and smaller than the exponential leaps we were used to.


Anyways, I agree there's too much doom posting going around, but I personally find claims like "this has happened before" trying to normalize AI like it completely replaced programming to be just as harmful.


I wish there was more nuance to this conversation than people trying to either a) sell the idea AI makes coding ability importan or b) pretend relying on AI is the biggest sin imaginable. Like there is no in-between</div>

Leave it to Musk to push the Overton window so far, so quickly with his heavy-handed “White Genocide” and Holocaust questioning tactics.

Edit: I’m actively trying to figure out Musk. This article is really something. I don’t know what to think.

https://alisoncrosthwait.substack.com/p/a-ketamine-addicts-perspective-on

I don’t believe he did it to push the public’s view of the actual events, rather, he did it explicitly to normalize irresponsible AI for personal gain.

Musk as a paperclip maximizer. But he maximizes his own personal freedom of future action at every step. And then he paints a human face on it.

It’s a lot like Kanye, it’s a lot like Trump. Dumb people eat that shit up. It normalizes seeing things being done without principles, and to some degree makes principled approaches appear naïve. It normalizes the worst.

We need to keep the cautious data science approach. If we lose it, we’re fucked.</div>
