Just because we make tech that makes incredibly complex things *seem* simple, does not make them so. If chess were simple, then go get a pro level elo in a month. Even if you’re intelligent and spend all day playing, like those twitch streamers twins, it still takes thousands upon thousands of hours of play, and a master still beats you 9.5/10 times, never mind a grand master.</div>

You can spray Lysol on a paper towel and then wipe the offending writing away, or depending on the surface you can spray directly on the writing and then wipe it off with paper or cloth. 

As with most cleaning methods, try a small spot first. </div>

The expo marker trick is probably the best for your buck though. In the reverse of this, you could theoretically use printer ink (which is stored in methanol) or also use butanol, which is hard to come as anything but a chemistry business.</div>

In fact, I just took a stab at the start of such a story.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The crows know who I am, and are interested. They watch from the telephone wires, heads tilting, as if weighing my intentions. When I walk beneath them, they shift their feet and murmur in low, conspiratorial tones, a council debating a motion.

They arrived a week ago, silently. I first noticed them when I took Charlie for a walk out in the back field. He saw them too and cocked his head. At first, they merely observed, black silhouettes against the autumn sky.

By the third day, they'd grown bolder, following me from tree to tree, their shadows flickering over the dying vegetation like spilled ink. Their chatter startled Charlie, and that made me laugh. Somehow, the birds seemed amused as well. One of them hopped closer, regarding me with an eye like a drop of oil. He was confident, borderline insolent, head moving in a way that almost felt like a nod. Or a challenge.

There was something familiar in that bobbing motion. It unsettled me, but I couldn't yet say why.

Charlie pressed against my leg. With a thumb and forefinger, I rubbed the silky inside of his ear and he gave a quiet, contented moan. The crows seemed to press closer. A gust of wind rattled the dry grass, but they didn’t stir. They weren’t there for food, I sensed, nor did they seem wary of me. They were waiting for something else.

Finally, one of them dropped from its branch, gliding down to land a few feet ahead, then picked at the ground with deliberate precision. When it looked up again, I saw something clamped in its beak. A glint of metal, dull with age. It took a few short steps forward and let the object fall.

A key.

It's not that you don't have anything better to do. It's that your coping with boredom and negative emotions that keeps bring you back to your phone. Like a drug addict, idle hands are the devils playground. 


Being on your phone increases feelings of loneliness even when you're "interacting" with people
 Your brain doesn't recognize it as socializing and you don't get the same chemical response. You also experience more stress. Notifications and a flood of information, even just others stupid opinions, cause anxiety and over stimulation. Reading reduces stress and causes calmness. It's why reading before bed is great for sleep and scrolling is the worst thing for sleep. Even watching TV is significantly better because it doesn't have the never ending addictive properties of social media and youtube. 


Studies have shown that hobbies take awhile to get into. Especially if you have a phone addiction cuz attention spans suffer and make it hard to get satisfaction from doing something that takes practice. Just like Watchung a movie probably feels like a chore. Don't give up. Keep pursing freedom from your phone and you'll feel better and never want to go back.</div>

In ireland now, he has a new name on social media: "Andrew Tayto".

If you’ve struggled with putting off your biggest dreams, it’s a worthwhile guide to start making real progress.</div>

When you have clear physical goals and are doing the least amount of work on them, you just achieve them very fast. 

That's why "soulmate"/"friends", "getting a dream job", "being happy", "getting a 6 pack", etc. goals often fail (just trying to think of common lifetime goals). 

It might just not be clear what a "six pack" is! Even if you are happy, it might not be clear you are!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Here’s the story…
One day we’re driving around together (already married 8+ years and 2 kids), and I randomly asked him if he wanted to stop at an adult store together. He almost gave us whiplash he swung the car around so fast in his excitement. 
When we went inside, I didn’t really have anything in mind that I wanted to buy. Just window shopping, I guess. 
He cleverly steered me over to the section with the cuffs and restraints, and we chose some items together. One of them was a deck of cards with kinky prompts, and we went through pretty much every one of those cards in the next several months, as we “played” together. 
He had never mentioned any of this being a turn on for him previously, so it felt organic, but later he told me he was just waiting for the right opportunity, and I had given it to him in the guise of a trip to a chain adult store.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You guys do know that multiple things can be true: the Palestinians are being killed en mass by the IDF and Hamas can be skum that will treat civilians like meat. 

They’re not exclusive. History and probability dictate that there was almost definitely rapes/abuses from each side. Unfortunately that’s the reality of war. 

But to demand evidence of a rape in a war zone is kinda insane, it almost definitely happened. Both sides of the conflict are evil. IDF vs Hamas. Leave the civilians out of this.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Aren't we a little bit past the point of "both sides" on this issue? Should we maybe compare the death tolls from both sides? Who killed more civilians, more women and children, and by what order of magnitude? And should we consider what might have happened in the 60 years before October 7th? 

Here's a different question: would you condemn the leaders of a slave revolt that resulted in the death of civilians? And if that revolt failed, and the slave owning class slaughtered many more men, women, and children in retaliation, would you say that those who led the rebellion were just as guilty as those who engaged in that slaughter?</div>

They did and there’s zero evidence. Zero video or photographic evidence. But it *was* broadcasted over every digital, local, national, and worldwide news channel for weeks. 

It’s the shot heard around the world. Now if only we could find the bullet.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's so funny. They keep trying new elements and posting extra videos to make it hard for people to call it fake, cgi or ai generated.

Some people thought the first dancing video was fake, so they posted [another video](http://xhslink.com/a/zEam9blFQxo8) with a mirror behind the robot while they hit it with balls and sticks.

Same thing for the kung fu video, so they posted [another video](http://xhslink.com/a/AwY6ZkrYyzo8) but with the ceo in frame interacting with it.

For the side-flip video, they just had someone firing [confetti](https://youtu.be/29xLWhqME2Q?si=8hvp6ZjJ1ch_HcvU) at it.

And for this most recent one, they have people in the background and interacting with the robot again, and now they finally added text.

Some people will still think they're fake, even with all that. But as more companies showcase the same capabilities, like in that recent Boston Dynamics video, it'll just keep getting harder to stay a skeptic and call them fake.</div>

Just wait until they figure out you can apply consistency directly to chain of thought which works better than applying it to final results.​​​​​​​​​​​​ Now you get 4 SCALING LAWS!!!</div>

There are probably methods to refine this further so instead of 'simple' search you're reducing the total space to explore. With this said, LLMs typically do better with more text (within their context window) so there is probably an inflection point somewhere.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/KedaKitten:

Location: Daytona, Florida     

Time: March 17th, 2025, 10pm     

Description of sighting: This user @cocosongz submitted several videos showing large orbs of light above the ocean. She states they are emerging from the water itself, then hovering above it.      

I'm curious as to whether anyone has seen these videos or similar and would like to share their thoughts, or whether there have been any explanations found. There is quite a large discussion surrounding recent sightings in this specific area, and many mentions of the presence of whistleblowers and military officials. Some even mention the belief that a large craft or "mother ship" has been found under the surface of the surrounding waters.

                        <div class="comment-body">She was live on Tik tok https://www.tiktok.com/@cocosongz. She has multiple videos of it posted.

She claims she had a LOT more footage and had other 6 friends recording, but somehow a lot of their footage got deleted. This reminds me of the “drone” incident where some people were recording the drones and their phones messed up or the drone turned off their DJI drones mid air when flying close to it

Edit: she also claimed there were black helicopters following her the day after. Which is consistent to ufo witnesses and whistleblowers the past few decades</div>
