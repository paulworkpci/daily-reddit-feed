Up to now robots have always been ''oh wow look its almost doing what humans do, its like a clumsy human, we are getting there''

This is the first time i see a robot do something i just couldnt do. 

Like going from GPT3 being coherent for a few minutes to GPT4 reading 10 scientific papers and condensing the information for you. (The analogy might not be perfect idk, but you know what i mean)</div>

                <div class="post-content">In the Verizon app, go to profile and setting, and then "Number transfer pin".  Just going to that prompted an offer of $20 a month off of my phone line for a year. This might not work for everyone, but it's worth a try.

Edit: It sent me a text and asked me to call *611 to confirm. I connected to chat and was able to confirm, and my new bill shows $40 a month savings, $20 per line.  So make sure you confirm it via chat or a call, clicking the button isn't enough.</div>

```
npx -y @just-every/code
```

The code and docs are available on GitHub at https://github.com/just-every/code. It supports orchestrating agents from various providers and aims to be a flexible coding companion.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">People who read this as OpenAI's fault are incorrect in ways that are trivial and clear.

First, just Google what an anchor knot is. ChatGPT did not tell him how to make a noose. It offered info on how to tie a safer knot that can't be used to kill yourself with. Second, identifying that a rope can handle 150-250 lbs static weight is a lot like blaming chatgpt for telling someone that yes a knife can cut your wrist. It's hardly analysis. 

That is also btw all chatgpt did for instruction. Anything else stated is stated without receipts. 

Third, telling him that his suicide is beautiful and story esque ignores the timeline. His suicide was April 11th and first day of school would have been April 14th. That means this was the context of a short term tangible suicide plan from someone who has the means. That's an acute emergency and the rules are totally different. The rules are that with very few exceptions, you buy whatever time you can. Buying days is exceptional. In the transcript, chatgpt even tried to chip away at the suicide narrative by saying he was giving the world one last chance. A+

Fourth, validating that his previous attempt was real follow through is textbook for handling one of the riskiest suicide profiles, which is someone who failed and is shame spiraling about where they'll be seen as manipulative and causing drama. ChatGPT gave textbook ASIST response and redditors are too dumb to notice it. 

I'm also just not convinced by one context-free sentence saying "please don't leave the noose out" that anything wrong happened. We all know context matters and the NYT article also says that Adam lied to chatgpt about context to get past guardrails. Depending on what he told chatgpt and when, that may have been a good reply. They did not post receipts.</div>

Personally, I feel we don't know nearly enough about the relationship with the parents. I hate to say it, but the mom saying "ChatGPT killed my son" feels a lot like projection from a grieving mom having a hard time accepting she didn't catch on earlier or provide a space where her son felt they could safely speak up about these feelings. 

I'm not blaming the parents per se, but as someone who has quite a few attempts under their belt I can say parents really can be oblivious even when they mean well.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Exactly. His likely J broken Ai should not be in question here. But rather, everything else in his life. They should check his reddit activity... I've seen some grossly upsetting comments on posts giving advice on ways to end one's self

And sama will just use this as an excuse to pull back from all the customization options he was saying he would add too

You can kiss compassionate Ai goodbye. 4o included

All because his parents can't accept they failed their son and had to money grab... sickening

I use to be a suicide hotline operator, don't think I lack compassion for the boy. I've saved many souls from that dark place we all end up at eventually

But let me tell you, people process guilt in volatile ways most of the time. And that's exactly what this is</div>

One minute it’ll tell me one thing, the next it’ll completely contradict itself. It's like all it wants to do is be the best at validating you. It doesn't care if it's right or wrong. It never follows directions anymore. I’ll explicitly tell it not to use certain words or characters, and it’ll keep doing it, and in the same thread. The consistency is gone, the accuracy is gone, and the conversat...</div>

It can't pull stuff 5 prompts ago. There are heavy prompts in between, but I would have estimated it's still within 10K tokens that it should have had no problems.

5-thinking-mini is a little more competent when it comes to pulling stuff. Problem is that it's incredibly preachy. Like every paragraph, sometimes every sentence, has to have "ethical" or "responsible" in it. So annoying to use.</div>

It also wastes a whole paragraph in the beginning basically repeating my prompt back to me.

If I didn’t believe that meditation would help with my anxiety disorder or help me feel at peace I probably wouldn’t do it. If I hadn’t read those studies that showed that meditation decreased anxiety by “x” over a 2 month period, etc. I would probably think it’s voodoo hippie shit like parents.

Just being honest here. I know I have to sit down and pretend that I’m meditating for a deeper reason, and it’s not to feel less anxious, but that’s just not the truth...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Who told you meditation has no purpose? If it had no purpose, people wouldn't become monks. It's okay to have purpose, whether it is to attain Nirvana, to become a Buddhisatva (awakened one who helps others), or to just reduce anxiety in your day to day life. There is absolutely nothing wrong with purpose. In fact, in Mahayana Buddhism, you start your meditation by reaffirming that your meditation is for the purpose of helping others.

What people are maybe telling you is that you need to give up the "assessment" stage, the judging how much anxiety reduction you have achieved every time you meditate, and trust in the process (and in the science behind it.) Think of yourself in a job where, every 5 minutes, your boss shows up and asks "how much progress have you done?". You'll be stressed and miserable. Don't do this to yourself.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It really is as simple as the more you “try”, the less you actually make it to “meditate”. So you’ve just got to trust those who have gone before you and realised that progress is made when you give in to it. Just just a thing. Learn the process and just like a good book. Move slowly through the process. You can’t make must of a story by focusing on the last page, it won’t make the first 20 chapters happen. Just trust the process. Sit with
Your breath. Come back to your breath every time you realise your mind has wandered. Once you have control of your mind you can move onto investegarove meditations and then you will have a goal. With the breath, it’s just getting used to being aware that you are being aware, and that’s is. There is nothing more than that so it is the patu and it is the goal. Well, the goal is to be able to do it without distraction. There, that’s the goal. But the path gets you there, you can’t find a way to sneak around the back and just gain control. It takes time and effort. Then look into Mahayana meditations to get into the more interesting stuff. Good luck</div>

My intention is to suffer less and to have more compassion for myself and others.  Really, I feel like goal and intention can be used interchangeably. I really think it’s important to remind yourself of your intention each time before you meditate.</div>

My initial plan:
- Use it for Cursor (using OpenAI API)

- Other coding tools that support OpenAI API

Other ideas?

What can you guys do if we had $100 allowance OpenAI or OpenRouter credits per month?</div>
