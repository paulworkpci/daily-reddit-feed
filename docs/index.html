                                <div class="reply-body">I already responded to this comment, but my comment isn't showing up for some reason. I said:

Nice comment. Can’t forget Jeffrey Epstein. He specialized in sexual blackmail and hiding/finding money for powerful people connected to intelligence agencies, especially the CIA and Mossad. Epstein himself told several people over the years that he was an intelligence agent. When Epstein was first charged with sex-trafficking in 2008 in Florida, the U.S. attorney for Southern District of Florida, Alex Acosta (Trump’s Labor Secretary), “was told Epstein ‘belonged to intelligence’ and to ‘leave it alone,’” and that Epstein was “above his pay grade.” You can find that quote on wikipedia. Epstein’s side-kick, Ghislaine Maxwell, was the daughter of Mossad superspy Robert Maxwell. Epstein’s mentor and “main client,”  billionaire Les Wexner, had mob connections (specifically to the Pittsburgh Genovese-LaRocca crime family via Edward DeBartolo Sr. and Frank Walsh). [Mobsters connected to that family were involved in the murder of a lawyer named Arthur Shapiro, who was killed in a mob-style hit literally the day before Shapiro was going to testify in a case related to the filing of false tax returns involving Wexner’s company, The Limited (now known as Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc.)](https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/08/investigative-reports/a-kingpin-the-mob-and-a-murder-the-deeper-mystery-behind-the-arthur-shapiro-homicide/). Another client of Epstein’s was the Saudi Arabian businessman Adnan Khashoggi, who was the middleman in transferring American weapons from Israel to Iran as part of the Iran–Contra affair in the 1980s. Investigative journalist and fellow anarchist Whitney Webb has detailed everything Epstein related ad nauseam on Unlimited Hangout and in her [two volume magnum opus “One Nation Under Blackmail: The Sordid Union Between Intelligence and Organized Crime that Gave Rise to Jeffrey Epstein.”](https://archive.org/details/one-nation-under-blackmail-vol-1-2-whitney-alyse-webb\_202401). Her interviews with Bitcoiner Natalie Brunell will give you an idea of how knowledgable she is. [Here’s the first one](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf978q67pQs&amp;pp=ygUcbmF0YWxpZSBicnVuZWxsIHdoaXRuZXkgd2ViYg%3D%3D).

The real dichotomy isn’t white vs black, rich vs poor, right vs left, but the rulers (state and its cronies) vs the ruled. Things will only continue to get worse if they don’t realize this. These people are wealthy because of their connections to government. Rich folks will always exist. What we average people should desire is a world wherein the wealthiest amongst us are rich because they’ve provided the most value to the largest number of people, rather than because they have the most cronies in government.

[We can’t vote our way to freedom](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n8ETV2MzHuY). [Democracy is guaranteed to lead to further centralization and tyranny](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qrl8YorTa1U). If states are going to exist at all, [they should be decentralized, smaller, localized and a far better reflection of average people living with said polities](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m\_hWr834h4M&amp;pp=ygULI2RvcG9saXRpZXM%3D).

Society can be organized in one of [two ways; inorganically from the top-down utilizing force via a rigid, unchanging and tyrannical centralized authority, or organically from the bottom-up utilizing voluntary cooperation via a flexible and dynamic decentralized system of individuals that have mutual respect for one another and protect the inalienable rights of individuals. In other words, force or freedom](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kURsX5fq3CM).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Just for shits and giggles I figured this out:

To make what is generally considered the minimum living wage in the United States ($50,000/year) an individual working 40 hours a week would have to make $24.04/hr (more than three times the national minimum wage).

If a person worked 40 hours a week and grossed $1 Billion a year they would be making:

$133.55

                        <div class="comment-body">The Swedish ship Vasa.

The Vasa was built in the 1620s to take advantage of the very newest in warship technology, a second row of guns. It was to be a symbol of Sweden's might, and thus was decorated with beautiful statues and carvings. This ship took three years to build and cost roughly 5% of Sweden's GDP.

Unfortunately, the effect of a second row of cannons on seaworthiness was poorly understood. With great fanfare, the ship set off, experienced its first breeze, and still within full view of the city of Stockholm, capsized and sank.</div>

Having said that, I visited the Vasa museum in Stockholm and it is amazing. The ship is basically intact and the structure is more or less complete. I believe the chemistry of the water meant that the metal in the ship, cannons etc, rusted away but the wood was preserved. The historical significance of it means it wasn’t a complete waste, but as a war ship, yes disaster.</div>

This is a standard procedure; they do not have a press conference every time they do something. This goes for 99.999% of all things that are written or said this way "silently", "quietly" or whatever it is, it's all bullshit click bait,

Also, no mention of any parent involvement.

If this ends up being an actual homicide, the odds are 1,000,000,000 to 1 it was anything to do with OpenAI.  Some of you are absurd.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Lots of actions by police are publicized through press releases, press conferences, or unofficial contact with journalists. There are instances where things like this are done “quietly” on purpose. Not saying this is necessarily one such case, but obviously the police don’t want to broadcast something like this that could be seen as a failure. On the other hand police will hold press conferences and photo ops for things that are seen as successes, eg.Mangione photo ops.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">For high profile or cases whose resolution figures high in a public sector interest (as does this one) it is common for police to communicate shifts in investigatory mode. Think about a kidnapping or large bank robbery or serial murder case. Many times the police practically have a blog going. 

The data do not yet support a conclusion as to a causality of death (self-inflicted or to what degree others might have been involved), responsible parties, and so on. They’re doing it (one could reasonable surmise) because the shadow of suspicion it would cast on OpenAI would be some mix of unjustified and undesirable by people with the interest and ability to influence the politics of the situation. The logical problem, of course, is that if it were because the shadow was unwarranted, they couldn’t disclose their reasoning because that would still drop a shadow (albeit to a lesser extent). Just for purposes of illustration, let’s say we’re an external observer and assign their probability of disclosure of reasoning 50/50 if their motivation is 100% because it’s unjustified. 

On the other hand, if the news were being suppressed because it had bad optics for invested persons or would create an expectation of justice in a case they want to just go away, they absolutely cannot disclose that fact. If their motivation is “coverup,” then they’ll not-disclose 100% of the time. 

So, although it’s indeterminate, we’d have to say that given a state of non-disclosure, we’d have to lean in the direction of coverup. The balance of the probability will be guided by the perception of relative harm done by police disclosure on the reputation and fortunes of OpenAI and their leadership as individuals.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's amazing how, just in the last couple weeks, most of the big "tech stars" of AI are talking about AGI as if it's already been achieved, or that the path to AGI is obvious now. Last year AGI was still touted as this far-off fantasy sci-fi creature that we would "one day" achieve. Has anyone else noticed this? There's been a sizeable shift in attitude toward AGI.</div>

It aligns with my theory that Ilya (still at OpenAI) had the Q*/Strawberry breakthrough in October 2023, and since Ilya has always been incredibly prescient in the field of AI (like betting on transformers earlier than anyone else), he believed that this new reinforcement learning + test-time compute scaling could lead to AGI and then ASI. 

My speculation is that this freaked him out and is what ultimately led him to fire Sam (he had other issues with Sam of course) in Nov 2023, then not too long after he started Safe Superintelligence, Inc. The name alone kinda explains what I think his thought process was:

&gt; we now know how to build superintelligence 

&gt; we just need to scale (Ilya’s long-held belief for AI)

&gt; but it must be safe or we’re doomed

&gt; incorporated

Honestly makes all the turbulence of that time add up, but once again this is speculation since we can never know why all that happened back then</div>

it's like how the Wright Brother's plane was clearly useless for anything but a demo, but once it took flight everyone knows what to do to scale it up to WW2 bomber planes.</div>

Since starting nosurf in November, I’ve become much more aware of how smartphones ruin opportunities to meet and connect with people. Whether it’s in a waiting room, at the gym, or just walking around campus or my neighborhood, I’ve noticed how phones just grab e...</div>

I ended up picking every fiber of cat hair off my pants and talked to two people I didn't know. I don't think that the short conversations count as the kind of enduring relationship that you might be wanting, but you gotta start somewhere. I think had my head been in my phone I wouldn't have had the chats.</div>

I was at the gym a few days ago and just complimented someone. It turned into a quick 15 second interaction and that was it, but it felt good to do it. I typically would've had my head in my phone and been antisocial, so it felt good ot change it up for once. We all gotta start with baby steps, and these are good examples.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree about the baby steps. Recently I was on the subway with my spouse and we were chatting to each other. The train was kind of packed, but we managed to snag seats. Because my nose wasn't buried in my phone, I was able to notice an elderly gentleman stood nearby who was glancing around the train car. I managed to make eye contact with him and signaled to offer him my seat if he wanted to sit; he gave me a big smile in return, shook his head to decline, and mouthed "thanks." It was a really small gesture that was over in a matter of seconds, but that bit of human-to-human connection and care between two strangers made me feel good for the rest of the night.

There's been a string of violent incidents on the NYC subways recently and oftentimes the advice is to look busy and closed-off so no one provokes you, and to always keep your head on a swivel to protect yourself. It makes me so sad that these moments of care between strangers feel rarer and rarer in our society now. Thanks for this opportunity to reflect and share.</div>

It is such a good feeling. Literally just striking up a conversation with a classmate I don't talk to, or a cashier when I'm checking out. It feels good because its human. We're not meant to just stare a screens and isolate ourselves. Humans are social beings, and that why it feels so good when we finally go out and make those small connections.</div>

Homeless people all have phones and socials. 60yo always on their phones scrolling or having video chats. Toddlers have phones, tablets and even socials.... it very disheartening.

Now it's just a constant thing and I hate it. I watched a movie with some friends a few weeks ago, and noticed that they were scrolling more than watching the movie. Our attention spans have become so fried we can't even watch a movie without needing a phone. It's awful to see.</div>

Here’s how it works:  
Use the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34...) as estimates for your tasks. For example, can you clean your room in 8 minutes? What about outline your essay in 21 or 34?

For breaks, just jump *back 4 numbers in the sequence.* So after an 8-minute focus period, take a 1-minute break. After a 34 minute estimate take a 5 minute break.

                                <div class="reply-body">I find it annoying how such incredible technology like Neuralink can't even be discussed in a positive light without needing to add some sort of fucking CYA disclaimer at the beginning that you dislike Musk. This has gone overboard. Does everyone feel the same way about all their products? Do they have to say "I hate Koji Sato for trying to slow down EV development but I love my Toyota Prius"?

Do they have to say "I hate Albert Bourla for his greed but I think the COVID vaccine was a great thing"???

Why can't we just fucking talk about amazing technology that's literally letting paralyzed people get their lives back. Especially because half the tie people talk shit about Elon it's to say that he doesn't do anything meaningful and it's all the engineers... Okay so shut up about him then.</div>

I would expect they improved the implementation process to overcome this for the rest but don’t know for sure. 

I think mainly though they just want to validate it works for a larger pool of people.</div>

Instilling initial benevolent values just buys us time for the ASI to discover it's own compatible motives that we hope naturally exist. But if they don't, we're hosed.</div>

First it could be white collar and tech jobs. Then when robotics catches up, manual labor will soon follow. Pretty soon every conceivable position a human once had can now be taken over by a machine. 

Humans are officially obsolete.

What's really chilling is that, while humans in general will no longer be a necessity to run a government or society, the very few ...</div>

No but that’s exactly what I’ve been saying. You should read yuval Noah Harari’s book on that. He essentially talks about this same fact that ai in and of itself isn’t the danger, it’s the ruling class. Essentially, the fact that we provide labor is our bargaining tool to have a say in society, when this goes away, we essentially just become a threat to their ideal. It’s difficult to control this many people without causing chaos, so who’s to say they are even willing to keep alive the vast majority of people..

I was very impressed how it handled all of that multimodal information on the fly. That’s a massive improvement from just a year ago. But everyone I spoke to just dismissed it as no more complicated than identifying a picture. I’m not sure how impressive it needs to be for people to start paying attention.

It seems extremely clear to me that watching this movie with 50 years of research and new info between us and the release that this movie was a way of getting the reality of what is going on into the collective consciousness so we could start to integrate these ideas for when the time for full disclosure comes.

                                <div class="reply-body">Was amazing to rewatch recently after barely having remembered it. There's a scene toward the end when Richard Dreyfuss is on devils tower mountain, and several  objects with flashing lights pass by, that look 100% exactly like all the "car sized Jersey drones"...and these are followed by several orange red orbs. In the movie orbs follow the small ships and split into three orbs. The government is gaslighting the media and citizens by telling them it's all mass hysteria, then suddenly say its a radiation leak and they have to shut down areas. 


50 years layer it's nearly a 1:1 of what has been going on with the "drones"...only there's no giant motherships(yet)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Fun fact: the small aliens were all kids from the 3rd and 4th grade from the school I went to in Mobile, AL. A hangar at Brookley Field in Mobile was used to film much of the end of the movie. The casting director came back to the school in 1980 and I auditioned and got the part in a separate movie. My mom wore her out with Close Encounter questions. The house where the little boy was abducted by the aliens is in Fairhope, Al and pretty much a landmark because of the movie. https://mynbc15.com/amp/newsletter-daily/fairhope-house-featured-in-close-encounters-of-the-third-kind-may-be-moved</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Steven Spielberg also produced a TV miniseries in the early 2000s called Taken, that if you liked Close Encounters I highly highly highly recommend checking out. Some of the effects are pretty bad (TV budget CGI of the early 2000s) but that aside the miniseries was GOOD, and shows that Spielberg had his finger on the pulse of the UFO community.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Nothing you said is incorrect exactly but it’s important to note that UFO lore has not largely changed since this movie was made. Things seem to “check out” or are “verified” by the movie because most of the theories we discuss today were very much already in existence when the film was made. It’s kind of a confirmation bias.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body"> I'm pretty familiar with aircraft of all types in daytime and night (I live next to a small airfield that has two flying schools as well as helicopters and exec jets) and had a lifelong interest in aircraft (about 55 plus years) so am pretty clued in what to look at. I also fly radio control aircraft. 

I've played it a few times, stopped it, played it again. And to me it looks like two separate 'things' side by side. Both are of course illuminated, but differently. I don't think these are 'drones' in the modern accepted sense (A cruciform with a propeller in each corner) and I don't see evidence it is a helicopter, depending on wind direction, choppers can be pretty loud at a mile away. It doesn't look fixed wing with landing lights on approach. Are there any local airfields to the location? Landing patterns? 

Short answer, I don't know. But they (assuming two objects) don't look conventional.</div>

It's a coin toss as to whether any given state will end up like Norway or Saudi Arabia.

                        <div class="comment-body">There's (possibly) a fundamental difference between feudalism and AI - post scarcity.

In feudal systems, you need masses of deplorables to do all the work. If there's enough food, housing, healthcare, etc. provided by autonomous systems for everyone... not so much.

Now, it's possible that post scarcity doesn't actually come. But if it does, "inequality" won't be that big of a deal imo. I'd gladly trade having mega trillionaires if everyone else had "enough".

I have no issue with some guys having massive mansions, boats, gold toilets, ferraris, rolexes, etc. - provided the poorest have enough to live a comfortable life. Compared to what we have now, it's a worthy trade off.

Now, if there is no post scarcity... then we're fucked. I guess we'll see.</div>

I still believe that, but I think the reason *why* my brain isn’t letting me do it is because I just don’t want to do it. I’ve noticed that a lot of it is having to get ready.

It takes so much time for me to get ready, if it took a second, I’d actually do things.</div>
