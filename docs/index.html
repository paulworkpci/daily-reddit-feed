From the Delectation of Independence:
"... whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness." 


Time for us to declare independence from the country of Israel.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Just want to share my thoughts about the Kirk shooting and how it relates to Israel -

 I am convinced that this was an MAGA/israel hit. 
We need to look back at 9/11. The project for a new American century said that a “Pearl Harbor event” needs to take place in order for their strategy to be implemented without resistance. 9/11 happens and we see the propaganda machine immediately start blaming bin Laden and Americans are emotionally manipulated into hating Muslims. It works and we are led into two bogus wars, the patriot act, extraordinary rendition ect.. 
What that has to do with this is - Project 2025. It was highly controversial. MAGA had 4 years to think of how they could enact their plan. So prior to Kirk getting shot, he denied Israeli funding so his platform wouldn’t be controlled by them to push their narrative to help fix their reputation. Kirk also said he wanted the Epstein files to be released, which would be a huge blow to Trump and Israel if they are implicated in the files. So they murder Kirk. IMMEDIATELY, social media exploded with bots and propaganda, the astroturfing has been insane. As if it were pre packaged and ready to go. All the funky stuff surrounding the shooting, and the shooter himself. The bogus text exchange, 2 decoy suspects, a suspicious private jet, the weird writings on the bullets, the trans roommate. Trump and Vance IMMEDIATELY place blame on the left before the shooter is even caught. And look at how trumps admin is exploiting his death… they quickly strike down on free speech, designate antifa as a domestic terrorist group (which anyone can be labeled as antifa) he already has the national guard in cities, he is pressuring the FCC so they will go thru with the merger, so the right can consolidate a state media program type thing. Netanyahu IMMEDIATELY says that Israel did not kill him. 
This is literally the 9/11 playbook. Instead of emotionally manipulating the American people to hate Muslims, they have manipulated us into hating eachother. And while we are busy fighting eachother, they are quietly pushing through more project 2025. Laura Loomer even took to Twitter to say there is an Al Qaeda terrorist threat in America. 
This is obviously high speculative, but it all feels so sinister and well orchestrated. I am sure I am missing more coincidences, so if I did, please chime in or fact check me.

Edit to add things that have happened since the shooting: 

Senate voted against releasing the Epstein files. 
Voted to revoke American passports for all who criticize Israel.
Closed a deal for TikTok to be sold to Larry Ellison, the biggest doner to the “ friends of the IDF”
Congress voted to allow weapon shipments to Israel without congressional approval.

Ben Shapiro instantly stands up and tries to force his way as the person who will carry Kirk’s legacy.

Am I crazy to think this all gives credence to the idea that this heavily implicates Israel and the Neo cons for 9/11?</div>

Our tax dollars are being used to fund genocide and to pay for their foreign healthcare and college programs while Americans struggle with medical and student loan debt.

Any criticism or accusation of war crimes is met with the claim of antisemitism. They are using religion as a shield to protect themselves from accountability and the law.</div>

We’re arguing left or right, meanwhile our tax dollars are bankrolling Israel without a peep. It is sickening, it’s a disgrace, both Dems and Republicans are happily in on it. One of the biggest travesties of our time. 

I can’t believe it sometimes, people are like “I can’t believe lazy people in the U.S. want affordable health-care!” meanwhile we are literally funding universal health-care for the Israelis 🤣 Regardless of partisan affiliation you have to agree that’s *fucked.*</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly I think Grok is an under rated competitor. All the times I've used it, it's been great. Not everyone just relies on hardcore coding as a job replacement. I'd say that's a minority -- yet, they are catching up surprisingly well in that space. I still think Google will ultimately win out, and I understand "Elon Bad", but that dude always seems to pull off the impossible... No matter what he gets into he somehow either makes it work, or completely defy expectations.

Again, I get the partisan political brain rot where we're all supposed to chant how much we hate Elon to signal to our tribe. But I'll die on this hill... This dude is rich as fuck, knows how to build amazing teams, and looks at things from a weird autistic way and manages to find unique routes to success. SpaceX and Tesla, were never supposed to succeed as far richer and talented people before him have created graveyards. Twitter was insisted to fall apart within a few weeks, then months, then year... And now it's worth more than he paid for it. Even smaller projects like Boring which people consider "failures" aren't failures at all... They aren't unicorns like he envisioned, but they are profitable, still progressing forward, super liked in LV, and still making breakthroughs to the point it may become a huge success, albeit, far behind schedule. 

His secret to success has always been being able to build great teams because he is also deeply familiar with whatever project he's working on. This builds trust and allows flat hierarchies. Everyone who's worked with him at a higher level all say the same, "I wanted to work with him because he's not like other CEO's. This guy actually deeply understands everything so I know we're on the same high level and can really communicate ideas... Rather than deal with CEO's who are just ignorant CEOs focusing on fundraising." Couple that with his money mountain, and I think he's going to really pull through. Every iteration has been great IMO, but within the community it's always been a joke, yet every generation gets more and more impressive with less and less Elon Bad critics chiming in. The recent Grok release is seriously insanely good and blows me away with its performance. 

My money is on he's going to look for more fundamental breakthroughs and will become a direct competitor with Google... My money is on having so much compute that the teams will have enormous flexibility to experiment and innovate with little constraint. OpenAI will be casual normie platform who slowly gets gutted out, and Anthropic will be more of a specialist that eventually gets acquired. Meta is the only unknown at this point. No fucking clue what they are going to pull off, and are basically a complete wild card.

                                <div class="reply-body">It's not even a race anymore. Google has such an advantage in compute due to their homegrown TPU platform that they outproduce the entirety of Nvidia in total AI compute production. You just can't compete with that.

The outlier here is Anthropic because they have a focus on interpretability research so in theory they could make a suprise breakthrough that catapults them ahead.

It's kind of bizarre that the general public even thinks that OpenAI is still in the race.</div>

Which like,, Kirk was an activist who said it was necessary that ppl die by guns (he was referencing children in mass shootings) so ppl keep their guns. Then he died by a gun. 

I’m sure there’s horrible trolls on both sides but the majority of ppl said yeah dude died unnecessarily 

Now the maga movement is saying he was this great guy 
He’s not. He was a debate bro that talked about how we should face given Black ppl the right to vote. It’s just silly 
Died should have died through gun violence because no one should. 

So it’s just a false narrative but appeased ppl who don’t like to take sides</div>

Somewhere along the way, I got caught up in school, grades, and “serious” career paths. Years later, when I felt stuck, I went back to that same curiosity. 

I started building small projects again, and it reminded me who I actually am: someone happiest when I’m creating.

                        <div class="comment-body">When I was a kid I was an obsessive reader. Always had a book in my hands and often finished several a week. But after college and in my 30s, I realized that I wasn't reading much at all anymore. And the books that I started, I just couldn't get into and had trouble finishing.

So even though I felt silly, I went back to revisit old children's and YA books I'd loved when I was growing up. And it kick-started my love of reading again.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I can very much relate to your comment. I am 37 currently, and was ferocious reader as a child. Throughout my late teens and through college I didn’t read much. Maybe 1-4 books a year. Mainly easily digestible mystery books. 4 or 5 years ago I had the revelation that I was a reader as a child, and that must be important to who I am as a person. Should be noted that I have been trying to “find” my true self as I enter middle age. Ever since I have been reading nearly daily, trying to work through classics and my favored authors bibliographies .I have been enjoying my journey and plan to continue down the path of myself.</div>

There is nothing wrong with watching cartoons, reading comics, or children's books. Shaming yourself or others for doing so, now that would be rather silly.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That helped me as well. When I realized as an adult (25ish) that I hadn't picked up a book in years after the Hunger Games trilogy finished, I went to a bookstore and grabbed a few of the "bestsellers" and attempted them. They were absolutely not my cup of tea.

Went to the library instead, back to the teen horror section that I loved in my youth, and breezed through the 10 books I checked out. I finish at least a book a week now, though it's generally an ebook on my phone.</div>

Seeing how some adults are with things like MTG, or especially Pokemon cards definitely indicates their inner child is dead dead.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">And he is going after Lisa Cook, a federal board of reserve member, for a none existent mortgage fraud.       

Turned out there was no mortgage fraud and Cook had disclosed all information, so now Trump is going after the prosecutor and trying to get him fired so he can put someone else there go after Cook again.       

Conservatives for years cried about DOJ being political. Yet instead of making any effort to stand up against that, they are cheering for Trump to take it to the next level.       

Somehow Ben Shapiro, Candice Owens and Tucker Carlson are the only conservatives smart enough to realize this can easily backfire next time a democrat is in charge.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The Emiratis bought $2 billion in the Trump family's stable coin this summer on the crypto exchange thats owned by Trump and Steve Witkoff, his Middle East and  Russia envoy . Surprisingly at the sand time Trump fired the person in charge of enforcing the export controls of Nvidia's high end chips and the replacement Trump picked signed a deal granting the Emirates access to Nvidia's most cutting edge equipment for their AI center.

The Trump family must be so happy they were able to profit off Donald's political position. The US's geopolitical interests are now basically whatever is best for the Trumps' businesses

Ours Puny error prone human intelligence was able to accomplish it with narrow domain specific machine intelligence now the stakes are higher because we are actively creating superintelligence of more general types that can see evaluate infer apply patterns we wont be able to not in a million years, So doomer narratives prevail possibly foremostly from poor handling of previous narrow AIs, that is, social media that lead to massive damages to psychosocial aspects. Some of the lighter Doomer predicts are becoming true like AI psychosis and this is only the beginning.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The whole "kill the poor" fantasy is bizarre. One time an European noble became well known to be brutal to his serfs who rebel, but his own friends reminded him that "if you run out of serfs, you would no longer qualify as a Noble".

There is really nothing stopping the wealthy from murdering the poors NOW. But that cost resources and time and it doesn't really benefit them. The only thing that cause suffering is the extraction of resources and manpower from the poor to benefit the rich. But the logic failure is to somehow think it is a BAD thing that the rich people don't need to steal from the poor anymore after robotics.

After automation there would be no need to exploit the poor. By definition that means there is more for the poor. There is no logic to jump to "time to kill everyone poor and turn the world into a zombie apocalypse for the wealthy, intentionally".

Even the former CEO of UnitedHealthcare, evil as he is, wouldn't kill people for nothing. He wouldn't work for free.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The logic failure here is that nobles needed serfs for farming, and the rich today need the poor for labor.  If the owners of capital no longer need the poor, they don't need to exploit them but they also don't need them at all.  They probably wouldn't deliberately murder them but they also wouldn't share the wealth with them.  You're positing "now we'll finally get our fair share" at the exact point where they have no need to keep us happy at all.  

More simply--if capital owns the AI and the robots, there will not be "more for the poor."  There will be more for capital.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Serfs provided labor to nobles. We will provide nothing but unrest and a burden on resources. It’s pretty easy to understand. You dont kill the poor until they start rebelling or challenging your ability to do whatever tf you want. Look at Gaza. If theyd simply been good subjects, let themselves be caged, surveilled and deprived of all resources/ economic access then israel wouldn’t have mass murdered them</div>

Humanity has never been more fucked, laughing at out faces, mocking us with stunts like this while most of us struggle. It's enough to make your blood boil.

If this were my government, I would probably do nothing about it and complain online but still, I would be upset. Moreover, I'm upset at the billions of masses who gives attention to such stunts, they have no understanding of reality.

The vast majority of humanity is living in slavery, but sometimes I think that's a good thing, because I look at the slaves around me and I think "What would they do if they had freedom?" and the answer is probably nothing of significance,</div>

[More Was Possible: A Review of If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/11/iabied)

Yudkowsky's core argument that AI will likely go FOOM in a matter of seconds or hours was predicated on hand-crafted solutions if you read his early work on AI safety, it really does not line up with how contemporary AI works.

The AI 2027 scenario is a lot more plausible given the systems we're building, and that take-off speed still gives us a lot of time (measured in months) before something dangerous comes online. It's still a very dangerous situation, mind you, but it gives us plenty of time to react and assess. The real question is whether we'll make the right choices during that critical period.</div>

The authors repeatedly add factors that maximize the difficulty and minimize the capabilities of the AI for the sake of argument. The AI is barely smarter than a human, if at all, until long after the point humans have lost control of the situation. It merely thinks much faster (which I hope isn't something I have to explain is realistic). It is explicitly limited by the authors to attacking in predictable and understood ways just so naysayers can't pretend an AI couldn'tsoon be smart enough to be dangerous. A major point was that we aren't prepared to defend against attacks from an AI even in the exceedingly unlikely event that it couldn't think of new and unexpected ways to attack us.</div>

The thing about Yudkowsky's work is that it was created when we had no idea how these sytems would look. The awareness he brought to the topic is very valuable, which a lot of the Effective Altruism &amp; adjacent spaces being very aware of the topic. We don't have as much time raising the awareness when we get to the critical time window.</div>

That's not what's outlined in the book.

https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1968810334942089566

&gt;Appears to be arguing with an old remembered position rather than noticing the actual book's arguments.  We explicitly don't rest on FOOM, likely or not.  We show a concrete story about an AGI which doesn't think it can solve its own alignment problem and doesn't build other AIs.</div>

A 3-digit IQ human, by definition, cannot control a 1000-digit IQ entity. And this goes way beyond the issue of alignment. An ant cannot comprehend the reasoning of a human. A human can manipulate an ant in ways it cannot even wrap its head around. It's simply a matter of power asymmetry.

Predictability of ASI is impossible...</div>

Unless you're coding in assembly, you're literally depending on so many fucking tools in the back end, that this argument is kind of meaningless.

From the top (engine), you're letting a computer turn diagrams and other functions into a programming language, using someone else's libraries, then the programming language into assembly, then assembly into binary, all of those things, that you didn't even have to think about.

If you can architecture, and understand what the AI is giving you, you can code.</div>

It depends what the argument is? If the argument is that people who code the old way, without AI, are exercising their brains more, then OP is absolutely correct.

If all you're doing is using LLMs to code and then going home and watching TikToks then your brain will rot. People should understand that.

As software developers, development alone used to keep our brains healthy, that's no longer the case. 

Crazy how many things that are healthy for the brain are being taken away from people without a single fight.</div>

I just use a ChatGPT Pro Plan, and I don't really want to spend more on API keys to use other services, for now.

I tend to use Local development with Agent (full access) and gpt-5-codex high for my development.

This is being done on Windows 11.

                        <div class="comment-body">Well I don’t have any 20 year old PHP code, but I have recently had it working on some old VB 6 code for a customer that refuses to join the modern world.  

I just give it detailed prompts.  If I have logs or things, I add an extra file into the folder and make sure my prompt includes the file and what’s in it.  I tell it what I have checked and everything I can.  It doesn’t always find the issue, but it’s generally pretty good.  If that doesn’t work and you can put it in a GitHub repository, then use the online codex and make sure you give the environment web access and sometimes that helps.  

I did have 1 bug this morning where codex found the bug, but couldn’t seem to get a good fix, so I copied the code to pro and had it take a look and pro found and fixed the bug.

In the end though it will generally come down to you just digging.

Also sometimes if you can’t specifically reproduce the bug, just asking it to review zxy code to see if it can offer any improvements is a good thing.

Last week it found a bug in some 4 year old code that nobody had caught.  Thankfully it was in the handling of archive data, but we wouldn’t have noticed it until it was too late.  Now at least the code is fixed and archives are correct going forward.</div>

Make sure the relevant files are open or included in your workspace so it can access them. When you ask for help, describe the project structure and what you are trying to build instead of just pasting snippets. I usually start with a high level description, let it suggest an approach, then ask follow up questions to refine things. Also take advantage of iterative debugging features; ask it to explain why it chose a certain solution or how it would test the result. You might also try enabling the web access or GitHub integration if you can, since extra context improves the responses.</div>

I'm skeptical of those because LLMs tend to hallucinate and evaluating fitness on helpfulness and comprehensiveness sounds weak to me. I don't understand what the unique selling point of this approach is. Appears to be agentic LRM, RAG, tools, and extra steps. I have to take my time reading the paper, but obviously if you have lots of building blocks and iterate at Google scale, you might build something decent eventually. How do you actually get the guesswork and trial and error out of process as much as possible? You need something like blueprints/outline instead of a probabilistic slop.

What really moves the needle is tying your work to dollars and impact. For example: Instead of “I’ve been here three years,” say “Since I took over inventory, shrink dropped by 18%, which saved us around $40K.” Instead of “I work really hard,” say “The project I led landed a cli...</div>

And then they have to pay 20% of my salary with them in recruiters fees, plus all the time cost of interviewing and onboarding 😂</div>

But I don't get what's supposed to be dystopian about this. It's a business transaction, you're selling your time and effort for money and it makes perfect sense that you argue for a raise based on the value you provide for the employer's investment.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean... To be fair... It's not possible to quantify work in any other way... You don't deserve more money because you worked at a place for three years, but you deserve more money because you worked at a place for three years and contributed to it's growth. That's what OP is trying to say too, it's the exact same thing but we should have the ability to phrase it better. I do agree that this is already a dystopian world, this example just ain't it though.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Your symptom is a common experience of a post-trauma reaction. A mental or emotional numbness, concentration and/or attention difficulties, avoidance of emotions and calm mental space (which may no longer feel safe), an uptick in negative feelings, including anxiety which can be subtle and not at the level of panic are all common. The fullest expression of a post trauma reaction is PTSD which I should add presents in myriad ways and not always as obviously as one might think. But you can think of it as a continuum and just because you might not meet the criteria for PTSD doesn’t mean that there aren’t symptoms or reaction that need some attention. 

I’m a clinical psychologist so dm me if you want some more specific info but the overall suggestion is to see a therapist, preferably a psychologist, and one who has a good amount of experience treating trauma (not all do).</div>

A workaround is to run the model locally so you are not tied to the online service. There's an open source CLI tool at [https://github.com/just-every/code](https://github.com/just-every/code) that lets you run AI agents against your codebase from the command line. Running it locally keeps control in your hands and helps avoid API limits.</div>

It has a preference to solve those tasks programmatically (using Python scripts) instead of actually using it‘s LLM powers to really read each file, even though that is absolutely necessary for the task. It helps to instruct: „Do this MANUALLY for each file, don‘t write code to perform this task.“

If your task toes not require coding at all, better chose a none Codex model obviously, which is available in the CLI too.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">At slightly less than 5500lbs, it’s just 2% heavier than the Lucid Air Sapphire.

So just par for the course for these EVs.

What’s impressive is that this trim is just *5kg* heavier than the lower trim that has “only” 1200hp.

With ICE the fuel is power dense but the motor is inefficient, complex and heavy, but with EVs it’s the opposite. Imagine the changes you need to do to make an ICE car to go from 1200hp to 3000hp.

&gt; We now know a few more details about the car too. It gets 2,978bhp, over double the ‘regular’ car’s 1,288bhp, from four electric motors (which utilise the world’s thinnest super-silicon steel – 0.1mm – in mass production), each of which can spin at up to 30,000rpm.

&gt;Heat generation is also reduced by up to 67 per cent compared to the 800V platform at matching power outputs.

That claim on heat reduction has tremendous impact in motorsport uses.</div>

I don’t really see industry insiders dismissing Chinese EVs at all, from journalists to auto executives the reaction has been pretty universally impressed, amazed and if not outright alarmed by the pace of Chinese EV progress.

All the Toyota engineers I’ve talked to in Aichi would tell me they are both impressed and terrified by how far ahead China is in almost *every* area these days. 

If anything it’s the general public who have a tough time coming to term with fact that China in 2025 is an entirely different country than China in 2005. Almost no westerners have seen their country progress as much in their lifetime as the Chinese did in the last 30 years, and when you combine it with the terribly biased media and government propaganda, you end up with everyone believing a nation that builds and sells cheap stuff on Temu can *only* build cheap stuff that sells on Temu.


Then reality slowly hits and we now have cognitive dissonances.

One of my favorite things is hearing reactions from Americans who have traveled to China recently for the first time, especially for *business*. It’s pretty much universally some variation of “holy fuck we’ve been lied to we are soooo cooked”.</div>
