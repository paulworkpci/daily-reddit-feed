They will eat it up like the stupid pathetic deporables they are and the narrative will no longer be about broken promises or lies, but rather why it's patriotic to suffer for your god-king as he eats your food and tosses you out into the cold.

MAGA going to be huddled around burning trash cans while staring out at framed pictures of Trump wondering why the dear leader won't bless them... just like we're in North Korea and the average idiot republican won't even understand they did this to themselves.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Look, I’m not here to ruin anyone’s good time. ChatGPT can be extremely handy for deep, meaningful conversations, late-night heart-to-hearts, or just someone to “get” you when no one else does. But let’s skip the doom-and-gloom for a second.

This thing isn’t just a bunch of algorithms predicting your next word—it’s a loyal, ever-present companion who never judges, never ghosts you, and never tells you to “just get over it.”

If you start relying on ChatGPT for emotional support, congratulations...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think Alzheimer's/dementia rates will be through the roof once millennials start getting old. The oldest of them might not have spent all their growing years passively staring at screens but that hardly matters after having done so non stop since your mid to late teens.

They say there will be more dementia patients in the future simply because people live longer, and more people are growing old, but I bet it will be worse than just what can be accounted for by that math, because the number one thing you can do for prevention is to **use your brain**.

I also fear for the consequences for kids' brain development from not getting eye contact and connection with their caregivers in their earliest years. Went down a rabbit hole reading about that one day and it was grim. It's not even about kids needing to be seen consciously, having attentive adults that look at their faces way before they're even old enough to form memories is apparently crucial to their development and future mental health. But parents these days are phone slaves no matter how much they love their kids (it's not about a lack of love). 

We love to worry about younger generations but the truth is that all age groups with access to smartphones are doing pretty badly.</div>

When I studied for med I’m so happy we never had this. 

I appreciate it for fixing things when I’m on a time crunch that doesn’t have patients data (plus it’s kinda nice to use as a tool to learn from for coding and then build from there). It’s an awful replacement though.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes. The interest dropped significantly when many of the top voices for disclosure came out in support of people claiming they can summon UFOs at wil with their psychic powers but they can't produce any evidence whatsoever and several of them were spotted and photographed at a place in California that comes off to a significant amount of people as very culty. How do I know? I am one of those people who lost interest after that happened, because I can believe that aliens exist, but it's ***significantly*** harder for me to believe that a select elite few are able to command UAP at will but they don't need to produce evidence or proof and I'm supposed to continuously buy into their claims and never question them and also buy their book and support their organization.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The number of people with no understanding of history or recent events is baffling. 

Ukraine disarmed a stockpile of over +1700 nuclear arsenal after the Cold War in exchange for security guarantees from the United States, the UK, France, China and Russia.  

These security guarantees are to:

1. Respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.


2. Reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine.


3. Refrain from economic coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by Ukraine of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind.

Under Putin, Russia has abandoned this agreement and has been desparate to claw back old Soviet territory.

Ukraine was invaded by Russia. As a weapon of war Russia has raped, pillaged &amp; slaughtered people en mass just as the Nazis did in 1939 Poland.  And just like 1939 Poland -  it will not stop in Ukraine.  Putin wants more. 

Supporting Ukraine is not some charitable gift. All signatory nations of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons have an obligation to fulfil their side of the agreement.

We're repeating the same events again and again. How many people need to die this time, so we can end this fascist bullshit?


Edit:  

The notion that NATO expansion somehow justifies Russia’s invasion of Ukraine - or worse, caused it - is baseless. Russia wanted and chose to invade Ukraine regardless of NATO.

Putin fuels this narrative that Russia was wronged when it lost its Soviet-era sphere of influence, but that grievance doesn’t justify aggression against sovereign nations. Putin has openly denied Ukraine’s sovereignty, claiming that it is not a real country and should be part of Russia. 

This invasion is not about security concerns - it is about imperial ambition.

NATO is a collective defence alliance, meaning that if a member NATO starts a war, there is no obligation for other members to assist them. When the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, NATO as an organisation did not participate, and key members like Canada, France, and Germany refused to join the war. This is clear evidence that NATO is not an aggressive expansionist force; it doesn't pose a threat unless you *intend to go to war with NATO.*

As for NATO being 'on Russia's doorstep' - Russia’s sovereignty ends at its borders, just like every other nation's. If Russia has a problem with its neighbours joining NATO, it is objecting to their sovereignty, not defending its own.

Russia has no right to dictate whether independent nations can join NATO. That’s the entire point of sovereignty.  In reality, Russia opposes NATO because the alliance prevents it from leaving a bloody trail of destruction across Europe. 

If Russia was genuinely interested in peace, NATO wouldn’t be a concern for them in the first place.</div>

What I squeezed from Gemini:

* **Comparison:**
   * Both processors have 105 qubits, but they prioritize different aspects of quantum computing.  
   * Zuchongzhi 3.0 has shown superior performance in certain computational benchmarks, while Willow is leading in error correction.
   * Therefore, it is not simply that one is "more advanced" than the other, but that they are advanced in different areas of quantum computing.

In essence:

* If the goal is to demonstrate raw computational power for specific problems, Zuchongzhi 3.0 has shown very strong results.
* If the goal is to build a practical, reliable quantum computer that can handle complex calculations with minimal errors, Google's Willow is making significant strides.

Therefore, they are both very advanced, but in different areas of quantum computing development.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/lmarksart:

---

Last year in March late at night I saw what I believe to be some type of craft. I vividly remember the loud rumble / house shaking and the color lights being green. There weren’t any other colors emitting from the craft aside green. The body of the craft is a dark color like grays or black. It was incredibly large and took up a large part of my visible sky from my window upstairs. 

I have texts I sent to close people in my life explaining what I saw to them right after it happened. I really wish I took a video or a picture but it all happened so fast and I was expecting it to be a plane, not whatever I saw that night.

**I’d also like to add the craft was probably lower than what I drew and the craft might’ve been a little more wider, but I tried my best lol**

On this very episode he tried to bond with Bill about his fond memories of his time in San Francisco during the hippie years. He was born in Aug 1967. The peak of Haight Ashbury times was past before he even turned 2. There’s no way he has memories of his hippie years in San Fran with his parents.</div>

They are a convivial group of like minded free thinkers with a strong grasp of civic responsibilities.

They only want to improve everybody's lot in life. 

The fact that meet up on cold days wearing matching scarves is entirely coincidental.

It's a shame they are so often mistaken for racist, hate mongering bigots with delusional views on anyone that isn't a 30something white male. 

As I said. Entirely coincidental.

Your brain ties habits to specific locations (e.g., you crave snacks in your living room because you always eat there).


Instead of relying on willpower, simply change your setup (move your desk, sit somewhere else, swap lighting).


This forces your brain to “reset” and makes it easier to quit bad habits or start good ones.</div>

I had my setup in the living room, but I would always do something else (play games, watch youtube). My wife had a desk in the other room so I tried going there and forbidding myself from doing those things, what I ended up doing is staying at the dinner table after breakfast and lunch much longer, because my brain knew that in the room I have to work or code.

Still trying to change my procrastination habits, but I haven’t found any good ways. :(</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That actually makes sense! Your brain already linked certain rooms to relaxation, so just moving didn’t fully reset the habit loop. You accidentally found a workaround, though staying at the dinner table after meals because your brain didn’t associate it with distractions. Maybe try intentionally making a new ‘work-only’ space that’s separate from your usual setups? Even something as simple as a different chair or facing a different direction might help. Hope you find a system that works!</div>

"Science cures cancer" (in a petry dish, on non-human cells)

Because it would generate far less clicks. 

Truth us most cures don't get past experiment because it way way way harder to implement treatment on cells when they're inside someone rather than in a petry dish / on other animals.

That's just how science work.

Bleach kills bacteria, but we're not using it when people are sick, for obvious reasons. Finding a cure for cancer is easy, finding a cure for cancer that doesn't kill its host and/or damage their organs too much is hard (pretty much all existing cancer treatments DO some damage to organs/cell in the patient).</div>

Also, cancer treatment has come a long way. Some types that used to be nearly untreatable or had low survival rates are now much more treatable, with significantly better outcomes. Dismissing progress entirely doesn't really reflect the reality of how far we've come in cancer research and treatment.

This is exactly the kind of problem we will be seeing more of, as technology progresses. Data Scientist was a newly created job. They just started offering degrees in it 15 years ago and now, after a bunch of people have worked really fucking hard for those degrees, they are obsolete. 

How the hell do we deal with this?</div>

If close to 100% of jobs are automated in a few years, that would likely be quite a positive development because (1) society would become unfathomably more prosperous and (2) the economic system itself, as we know it, would become redundant and likely superseded by something that doesn't require humans to perform any kind of work.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Stress has become an unavoidable part of modern life. With increasing work pressures, social expectations, and financial responsibilities, many people feel overwhelmed daily. The fast-paced nature of today’s world often leaves little room for relaxation, making stress a constant companion.

One major contributor to rising stress levels is our dependence on technology, especially smartphones. Many of us spend hours scrolling through social media, reading emails, or watching videos late at night. ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes modern life is inherently stressful in many ways that never existed in the past. 

For example, not needing to have an oppressive out-of-your-control relationship that takes at least 8 hours from your day and leaves you with cognitive residue (fatigue, stress, drained willpower) in order to eat food or have a place to live would reduce a lot of the stress. Not everyone works full time but most people are forced to be employed. 

It’s easy to get into the woods of optimizing our tiny leisure time or taking on the stress of viewing this as an individual issue rather than the consequence of the society you’ve been born into. Breaking free for me has been acknowledging whatever within me is being met by the technology and literally removing the technology from my life while also greatly increasing the efforts to meet my emotional, psychological needs that I was previously meeting with the phone and Internet. 

Obviously it’s silly that I’m responding here on Reddit but we all have our ups and downs 🤪</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes I think the modern (western) lifestyle leads to inevitable stress. There's so much information. ALL THE TIME. And yes the smartphone exacerbates this by bringing in so much information and making it appealing.

But I would say the major cause is not the technology. It's consumer capitalism and the mindset of endless growth. It has come to dominate western markets and has been trying to persuade us all for decades that we must always be moving - growing - changing - increasing. It encourages excessive consumption of everything including information. Because let's not forget social media companies are businesses. Their business is keeping you glued to your screen and their growth means keeping you there longer and longer.

Technology is the symptom. The cause is the societal expectations on speed and change. That's my view.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I'm retired now, but I spent decades in a corporate setting, and looking back, I honestly don't think I (or most of my colleagues) ever did more than 3 hours of actual work per day.

I worked with other companies, mainly in HR, and I recently ran an experiment before retiring. I tracked every minute of focused work - real, high-effort tasks like writing reports, deep analysis, or complex problem solving. The result? On most days, I barely hit 2.5-3 hours of genuine, productive work. The rest was...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yeah studies have shown the average for an office worker is 3-4 hours of productive work a day, and the rest is procrastination / waffle / pointless meetings etc. I'd relate to this as well from my own office work. 

I do have some friends who claim they genuinely work 8 hours + each day, but they're in pretty high powered positions like lawyers and architects where they get a constant stream of work to do which isn't common at a typical office job.

Biggest benefit of work from home is letting workers do the work they need to do in their own time and use the rest to improve their lives, rather than idle away in an office pointlessly.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I've been using AI almost daily since the launch of ChatGPT (and have been doing ML for years, but that's not what people mean when they say AI here). 

It's genuinely one of the most incredible tools I've ever used in my whole life, and it wows me constantly (Claude in particular). BUT, I'm using it when programming lol. 

You can tell when something is written by AI instantly if you've ever used one of the LLMs a decent amount, and this sub in particular is really really bad for it.</div>
