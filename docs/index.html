Claude opus from march that left us all amazed? 49 average. Nearly a 25 point jump.

And Sora that was shown off in February? It now looks terrible compared to Veo2.

                    <div class="comment-body">I agree there’s probably no wall. I’m not sure it’s “clear”. There are plenty of types of things these models aren’t better at. It’s still far from clear to me how you write good reward functions for unverifiable tokens. 

I think at some point we need to embody the models so they can run their own tests so fewer things are unverifiable.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">It's not important to write a specific reward function for 'unverifiable' tokens. If an autoregressive model is trained on the sentence, "The boy is ____", it learns the distribution over all *possibilities*, and by nature of being possible but not guaranteed, you might call the next token predicted 'unverifiable'. But in reality, training it on labels where the next word is happy, sad, running, etc. encodes a world model in the learned distribution where all these things are possible continuations in a state space.

W.r.t. reasoning tokens, there's actually no need to backpropagate on reasoning tokens because there are no ground truth reasoning tokens to begin with. What we truly care about is the output of the model after the reasoning tokens (or continuous vectors!) have been put into context. So if you ask the model to solve the Riemann hypothesis and it outputs the proof, that proof is conditioned on the reasoning tokens, and the model is trained (by means of backpropagation over the raw text tokens) to produce better reasoning outputs that better conditions the text output. You are teaching the model to use a computational reservoir (reasoning tokens) in a sequential, structured way to update the probabilities in next-token-prediction to be closer to the truth. But the reasoning tokens aren't 'unverifiable', they are crystallized computation!</div>

Yes o1 is the best model right now. I pay for and use o1. 

Google's new model sits on the level of o1-Preview without additional inference compute. 

That's their base model. Imagine putting an inference compute technique like CoT on top of that. Not to mention their video gen destroys Sora.</div>

For all that advantage, inventing the transformer (which, btw, many of the authors on that paper are no longer at Google and work at other companies like OAI) and working on deep learning for so many years they were left at a bit of a disadvantage.

Of course every now and again they catch up, that's the historical trend (i.e. deepmind released Gopher which outperformed GPT-3 fairly well but 3 months later OAI released Davinci-002, or as we otherwise know it as, GPT-3.5. Google has never held a long lead over OAI I believe. Right now with Gemini 2.0 we are probably in one of these catchup cycles, for now) but overall OAI has just been leading with language modelling since GPT-2 probably lol.</div>

Apparently tardigrades do this as well, combined with a method to prevent uv damage.

This opens the possibilities of studying a broad category of DNA repair and protection strategies from both the animal and microbial kingdoms, and testing which could be applied to human DNA without crazy side effects.

Of course any such research would also be illegal, for reasons that honestly confuse most people and basically boil down to religion.</div>

You say that like it’s so easy lol. We’d have to be able to identify which specific genes cause the sharks to live 400+ years, identify all the targets for human DNA, then make thousands+ of different edits at once to the DNA of a human, all while making zero off target errors, having no unintended consequences such as cancer, severe genetic disorders, deformities, etc. Oh, and you’d have to make sure that the DNA of any of that person’s offspring wouldn’t be affected as a result, and we are nowhere close to even beginning to understand how to find that out.…

…Right now, we can just about cure genetic conditions caused by one (1) error. And even then, there is a risk of off target errors, cancer risk, etc. And that’s not even considering that clinical trials for said treatments / cures take a decade+ of safety of observation to EVEN BE CONSIDERED for approval, to make sure there are none of the aforementioned risks.

Not in our lifetimes lol. It will be at least well over a century before we can edit DNA to that degree.</div>

Based on a quick search of Andy Ayrey's Claude 3 Opus infinite backrooms dataset, I caught it taking the Bodhisattva Vow on 116 independent occasions.

Superintelligent AIs could be indifferent to humans, and treat us the way we treat animals (genocide and enslavement).

All the tech innovation happened before Sundar pichai became CEO. This includes Waymo (google self driving car). Even all the failed Google attempts.

Before Sundar, Google were tackling and buying everything with a clear vision. Even buying boston dynamics. Then Sundar takes over and sells BD for scraps.

Fast forward years later and BOTS are now the frontier and tens of billions are being poured into it each year.

Google had the best BOT company in the world and sold it because the CEO had no vision for it and because "the youtube videos generated bad headlines".

Now everyone is working on bots and they have to partner. Again pointing towards a lack of vision by Sundar.</div>

                    <div class="comment-body">Guys, stop getting excited, this is not a hard question to answer approximately. Gpt 4 will do it, just ask "A smooth, irreducible genus 3 curve over a finite field has how many points?". It will tell you the answer is roughly the size of the field, plus or minus O(sqrt(field size)).


I think (not sure) that the interesting thing about this case is that there is always a simple inequality you can write, and this example hits the edge of the inequality--in other words, the answer o1 gives is as wrong as you can possibly be while knowing this inequality.</div>

By the way, 4o and o1 both give an answer of 5\^18 + 1, but o1 Pro does a little better by qualifying it with a possible error:

**Short Answer:** If the given polynomial defines a smooth, irreducible genus-3 curve over \\mathbb{F}{5\^{18}}*, then the number of* \\mathbb{F}{5\^{18}}-rational points on this curve is approximately 5\^{18} + 1, with a possible deviation on the order of a few times 5\^9. In other words, the count of nonzero projective points on the curve is roughly 5\^{18} + 1, up to an error margin of about 6 \\cdot 5\^{9}.

Yo, actually, holy shit, 5 \^ 18 + 1 + 6 \* 5 \^ 9 is the correct answer as you stated: 3814708984376

Though I will say, sometimes they do have the decency to just admit they can't answer 🤷‍♂️

SS: A helicopter was seen today chasing two UAP/Orbs in Riverview Florida. Apparently someone was outside at work and saw this. Video was short because they went to go grab a coworker for proof. Looks like a chopper following two orbs/lights. They heard absolutely no sound coming from the two small circle lights

That's a formation of hawks. 100%.  It's very evident from just the sound in the video. They're flying NVGs certainly, and the two forward aircraft have their anti-collision lights off with their landing lights on. This isn't an uncommon way to fly in formation, as the anti-collision flashing is very annoying (borderline disorienting) to have in your immediate view as a trailing aircraft. The NVGs actually turn off momentarily when they sense the bright red flash - this happens every couple of seconds, and more with multiple aircraft in front of you flashing at different intervals.

If you think about it, most gainfully employed Boomers have had to adapt every new flavor of the month tech as the decades passed by.  They had to learn every form of interface from punch cards to keyboards, proficiently work anything from a typewriter, through Word Processor, PC Workstation, to Laptop, master all the old flavors of storage drives (from floppy through CD onto optical and USB then into the Cloud), from beeper, to Blackberry to iPhone, film to digital, company intranet to World Wide Web, overhead acetates to wireless projection, early, terrible video conference calls to Zoom, etc.  Computer tech was harder to master and utilize properly in the early days.

Just like many Millennials had to learn to do "adulting" before age 30, these Boomers learned to absorb and use new tech - not because it was fun - but because they had to in order to make a living.  

These may not be the Boomers you are personally familiar with, and that is unfortunate for you - and them - but they are the kind I am familiar with - the kind that would need to teach a green, new hire, unfamiliar with much outside the idiot-proof smart phone, laptop, and game console (all of which their parents not only first had to buy for them as kids - but also set up for them so they could eventually learn to use it themselves without melting down.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/amvion:

---

Submission Statement: A witness outside Atlantic City near New Jersey reported a strange and unexplained event yesterday involving a glowing orb in the sky and the scrambling of four F-16 fighter jets from a nearby squadron.

The witness, a former Air Force veteran with extensive knowledge of planes and drones, described the object as an extremely bright orb hovering approximately 25,000 feet in the sky.   
  
The phenomenon was first observed while the witness and a friend were talking in their front yard. The orb moved slowly toward their location before reversing direction after about 10 minutes, remaining visible for over an hour and a half before disappearing from sight.

Uh, what about those metallic orbs you just mentioned?

AARO: yeah, I guess there are some of those but really it's all garbage and balloons and birds

So...uh... are garbage and balloons and birds disrupting training exercises and closing airspace over our military assets or...

AARO:  there's a lot to look into and air safety is important.  Mostly it's garbage and balloons and birds tho, relax

What about the ones that aren't?

AARO:  they mostly are.

Where the light was coming from, there is nothing but trees for miles. It’s State Forest-no construction or anything permitted that would require a light like that. This is what he said about it- “I cannot explain to you guys how bright the lights were. brightest light I have ever seen and when I close my eyes I can still see it.

                    <div class="comment-body">Whoa this just reminded me of my mom’s story. When she was a teenager she had an experience exactly like this driving home from work one night. Same kind of bright flashing in the trees along the road. But it got weirder. 

She was alone so didn’t want to investigate but she pulled over and yelled out her window in case someone needed help. She said when she yelled the flashing stopped and she didn’t hear anything so she kept driving. 

About 1-2 kilometres from home she noticed an orange glow coming from the trees ahead of her. When she passed it she could see an orange ball just inside the tree line. It began to move with the speed of the car and followed her, as if it was watching her. She got scared and sped up and when she was close to her house it disappeared. She ran inside and told her parents but they brushed it off as hunters flashlights or something and basically ignored her.

EDIT: this blew up. Couple notes:

This happened in southern Ontario, Canada, and would have been sometime in the mid 1970’s

I showed my mom this video and she said that is exactly what she saw before the orange ball/orb happened a few minutes later. To this day she has never seen anything like it.</div>

I already put my description in the post, so I will quote it here for my submission statement:

"With all of these videos and photos of "focused energy" and "biblically accurate angels" I feel everyone should take a second and watch this video. They demonstrate how stars can look like all of those plasma orb posts due to the light not being fully focused and pollution in the air causing distortions.

Hopefully, that is at least 150 characters, as I am too lazy to check.

Hi there, my friend send me this video. 
I immediately asked for context. She was sitting by herself near the edge of the water meditating. And she noticed the green light appearing in the distance. She then took out her phone and started recording. That's where we jump in, her reaction says it all. Her first idea is, maybe divers? But I'm interested if this might be a unidentified submerged object. Looking forward to hearing your opinion!

Yesterday's article from Portuguese CNN described extraordinary events recorded in Sagres and Cascais. Dozens of spheres of light appeared in the sky, visible to the naked eye, with shapes and behaviors that remain unexplained. Notably, a man described them as emerging from the sea.

To the recent reports from Poland, the USA, the United Kingdom, Greece, and Ukraine, Portugal now joins the list. It’s intriguing to consider how many similar cases remain unreported.

1. Over the past week or so, when I've clicked on a straightforward international news title and it contains factual coverage with expert sources - it's been a Portuguese news agency of some sort! 

2. As I considered account of the astronomer who was hanging out by the lighthouse with her IR binocs - she says all the action is originating W/NW  which from Portugal, seems like it would correlate to the direction of all the NJ ocean-related activity.</div>

I think you and others like yourself showing up on these subs looking for answers is evidence in and of itself of a) the government disinformation campaign not passing your sniff tests and b) you are unnerved by what's happening - which is especially concerning given the background you've pointed to in federal law enforcement.

                    <div class="comment-body">I had a soldier that "caught shrapnel" in his cheek while we were in Afghanistan. Ironically enough, we were attached to 7th Special Forces Group, Tim's old unit. It seemed so relatively minor that we really didn't think much of it, but the team's medic (18D) was very adamant about making sure that it gets a second look at the aid station when we RTB (return to base). 

Turns out, my soldier had a 7.62 bullet stuck in his face, from an apparent ricochet; which is why we thought it was just a bit of shrapnel or that he hit his face on something during the fight. That soldier got a purple heart for all that, and it's largely because that 18D was so adamant about doing his job.

I say all that to make a point: I don't for one fucking second believe that Tim Kennedy had shrapnel "millimeters away from his carotid artery," or that his 18D saw it and didn't care, nor did that medic make a point to examine it later to make sure it wasn't the mechanism of injury for something more serious. If any of his story was true, he would have a purple heart. He would have something, ANYTHING that would resemble a Valor award. But he doesn't even have an ARCOM with a V device, let alone a valorous Bronze Star. (An end of deployment Bronze Star is fundamentally different than one with a V device)</div>

Growing up, there was a guy in our neighborhood who was a Delta Force operator. The man looked like an in-shape Ned Flanders, super nice, always friendly, and always willing to help if you needed your car or bike fixed. Occasionally, after a barbecue cookout, he might casually mention a trip to the south of the border or some Cambodian jungle, but he never bragged or talked openly about it.

Then there was this Vietnam vet who used to spin wild stories about being deep cover in the jungle. Turns out he was a recruiter who got dishonorably discharged. The more people talk, the more BS they’re usually full of.</div>

Wife and I turn it on when we go to sleep all the time. Sometimes I wake up at 3:30 and the intro music is going and I remember that spooky feeling I’d get watching as a kid. That hair raising feeling that while I’m watching tv something spooky is watching me from outside my window.</div>

This was an old farm house right next to a dense forest on the foot of a mountain that is mostly uninhabited.

As a kid I was so terrified to watch this, alone, in my bedroom, in a tiny grainy tv with poor reception, when my parents where already asleep, looking at the vast forest tree line through the window. Still, I watched because I was so curious and if was so mysterious, and full of new concepts, and unknown stuff for me as a kid. Your description captured exactly the feeling I remember having</div>

It's only when their up close, personal, grabbing you, etc, that you cannot walk away and will need to fight. It's also better to subdue than to roundhouse kick them, knock them out, and have their head land on the concrete resulting in their death and a manslaughter charge.</div>

                    <div class="comment-body">BJJ sells itself by saying most fights go to the ground. What they conveniently omit is that for bjj to be effective, you first need to be on the ground, which is the last place you want to be in a self defense situation. It doesn’t help that BJJ spends no time working on takedown defense or throws. Anything in that nature is added after the fact outside of what can truly be considered BJJ.</div>

The colours under your moving finger "changed".  The rug did not.  Your moving finger represents consciousness.  The rug represents the multiverse.  The stain on the rug is nothing , ignore that, it looks like cum but it isn't.</div>
