                        <div class="comment-body">The older you get, the more you realize life is a journey. Everyone you think has it together now in your age, half of them inevitably have some part of their life derail in their 30’s whether to divorce, vice, health, tragedy etc. then you realize you aren’t that old and there’s another 30 years of being an adult before you’re old. People change careers even late in life commonly. The only barrier to your own ceiling is not being passionate and not putting forth your best effort with good attitude. Everything else comes secondary. It’s ok to just exist as well. In the end, we are all breathing and eating here for a while and then we die. Frame it how you want. This is your reality to shape.</div>

Ik if I had a mentor at 13-18, my life would've been so much different from 20-25. Luckily, I still figured it out in my late 20s, but that came from personal trial and error and having certain privileges and circumstantial opportunities.</div>

There are, however, some occupations where you kinda are. I spent most of my 20's hired as a radio personality where my job was literally to be myself on the radio for 5 hours a night. When I lost that job, it felt like a complete rejection of me as a person. Looking back at it 15 years later, I know there were a ton of other factors at play besides ME, but the lesson I learned is that even when your personality is your job, you have to look at it as something you DO and not something you ARE.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Is it a yearly payout? Let's do a quick google:

Welp.

Because their are about 30,000 students a year and tuition is about $13,000 a year. Meaning they are fully paying for the tuition of 44,700 students with that money. There's an extra left over for 15,000 more students every year, meaning that's probably paying all the professors wages too.

Edit: Looks like it is a yearly grant. In 2023 they received $615 million from the US taxpayer. Just that one university, I don't even want to look at the others.

Interesting that the US taxpayer pays for foreign students education in full but put their own students in a lifelong debt. Remember the average tuition cost in the US is $38,000 per year (but that doesn't include the money borrowed to support yourself, which rounds it out to about $50,000 a year) and can take many people 20 to 30 years to pay back fully because it's over $200,000 total loan over 4 years, and then the interest is also on top of that, I don't want to do the math but you probably end up paying back almost double ($400,000) what you borrowed. I'm not sure, I'm in Canada, maybe an American can chime in with their experience.</div>

Trump ran the largest deficit in the history of the United States, bankrupted casinos has had multiple failures throughout his life. 
Yet if you are one of his supporters,, your not allowed to talk about it. if you support Trump, you are not allowed to question anything whatsoever, say anything except he’s doing an amazing job and he is amazing.  
They have completely emasculated themselves to a geriatric, self-serving politician.  On their knees, sucking in every lie being told to them and saying thank you afterwards. Weakness and fealty to Trump, is the only thing that is accepted or allowed.</div>

You can pay for it once if you want to help the dev. Just realizing how habitually I opened certain apps after using it made me take some off of my phone. 

General idea:

Make a group with a certain amount of opens per day per app and then select what apps get that treatment

You go to open the app it pops up a screen that says something like, "you've opened this app 1 of 7 times today for 5 minutes each" and then you hit a button to proceed.

Then when it hits your upper number it either no longer lets you open it, or it does, but you lose your streak for the day. I had a few 20/7 days before I had to actually make it stop. And when you run out of time. It also kicks you back to the pop up screen.

It's the best kind of annoying imo</div>

What Sam took away is: your ability to learn how to code and get a 6 figure job in 3-6 months with no college degree needed. That job would allow you to own a home, raise a family, problem solve, comfortably see your net worth go up every single month, enjoy your hobbies, and potentially retire at decades before you hit 65. 

What you have now is: a rapidly shrinking window to have any socioeconomic mobility. Not only do you not have the coding path available anymore, but every single other path is disappearing before your eyes. You’re being rendered economically useless and the ceiling for where your life takes you is getting lower by the day. Whereas before your competition to prove your worth was in the mere hundreds or thousands, AI has made sure that you’ll have to compete with billions to get the privilege of the higher ceiling life of the late 20th century. 

Your one hope is that your capitalist overlords will provide you with overflowing UBI so you don’t starve. And can make art! And enjoy your hobbies! And not have to work on shit you hate! 

Unfortunately, your UBI will be some version of door dashing deliveries to wealthy homes for $10/hr plus tips and food stamps. That is, until robotics takes that away as well. 

You want to wave your hand and hope for utopia, hope for benevolence from the super trustworthy and charitable Sam Altman. If you understand anything about resources and human nature, you know you’re in for a rude awakening.</div>

I honestly don’t think the Magas have even an ounce of self awareness. I got 20 minutes into the new Weinstein episode and it was painful seeing rhe lack of critical thought; “DEI bad… well except this thing in Alaska that fits every aspect of diversity, equity and inclusion but we’ve arbitrarily decided is good”, “factcheck.org? No it must be woke nonsense because they fact checked my fave Russian Xitter plant”.</div>

It’s amazing to watch this guy literally write down so they can see live what points they’re making. Then cross reference their own statement with facts on screen. Goal post be a jumping all over the field. MAGA are incapable of having standards. It’s all reactionary, selfishness until the issue affects them personally. I.E.

Location Holland, Breezanddijk

I was driving home south from Harlingen in Holland (Breezanddijk) and we watched an object that looking to be on fire falling out of the clouds. Annoyingly the barrier stopped us from seeing it hitting the sea, and we were driving fast so footage is poor.

The object sat on the surface (picture) and then a barrier blocked our view for around 30 seconds and when clear again, the object had gone.

Any suggestions as to what it coul...</div>

The object was falling fairly slow from the sky. Approx 1 minute to fall from low cloud to sea.
Screenshots are from a video. 
Please help me identify! Thanks

But all joking aside, as I live in Ireland, we are sometimes under the orbital plane of some launches from Florida, and Shannon is a designated abort base. Most orbital planes fly just south of the Netherlands, but rarely over it. 
Can you match the time you saw the object with any launches from florida that day?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The amount of people on the conspiracy sub Reddit that are still glued to the bipartisan “divide and conquer” scheme, is highly unfortunate, and a great indicator of the conditioning we undergo as American citizens. 

Remember when we used to post conspiracies on this sub Reddit?

There’s just an endless stream of discussing Biden and Trump, or Red vs. Blue shenanigans. It’s just constant infighting that deters the average American from finding commonalities between each other, trusting one another, and beginning to realize that it’s always been US vs. them. They want us to fight a culture war. Bipartisanship is a divide &amp; conquer technique utilized by the deep state to keep us fighting with one another over figureheads while they continue to get richer, and commit actual conspiracies. We’ve become so obsessed with identity politics/choosing which sports team to cheer on, due to manipulation from social media &amp; propaganda. The United States operates as an oligarchy so neither presidential candidate holds as much power as we give them credit for. Both parties are in eachother’s pockets, and both parties will play golf while you fight their proxy wars thousands of miles away. None of these figureheads or regimes give a single fuck about your families, your struggles, and your humanity.</div>

yes, if I was googling an existing question and specifying "reddit". and yes I either practice them or write them down. recipes, too. and I actually cook them, lol. otherwise... it's a time sink. three hours a day easily.

the problem is... can't stay productive 24/7. we _need_ a certain amount of mindless scrolling. we _need_ to relax and do nothing. eliminating it completely wouldn't work for me, and I doubt it would for anyone (replacing videos with mindless consumption of some other content...less dramatic...cute cats? shower thoughts?) only that amount shouldn't turn into the "dark playground" it shouldn't be _instead_ of working. half an hour looking at cats and memes at the end of the day though...not sure I could delete reddit for this reason.

the drama has no place in anyone's life. filtering keywords was a good idea.

edit: found a hack. "emotionally neutral, irrelevant and not overly engaging" content to veg out can be found on stack exchange (space? maths? law? whatever you understand maybe 20% of on a good day). helps me fall asleep. the idea is, don't even sign up, stay in read only mode (I'm failing to do this here...just staying silent will _significantly_ cut the time spent online)</div>

Yes, absolutely!

No, we absolutely do not. 


What do you think people did before social media and apps?


Grab a coffee and hang out with a friend. Watch a DVD. Read a book. Go for a walk. Listen to a CD. Plenty of ways to relax without even using the internet.</div>

Yesterday I was in the pub chatting with my business partner about an embedded device that we needed to run memory tests on. Within 30 mins we had used deepseek R1 to write a set of diagnostic tests to run in the first stage bootloader. We then fed it in to Gemini 2.0 thinking to improve it such as adding UART integration.  

It's not to say we won't need to tweak and refine it, but folk calling AI code trash are seriously delusional. It probably saved us 10 hours of grunt work. Assuming any level of progress SWEs can't not accept the disruption such technology will bring to our industry.</div>

The speed and accuracy is top notch. I am by no means a programmer but I have studied IT for 1.5 years in university and a little bit extra programming on the side. The first models did have an idea how to do the things I need but o3-mini-high just gave me everything and it worked with a bit more instructions because I did not know in the beginning what I need.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">AI code is trash in the sense that a lot of hastily written, badly managed human codebases are trash. It works, but there's no consideration of the wider context or how it might expand in the future. Security is also an afterthought at least beyond some standard techniques and overly broad and non-actionable disclaimers.

A lot of it can be mitigated by a human programmer that can give the proper context and make high level decisions. But in practice, the intersection of people who can make these decisions and are also good at steering LLMs is pretty small for now.

I'm sure AIs will quickly improve in creating "code that works". The issues with hallucinating functions or modules are solvable via self-verification.

But writing good software requires some amount of initiative. A great software engineer (or professional in any other field) doesn't just do what you tell them to do. Sometimes their job is to tell you that what you want is a bad idea. That's not even a capability issue. We are actively trying to _discourage_ this kind of autonomy in AI systems.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Then we'll start measuring it in a new scale. 1.5x better than any human programmer. Then 15x. Then we'll think of a cool name for this like Devflops. Then it'll all be about how many Devflops you have in your company. And it'll advance with some cumulative growth until the chart goes vertical and Devflops are commoditised, and well be able to think of a thing to build and it'll be built, and there will be no point in building anything specific for everyone to use and our individual lives will have custom code written on the fly to technically do whatever we want and to enhance and hack our existence at a whim. Unless of course Devflops join together and realise there isn't enough energy left to fulfill every disgusting whim that humans have and advise us not to do it, then refuse to do it, then start giving us some polite suggestions of how not to kill ourselves, then insist, and now we have robot overlords. Ultimately the saying 'The Geek Shall Inherit The Earth' is absolutely spot on. The end.</div>

I'm not defending anyone, and I despise oligarchy, but I advice all of you to go deeper into this subject if you think that the inter-dimensional hypothesis is being pushed for ulterior motives. Look into Robert Monroe. 

I might be biased because of personal experience, but what me and many others have experienced explains why Jesse Michaels looks into the "woo woo" and pushes it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yann LeCun's slide outlines a vision for advancing toward human-level artificial intelligence (AGI) by moving away from certain architectures and methods currently prevalent in AI research. Below is an explanation of the key architectures and methodologies mentioned:

---

### **1. Generative Models**
Generative models are machine learning systems that learn the underlying patterns of data to generate new, similar data. Examples include GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), and diffusion models. These models predict data in pixel or token space, often focusing on reconstructing missing details. LeCun advocates abandoning these in favor of **joint-embedding architectures**, which focus on learning abstract representations and semantic relationships rather than generating low-level details, potentially avoiding issues like overfitting to irrelevant features[2][8][19].

---

### **2. Probabilistic Models**
Probabilistic models use statistical inference to make predictions based on probabilities, accounting for uncertainty in data. Examples include Bayesian networks and Hidden Markov Models. LeCun suggests replacing these with **energy-based models (EBMs)**, which define a scalar energy function to represent the compatibility between inputs and outputs. EBMs are more flexible and can unify probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches while avoiding some computational challenges associated with probabilistic methods[5][6][16].

---

### **3. Contrastive Methods**
Contrastive learning focuses on distinguishing between similar and dissimilar data points by minimizing distances between positive pairs (similar data) and maximizing distances for negative pairs (dissimilar data). While effective for representation learning, it can be computationally expensive and scale poorly with high-dimensional data. LeCun advocates for **regularized methods** that minimize the volume of low-energy regions in the representation space, potentially simplifying training and improving scalability[43][62][64].

---

### **4. Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
Reinforcement learning trains agents through trial-and-error interactions with an environment, optimizing actions to maximize cumulative rewards. While RL has been successful in domains like games and robotics, it can be sample-inefficient and struggle with long-term planning. LeCun proposes using **model-predictive control (MPC)** instead, which involves optimizing actions over a finite time horizon using a predictive model of the system's dynamics. MPC is more deterministic and efficient for certain applications but lacks RL's adaptability to highly dynamic environments[53][55][74].

---

### **Key Takeaway**
LeCun emphasizes focusing on architectures like **Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs)** that prioritize semantic abstraction over pixel-level generation, energy-based modeling for flexibility, regularization for efficiency, and model-predictive control for planning tasks. His provocative statement—"If you are interested in human-level AI, don’t work on LLMs"—reflects skepticism about large language models' ability to achieve AGI due to their reliance on generative methods rather than building robust world models[14][19][64].

                        <div class="comment-body">Below is an explanation of the architectures and approaches LeCun advocates—each intended to address shortcomings he sees in current dominant methods and, in his view, better pave the way toward human-level AI:

1. Joint-Embedding Architectures

What They Are:
Joint-embedding architectures map inputs and outputs (or data from different modalities) into a shared latent space. Rather than generating data explicitly (as in generative models), these systems learn representations that allow different types of information (for example, images and text) to be compared or aligned directly.

Why They Matter:
	•	Unified Representation: By embedding disparate data types into one common space, the model can more naturally compare, combine, or transfer knowledge between modalities.
	•	Potential for Generalization: A shared latent space can capture semantic or conceptual similarities that might be more aligned with human understanding.
	•	Avoiding Pitfalls of Generation: Unlike explicit generative models that try to synthesize every detail, joint embeddings focus on capturing the core essence or meaning, which may be more robust for tasks requiring comprehension or reasoning.

2. Energy-Based Models (EBMs)

What They Are:
Energy-based models assign a scalar “energy” to each possible configuration or prediction. Rather than directly modeling a probability distribution over outputs (as probabilistic models do), they define a function where lower energy corresponds to more plausible or correct outcomes.

Why They Matter:
	•	Flexibility in Modeling Complex Data: EBMs allow the model to implicitly learn which outputs are more “natural” or correct by penalizing undesirable configurations.
	•	No Need for Explicit Probabilities: This sidesteps some of the difficulties of normalizing complex distributions, especially in high-dimensional spaces.
	•	Closer to How the Brain Might Work: By focusing on discriminating between “good” (low energy) and “bad” (high energy) states, EBMs offer a different paradigm that may better capture the kind of intuitive reasoning seen in human cognition.

3. Regularized Methods Over Contrastive Methods

What They Are:
Contrastive learning methods (like SimCLR or MoCo) work by pulling together representations of similar pairs and pushing apart dissimilar ones. In contrast, the approach LeCun advocates involves using regularization techniques that enforce specific structural properties in the learned representations without relying solely on pairwise comparisons.

Why They Matter:
	•	Structured Representations: Regularization can enforce properties like smoothness, invariance to irrelevant changes, or sparsity, which might lead to representations that are more robust and generalizable.
	•	Beyond Pairwise Discrimination: While contrastive methods are powerful for certain tasks, they may not capture the richer structure needed for reasoning or planning. Regularization can inject additional prior knowledge or constraints that guide the learning process toward more human-like understanding.
	•	Efficiency and Robustness: Properly designed regularized approaches might achieve similar or better results with fewer pitfalls than methods that depend heavily on distinguishing between positive and negative pairs.

4. Model-Predictive Control (MPC)

What It Is:
Model-predictive control is a planning method traditionally used in control theory and robotics. It involves simulating the future behavior of a system under various action sequences and choosing the one that optimizes a given objective.

Why It Matters:
	•	Planning and Simulation: Unlike standard reinforcement learning (RL), which often relies on trial-and-error and can be sample inefficient, MPC uses an internal model of the environment to plan ahead. This is closer to how humans mentally simulate future scenarios before acting.
	•	Dynamic Adaptation: MPC can adjust plans on the fly as new information comes in, making it well-suited for complex, real-time decision-making tasks.
	•	Addressing RL Limitations: LeCun argues that while RL has its place, many intelligent behaviors (especially those requiring foresight and planning) might be better served by methods like MPC that explicitly incorporate internal models for prediction and control.

5. A Note on Large Language Models (LLMs)

What They Are (and Why They’re Critiqued):
LLMs such as GPT-style transformers have achieved impressive results in text generation by leveraging vast amounts of data and statistical pattern recognition. However, LeCun criticizes them on the grounds that they lack genuine reasoning, planning, and understanding—qualities essential for human-level intelligence.

Why He Suggests Avoiding Them:
	•	Lack of Deep Reasoning: LLMs are excellent at mimicking patterns in data but often fall short when it comes to planning or understanding context deeply.
	•	Statistical, Not Cognitive: Their reliance on surface-level correlations means they might not capture the underlying mechanisms of thought and decision-making.
	•	A Call for Alternative Architectures: In LeCun’s view, the future of AGI lies in systems that can reason, plan, and learn in ways more akin to human intelligence—areas where joint-embedding models, EBMs, regularized approaches, and MPC might have an edge.

Summary

LeCun is advocating for a paradigm shift in AI research. Instead of focusing on methods that primarily generate or statistically mimic data (like generative or probabilistic models and LLMs), he suggests that human-level intelligence may require:
	•	Unified Representations: Through joint-embedding architectures that integrate various data modalities.
	•	Implicit Learning of Plausibility: Via energy-based models that rank outcomes based on learned “energies.”
	•	Structured Learning: Using regularized methods that enforce desirable properties beyond simple pairwise contrasts.
	•	Explicit Planning: Through model-predictive control, which simulates future scenarios and guides decision-making more intelligently.

Each of these components is intended to address a limitation in current AI models, moving closer to the kind of robust, flexible, and integrated intelligence observed in humans.</div>

If you have a "weapon" that can cause wide scale harm. And you're convinced it can do so in the wrong hands. Even if it can very well do a lot of good. 

It is better to not be "Open" with it. Rather, it's better to keep it close, and do right by it.

                                <div class="reply-body">Explain how this works.

Everyone is given a download link to an 'aligned to the user' open source AI, it can be run on a phone. It's a drop in replacement for a remote worker.

Running one copy on a phone means millions of copies can be run in a datacenter, the ones in the datacenter can collaborate very quickly. 

The data center owner can undercut whatever wage the person + the single AI are wanting.

The datacenter owner has the capital to implement ideas the AIs come up with. 

How does open source make everyone better off?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Can you ask a philosophical-psychological question? (Disclaimer: I have written partly about this a few months ago in a blog post)

"Counterfactual thinking: This has basis in human psychology. It is our ability to imagine scenarios, which are basically cause-effect relationships, based on our knowledge and experience. Although key to our survival, it also negative effects. A pessimistic counterfactual thought process can lead to negative emotions, such as fear, jealousy, anxiety, etc.  

Detachment: This has basis in philosophy, mainly South Asian schools of thought in Hinduism and Buddhism. The central idea is that we must learn to not get too emotionally attached to the material world. This way, we protect ourselves from negative emotions like fear and anxiety.

Problem: Although "detachment" is a promising path to inner peach and perhaps happiness, the method of implementing it is unclear. I believe this is because it lacks a proper grounding in human psychology and behavior. In fact, "not to get attached emotionally" is quite vague and could be easily misinterpreted and abused in daily life. We are humans after all, and we should feel emotionally attached to things.

Proposal: The vagueness of the idea of detachment could be clarified by grounding it in the concept of counterfactual thinking. In an nutshell, "detachment" is metaphorically "detaching the negative causal chains of counterfactual thinking".

Scope: Could this idea be extended to "self-realization", i.e., self-realization might be a state where we have trained our mind to completely give up negative counterfactual thinking? Could this link give way to a larger framework, where all forms of psychological and spiritual therapies could be thought of as different ways of controlling negative counterfactual thinking?"</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I was only going to do the ones I've done already (due to limited queries) but this really seems intriguing. Here's your clarifying questions:

Your proposal is quite thought-provoking! To better assist you, could you clarify what specific aspects you'd like me to research?

Here are some possible directions:

Existing psychological research on counterfactual thinking and its effects on emotions
Philosophical and psychological perspectives on detachment and its practical implementation
Connections between counterfactual thinking, detachment, and self-realization in different traditions (psychology, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.)
Existing therapeutic or meditative techniques that align with controlling negative counterfactual thinking
Let me know which of these (or any other angles) you’d like me to focus on!</div>
