In his mind, the fate of humanity depends on everything he does.

Dude wants to be the real life Tony Stark in the worst way, without realizing that the dividing line between him and Stark (if he was a real person) is Stark's selflessness, the willingness to sacrifice himself and everything he has, including his life, to protect humanity. Elon doesn't have a shred of that in him. 

He's only interested in 'saving humanity' as long as he gets all of the recognition and profit when it goes well, none of the blame and gets bailed out financially (usually off the backs of tax payers and middle class Elon simps) when it fucks up.</div>

Trump let them do it on steroids and is now going to either let Israel annex it or WE are going to annex it.

No establishment political party is clean here. Our tax money helped fund this. Yes, October 7th, but we don't have that side as a client state and at ANY TIME America could have stoped Israel from causing this genocide. 

This is why AIPAC donates to BOTH sides and why we need to get money the fuck out of politics!</div>

lol no, the party whose leader ISNT posting AI memes about the hotel he's going to build in Gaza after he "removes" all the Palestinians is fucking squeaky clean in comparison.

"Both sides", Biden didn't stop a genocide......but thats not even REMOTELY the same as proposing a quicker genocide using American troops and posting memes about the hotels your going to build on the rubble, get the fuck out of here

This is literally how it happens; "Yea, the guy now is literally proposing a genocide and meming about, but the last guy wasn't great either"</div>

We scroll for hours on reddit because we feel like we're learning and discovering. We're not though. For example, I follow a few philosophy subreddits. But if I truly want to learn about philosophy, I should read a book or watch a lecture from an actual academic expert on the subject. Not randos on the internet with no actual expertise. 

I use to have the same problem with YouTube. I'd watch a ton of video essays and while some of t...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’ve reached the same conclusion as well. I used to believe that I need to consume as much content as possible to get the maximum information possible to form my opinion. But this was having the opposite effect: it was frying my brain and confusing me and overwhelming me because it was just too much. I was also forgetting things a lot in my daily life because I was consuming too much information, like I would forget whether I had already told my husband something and was telling it to him twice and he would tell me that I had already told him that. Then I started to realize that my brain can’t hold nor process that much information, so I started becoming more intentional about it too. I have become very intentional about using YouTube. I only watch it for my daily yoga and meditation practice and if ever I specifically want to watch one video once in a while. I watch a good movie about once a week. And I am aiming to replace all my video consumption by books and novels, which would encourage deeper thinking and give my brain the time it needs to process things. I think that our brains are not meant to be consuming as much content as we are exposed to nowadays because I believe that it’s literally driving us insane, so, as Cal Newport extols, digital minimalism is crucial to retain a little bit of sanity in this overly fast-paced world.</div>

and more ppl need to hear this

most “learning” online is just performative consumption  
you *feel* smarter but can’t recall a thing a day later

and yeah—random opinions from strangers don’t make you wiser  
they just make you louder inside

real learning has friction  
books  
lectures  
long-form anything

and real entertainment? enjoy it guilt-free  
but pick the good stuff, not the brain slop designed to keep you scrolling

junk food is fine  
but stop eating out of the trash

They are massive giant with infinite resources, battling for their space. OpenAI is a fun jumpstart, but they are still reliant on others, and all those messy interests that come with it, ultimately making them reliant on everyone which makes them vulnerable. 

Google doesn't have that issue. Just all the resources they need, under their control, so they can take their time and choke out the competition. 

I'm sure, soon OAI will release another SOTA model, and Google will just continue to quietly march ahead</div>

Now you're saying Google's version is significantly better? Damn... I'll be wasting all my money on LLMs at this pace lol. I've never been able to study as effectively in my entire existence as I am right now while using these tools. They're rapidly progressing from being quirky toys that can do some tricks to actually useful tools that help with a lot of things and produce high-quality outputs. LLMs may not become AGI, but they sure as hell can be great pocket assistants. People who say they couldn't find any use for them whatsoever are seriously lacking some imagination or prompting skills.</div>

That's not true. First of all, the Western Wall was part of Jordan until the 1967 war. No American president visited Israel before 1974. Nixon visited Israel in 1974, but not the Western Wall. Carter visited Israel in 1979, but not the Western Wall. Reagan never visited Israel. George HW Bush didn't visit Israel during his presidency. I haven't found out if he ever went to the Western Wall.</div>

"You say you don't like the current system but when we burn our country to the ground, suddenly you care" as if that's a solid point. 


I can not like how our system currently works and simultaneously not enjoy when someone lights a match to my country.</div>

See, checkmate!” 

They miss the point on purpose. 

There’s a MAGA dude in one of my group chats irl &amp; there’s a couple MAGA sympathizers/both sidesers in there &amp; when we voiced that we’re just legitimately concerned for America &amp; want the best for our country &amp; what we’re seeing is not that… we were met with memes &amp; feet pics on the beach thanking Trump for allowing him to afford a vacation. 

They won’t actually discuss anything in good faith because they’re aware their operatives are operating *in* bad faith. They don’t give a fuck. It’s time &amp; has been time for a long time to burn the right to the ground domestically &amp; globally. They are not working toward the same goal as the rest of humanity. Nor are their ideals virtuous. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I can fully understand where Carmack is coming from for the most part. His stance is pretty pragmatic and logical. 

However, *do* people have a good argument against the whole “pulling the ladder up” angle tho? Because it *is* kind of a convenient stance to take from someone who’s already “had their turn” in terms of having a prominent career in software engineering. I can totally see how this type of attitude could definitely come off very “fuck you, got mines”-coded. Especially when it comes from people that aren’t really as “at risk” in terms of being made irrelevant by AI. (Carmack will always be a legend in the industry, so AI is basically playing with house money for him. That isn’t true for the upcoming engineers hoping to have a similar career to him tho.)</div>

Look at that silly argument. “Oh it makes games that would require the work of multiple devs into something that needs less people working on it!!!”. As if that’s not literally the history of technology since forever.

What are these folks even wanting to see? AI not existing? Surely it’s not something that stupid, surely they know that never in the history of mankind have we ever collectively decided to not pursue advancements in a technology.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/TommyShelbyPFB:

---

Knapp and Corbell posted a full detailed breakdown along with flight tracker data of the incident:

[https://www.weaponizedpodcast.com/news-1/uss-jackson-tic-tac-uap](https://www.weaponizedpodcast.com/news-1/uss-jackson-tic-tac-uap)

The part that stood out to me is **"synchronized and instantaneous departure - indicative of shared communication".** All 4 crafts were observed departing at the same exact time with instantaneous acceleration.

**The Solution: Decision Density Mapping (sounds fancy, but it's actually simple)** 

Here's the weird system I accidentally created:

\-Grab a notebook and track EVERY decision you make for 3 days (warning: it gets depressing fast)

\-For each decision, jot down: how much mental energy it took (1-10) and how much impact...</div>

How is this even feasible?  I make 20 decisions an hour on smaller and larger scales.  Just writing them down and rating them will take more time than is possible in a day.  

I just made a decision to answer this post.  Mental Energy: 1, Impact: 1</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You're absolutely right - tracking EVERY decision would be completely insane (and probably drive anyone to madness).

In practice, track only decisions that require conscious thought (not "should I respond to this email" but "how should I handle this tricky client situation").  
Focus on work/productivity decisions, not everything ("banana or apple for snack" isn't worth recording).  
Try it for 2-3 hours a day for a few days, not constantly

When I tested this on myself, I realized I make about 30-40 "meaningful" decisions daily, not thousands. Those are the **key choices** that actually impact productivity.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I just said this yesterday as my partner and I were watching a documentary on WWII.

"Make Germany Great Again" actually had a leg to stand on because their nation had been smacked down *hard* after WWI. They remembered having an empire and could look around and see how different things were.

"Make America Great Again" is horseshit because we *have* been on top of the world for the better part of a century. What huge, national loss has been slapped on us by the outside world? What "greatness" do we suddenly lack and yearn to return to? Ironically, with Trump running rough shod over the economy and our international alliances, MAGA can convincingly be applied to mean a return to a time before Trump.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hi everyone, I (36F) need some help. I used to be a voracious reader in my childhood and teenage years. 

In college, I signed up for Facebook and, since then, I can count the number of books I’ve finished (15+ years ago!) and I hate myself for it. 

I used to relish sitting down with a book for hours and every time I try to do it now, my mind wanders and seeks instant gratification I suppose, which is what social media and YouTube videos got us used to. 

But I want to get back to the older me ...</div>

Feel the joy of being offline, the liberating feeling of knowing no one can contact you. You are not part of the world anymore. Be local, and enjoy it.


Now you start to read. It will be boring are first, but that is it just the brain "digesting" healthy food. You'll learn to enjoy it. There's no other way; enjoy reading, or be bored.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I found picking up books I loved when I was younger to be very helpful in getting back to reading. Ideally a good long series.

Early pandemic, I picked up Percy Jackson. Loved the books but it’d been a while and more new books had been added to the series since I read them. Falling back in love with those characters, and reading consistently because there were many books, felt natural. It’s an easy read that is just enjoyable and fun. My sister only ever read the first two Harry Potter books as a kid, and read the entirety a few years ago. Now she reads more than she ever did when we were kids (I was the one with my nose in a book)!

Since then I have been reading pretty regularly. I mainly do audiobooks but I like to have something for bedtime reading, too. Also, I gotta rec a few favorites, and I am obsessed with both of these books.


- Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir, I highly recommend the audiobook but overall just an excellent read. Movie comes out in 2026 I believe. Great sci-fi and pretty understandable even if you aren’t especially science-minded.

- Yellowface by RF Kuang, I could not stop reading this. The author says she wanted reading it to feel like a panic attack, and I can really relate. Incredibly intense in the best way.</div>

I started with some old guilty pleasure favorites from back then and didn't worry about the loftier ideas about reading and expanding my mind, and instead focused on just rebuilding my spark for reading. Once that connection is rebuilt, and your brain remembers that you enjoy reading, it's easier to make the pivot into new content.</div>

Edit: I started a deep research report when I made this comment so around 6:00 pm, and it just finished, 38 minutes later. Interesting since OpenAI Deep Research doesn’t like to go as high usually (although for the report in question, I used ChatGPT took 78 minutes to answer the same questions.)

After writing that and being excited to check the results, this is what I got 😃

https://preview.redd.it/wm5o1joivote1.jpeg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfc788381e25486f99041d89b028af467f51d95e

All I did was give it my supplement stack and ask it to tell me about each ingredient using the latest scientific research. OpenAI Deep Research actually gave me an amazing answer, and while this is only my first attempt at using Google’s new version, shit like this makes me not even want to try it again.

Edit 2: Turns out you don’t choose “Deep Research” in the dropdown menu, you have to choose Gemini 2.5 Pro, then press “+” and choose Deep Research there. Confusing for sure, but I’ll try my prompt again and update this comment one last time. Thanks u/Gaiden206

Edit 3: the report I got from the actual Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Research was extremely good, especially because it looked at over 300 sources while ChatGPT Deep Research only used around 45 sources for the same query. I’m still reading the report but it’s definitely *that* bit more in-depth than OpenAI’s version, so this is very promising.</div>

You need to select 2.5 Pro from the model chooser and then select "Deep Research" from the "+" button in the prompt bar.

1. **The 50/10 Rule**: Study for 50 mins, break for 10. Your brain retains info better in chunks, and those 10 mins are perfect for a quick walk or a snack.

2. **Hydration Station**: Keep a water bottle handy. Dehydration = fatigue, and we don’t need that during an all-nighter.

3. **Active Recall &gt; Passive Reading**:...</div>
