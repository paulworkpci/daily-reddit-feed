My question is this - why is this additional value not showing up somewhere? It's entirely possible that I'm not looking in the right places, but we should have had a lot more displacement by now

                        <div class="comment-body">Many people often ignore economics basics. Increasing productivity by 100% doesn't make GDP grow by 100% it also doesn't halve needed labor. The reason is that needed labor is basically infinite (best seen in research, healthcare, software development, etc.) and much of work is done in competition with others which most of the time doesn't fundamentally change the amount of consumption and generation of goods. This is imo best seen in marketing: Fashion brand A gets more productive in marketing because of AI and outcompetes brand B, but this won't necessarily increase production as the demand for clothing is basically fixed (not exactly true, but you get the point). Also after some point brand B also gets more productive so not much has changed from a economical view.

This is only the economic aspect. But it's also quite obvious that we're not there yet from a technical standpoint. I think we only will see significant layoffs when models will learn to learn to continually. Just think of your own work: Do you think that AI is able to replace you? If yes, then I am assuming to let the AI do everything for you while you are enjoying your life? ;)

  
Another perspective is this: As long as Human + AI is better than just AI then there will be incentive to keep hiring. If you don't keep hiring you're in danger to be outcompeted at some point, especially if you're not in a monopoly.</div>

Absolutely not! If it was the case, we wouldn't have issues finding jobs ever. The needed labor IS limited and this oversight of considering it infinite is the biggest problem with capitalism. Because normal people often can only offer labor and when the demand is met, then labor is devalued, salaries drop and people suffer.</div>

First off this is just not true. This is a selling point AI companies want you to believe but it's just not manifesting in reality.  Which is exactly why they are not seeing any big booms to production since AI has been pushed into certain workplaces. They are pretty much putting out the same trajectory of output as before.</div>

It only boosts productivity if they learn how to use it, if they're allowed to use and then actually use it.

That's three barriers in the way of adoption which are very present almost everywhere. Some companies are scrambling to put together education and training packages but AI is an odd tool to train people on: not high enough reliability and functions are too generic. By the time the package is ready, the tech is different. By the time the course starts, it's outdated, by the time it ends it's useless. It's a good time to be a fast learner. Not as many of those around.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed. In software development, it's barely proving to boost productivity at all so far - one (decent) study suggested it actually slows down development. Coding speed is rarely the bottleneck in software development in any case, so there's a limit to what it can achieve there without completely taking over.

I'm trying to get better at using it - it's definitely very useful for small-to-medium-sized isolated tasks like writing scripts, creating skeletons, etc.</div>

&gt;The cycle of scientific discovery is frequently bottlenecked by the slow, manual creation of software to support computational experiments. To address this, we present an AI system that creates expert-level scientific software whose goal is to maximize a quality metric. The system uses a Large Language Model (LLM) and Tree Search (TS) to systematically improve the quality metric and intelligently navigate the large space of possible solutions. The system achieves expert-level results when it explores and integrates complex research ideas from external sources. The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated across a wide range of benchmarks. In bioinformatics, it discovered 40 novel methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated 14 models that outperformed the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. Our method also produced state-of-the-art software for geospatial analysis, neural activity prediction in zebrafish, time series forecasting and numerical solution of integrals. By devising and implementing novel solutions to diverse tasks, the system represents a significant step towards accelerating scientific progress.

Pretty interesting. I wonder if it can be applied to model training.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That's the problem. I don't prefer working with junior devs. I would rather be a manager and give it to a senior developer than to be a senior developer working with a junior developer. The thing that takes it 2 hours to do with boilerplates I can do as senior in 10 minutes (assuming I have the boilerplate already saved somewhere, i.e. same with templates and such). And then doing complex things will be even easier to do than to describe in detail and then to teach it how to fix.

At least with a junior dev, you're training someone who is actually going to be senior on the long term and who needs a job to put a roof above their head.</div>

It's a rather new skillset because most developers **are not** great delegators *(that tends to be more of a technical management or senior developer skill)*, so it's no surprise that many developers are struggling to see how these tools slot into their workflow.</div>

I would say that it's what makes LLMs a great tool for technical leads. We have lots of meetings, and can run LLMs in the background. Also, we are used to review code we have not written ourselves. The only difference is that usually, the pull-request etiquette prevents us from rewriting an entire pull request, while with generated code that's perfectly acceptable to throw it away and code it from scratch.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Scaling in them is painful, yes! I have an expo app started with bolt, now in production with a hundred user or so, once it got too big , Bolt would warn me that  it was too big of a project and would eat my tokens really fast,  and so it did.  Lovable has the same issue, once there's a lot of tokens involved it credits fly out of the account. At least in my experience.  
  
But saying Lovable  or Bolt lock you in is very unfair, I have moved dozens of repos out of them very easily and taken data out  supabase is fairly straighforwward

                        <div class="comment-body">Yeah, that’s the tradeoff I’ve seen too. Tools like Lovable or Bolt feel great when you’re still in the “make screens fast” phase, but the moment you want to plug in something atypical, you hit walls.  

I’ve run into the same thing in design systems. Early on, you accept the defaults because it saves time. Then suddenly you need a spacing scale that maps to dev tokens, or color roles that adapt to dark mode, and you realize the foundation wasn’t built for it. You can hack it for a while, but every layer of hack makes the system harder to change.  

The shift for me was: don’t optimize for minute-one speed, optimize for month-three flexibility. Start with something boring but real, otherwise you’ll just pay the tax later tearing it all apart.  

If Solid hands you standard React + Node + Postgres, that mindset actually lines up with how I treat design in Figma. Rather set up the underlying tokens cleanly once than live with fragile defaults that block you later.</div>

"Achieving precise, localized drug delivery within the brain remains a major challenge due to the restrictive nature of the blood–brain barrier and the risk of systemic toxicity. Here, we present a fully soft neural interface incorporating a thermo-pneumatic peristaltic micropump integrated with asymmetrically tapered microchannels for targeted, on-demand wireless drug delivery. All structur...</div>

Im not a scientist or a researcher so these aren't facts but im pretty sure anxiety can cause this and obviously many other mental health disorders.

Yes you can free yourself from your own mind and look at your 'life story' and  your 'ego' from a perspective.   
I suggest you to start from reading a book or two (the Power Of Now, The Untethered Soul).   
Then practice what they say.   
Good luck.</div>

Look at the first paragraph: "At first I was furious, my glass container kept coming back greasy or not at all." Someone is stealing your food and you're mad about the container, not the food? You're hungry at work now, or at least have inconvenience yourself to order something. 

So I can't tell if [that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1nbjq4z/everyone_thinks_i_caught_our_office_lunch_thief_i/) is for sure AI written or augmented, or just someone who has this same sort of predictable style (Reddit self posts have always had lots of writing cliches like "like clockwork", "dumb little detail but it got me", the way the second paragraph is written). One thing that suggests that it was composed using AI is that the comments OP makes show repeated grammar mistakes while the original post does not. 

&gt;Karma farming? Like trying to get karma? Okay thanks for tell me but obviously is not my goal

Thanks for tell*ing* me. Obviously *that* is not my goal.

&gt;Thanks a lot everyone for real, I can not read all the comment but I appreciate it. And I’m not a AI or bot, no idea why you say that

*cannot*. *an* AI. all the comment*s*. why you *would* say that. 

Notably, only these comments saying "I'm not a bot" have these grammar errors. The other more generic responses do not.</div>

All of content AI can create is becoming better for sure and there will be time, it will be hard to distinguish from human created content for sure, but the feeling of meeting and interacting with the real human behind writing some of the books, movies, tv shows, music is something which can not be replicated by ai bots, atleast not with llm models as they stand today.

  
The above post is great example, the writing is good, story is cohesive, but it is just that a story, not a real situation and hence not better than someone just fabricating a story and putting up online to get sympathy and reactions.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I was similar to you in that binge eating ruined any semblance of progress with improvement in body composition doing CrossFit. I “dieted” for 7 yrs, weighing and measuring food, tracking 90% of meals, but binge eating, having kids and moving into a sedentary role meant I just slowly got fatter and fatter until I literally looked like a potato and enough was enough.

I have been on Mounjaro since January 2025, 45lbs down so far (216-170) with no noticeable muscle or strength loss. I was doing Linchpin for a year but switched to RP Strength Hypertrophy App doing whole body split 5x days per week for two reasons, the first being I could not fuel CrossFit style workouts or jump around doing burpees etc while feeling so full all the time, and the second was a fear of muscle loss so wanted to focus on at least keeping what I’d built. Never went below 1800kcals per day.

I’m about 4 weeks (8lbs) from goal weight and I’ll be running a maintenance phase on RP and then 2x muscle building phases before switching back to linchpin once I can maintain “balance” and I’m happy with body composition. 

I will say though, that I may have to, and will be happy to, stay on a low dose of Mounjaro for the rest of my life if the desire to binge returns. I have eaten a pizza and a pile of chocolate at least once a week my whole adult life, often in secret but since the first jab that switch has firmly been turned off and it feels so liberating. I haven’t touched pizza or chocolate for 9 months and have zero desire to. 

The good news is my max strict deadhang pull up went from 5 to 12!</div>

Quite a few people there are doing serious gymnastics to deny and defend Trump.

We all know.

They also know.

They are defending a child rapist.

I'd like to think the worst of them are posting from a forced labor camp in Russia, but there are quite a few homegrown Americans that stupid.

I look forward to reading Trump's obituary. I hope I read it while he is in prison for these crimes.

Child rapists have no place in any society.</div>

I have been using Claude Code probably within 2-3 weeks of it first being released. I have been on the $100 plan and rarely hit the limits as I don't use it 24/7 and generally found it to be capable of doing what I wanted it to.

I do find that it struggles a bit with longer custom commands and recently had an issue where I was working through a deeply nesting mocking issue with vitest. I decided to switch over to Codex and it did manage to solve it.

I still prefer Claude Code, but my usage has now switched to 70% CC 30% Codex. I think the biggest point you mention is the cost comparison. I am just on the $20 Codex tier and I was able to work with Codex for hours without hitting any limit. If I was on the $20 CC plan I'd be at the limit within about 20-40 minutes.</div>

It is also more integrated in GitHub and I just used it a few days ago to vibe code a complete, complex and large project (although controlled by a architectural overview document and skeleton app build by ChatGPT Pro).

So my winning combo is: ChatGPT Pro for architecture and GitHub Copilot as a worker doing the prompts the architect prepares.</div>

TL;DR:

&gt; His research argues that the mechanism driving AI outputs is mathematically equivalent to a multi-spin thermal system — a well-studied structure in physics. 


Explanation: 

&gt;Each token in a prompt (a word or fragment) is modelled as a “spin" in a high-dimensional space. The LLM’s attention mechanism (its way of focusing on certain parts of a prompt) amounts to calculating interactions between these spins. In physics terms, it’s a two-body interaction, like gravity or magnetism.


&gt;This setup allows the authors to derive an equation predicting when a model’s output will shift, or “tip,” from good (that is, factually accurate) to bad (misleading or false). 


&gt;“The tipping point is determined from the very start," Johnson explains. “It’s hard-wired by the structure of the prompt and the model’s training."</div>

Interesting work. 

Love this quote as it shows there is hope for improvement: 

&gt;Its 2-body form suggests why LLMs work so well, but hints that a generalized 3-body Attention would make such AI work even better. Its similarity to a spin-bath means that existing Physics expertise could immediately be harnessed to help Society ensure AI is trustworthy and resilient to manipulation.</div>

However they always show shorts.  Even though you click show less.  It’s like it forgets and just shows you more the next time. It’s dumb.
