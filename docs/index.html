I don't keep them in a bag, just set them in there.  Wash them off when you're ready to eat them.  Make sure to check them regularly, and remove any bad ones.  Buying in bulk is a good way to save money, and they will stay fresh for quite a while.

The difference? I'm much more tired than when I drank caffeine, and far less productive.

That's the truth.

No memory improvements. No brain fog difference. No anxiety reduction. Honestly i'm less productive than before, probably about 50% as productive.

Caffeine made me feel good and locked in. I feel unplugged without it most of the time.

I stopped because I had a focal seizure and caffeine now triggers an uneasy feeling in me.

I haven't touched it since because anything super stimulating now gives me depersonalization/derealization.

I miss caffeine everyday, and may try to build tolerance to it again very slowly. I'm still fairly productive (especially at night) and have natural drive for success, but caffeine took me from about 70% functionality to 110%.</div>

The video talked about how we’re always anxious and never bored anymore. Think about it, when was the last time you were truly bored? Not the “ugh, this routine is dull” kind of bored, but the “I have absolutely nothing to do” kind of bored. 

For me, that was probably when I was a kid. These days I’m always occupied. My brain is constantly engaged, there’s always something to...</div>

The ‘old ways’ of teaching no longer work and there is no work flow state for me anymore - I’m always having to stop due to someone checking a phone, not focusing on the task, not hearing instructions etc. it’s been a huge change (I’ve been teaching 15 years) particularly the current 11 year olds.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’ve seen the same thing with my cousins. One is a 5 yo girl, and the other is a 6 yo boy (different families). The boy has had a phone in his hands since he was really young because his parents found it easier to just give him a screen instead of dealing with him. On the other hand, the girl isn’t allowed to watch TV for more than an hour a day.

And you can really see the difference in how they act. The girl is super smart for her age, she knows about current events, different sports, and sm recipes. She spends a lot of time with her parents, so she learns a lot just from being around them. And the boy is the complete opposite. He throws tantrums all the time, doesn’t talk to people properly, and is way behind his younger cousin in terms of knowledge and social skills. I know I shouldn’t be comparing kids like this but it’s so shocking.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The social shift is crazy. When I was a kid (and even beyond my 'kid' years), giving a phone to your kid was seen as helicopter parenting.

Now everyone thinks they'll die if they don't have a phone glued somewhere on their person.

It's not unreasonable to have all the kids put their phones in a container and collect them after class.

Any 'emergency' excuses are emotional manipulation (in 99.99% of cases).</div>

Then the realisations kept coming, no whale would just stand there and let it happen.

This is objectively not a good start so far:

* Lie about "drones"
* Bury the UAP issue under 5 conspiracies the "Task Force" will never get to with an arbitrary 6 month deadline
* Gutting agencies like NOAA that research UAPs for no reason that nobody asked for
* Zero action from the White House, executive orders about everything under the sun except UAPs

It was like hearing "We will never tell you the truth" broadcast from the White House podium.  

At least we used to get Obama's candid interviews on talk shows.  And the Schumer Amendment (gutted by republicans).  There were still lies (Susan Gough, Kirkpatrick/AARO, Bill Nelson trying to discredit David Grousch, etc) but the DOD did the UFO lying from the WH podium during the Dem administrations.  

Now WH press secretary and staff do the lying on their behalf instead of representing US as our elected officials.  That sucks.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">For real. I had a period where I was grabbed by YouTube shorts and dragged into a brainrot cycle. When I broke it, my attention span was fried. I used to study for four hours at a time, and there I was nearly shaking and crying from boredom after reading for half an hour. I also used to feel very bored and unfulfilled. I cut off all TikTok-style content from my life as well as other mindless but “enjoyable” slop, and my life improved heavily. Then I made a habit of reading 50 pages a day, baby steps - and it truly helped my mind.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm not against books as a concept, but there is so much trash out there that I feel funny the way people romanticize them lately. Go into a bookstore and the fiction section will be dominated by trite, poorly-written stuff like romantasy. Non-fiction is a minefield of pop-psych, true crime (the whole genre seems icky and voyeuristic to me), various forms of junk science, whitewashed political profiles, etc.

I dunno, maybe it's just a me problem, but I wish I could walk into a bookstore and easily find a good book without having to do a bunch of research beforehand. If all this is the stuff that the masses are reading, then I don't know that non-readers are really missing out on that much</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Reading requires sustained attention, firing up parts of the brain involved with language, comprehension, learning, emotion and imagination. It's really something powerful that can't be replicated with television or internet use which are passive in nature. In fact, those activities are probably diminishing our abilities to read for a prolonged length of time, degrading attention and hindering creativity in the process.

As to what to read, you might want to stick to the classics first. Renowned, proven authors.

There's just an infinite wealth of texts and books to read from all ages available for all to read.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">As a late teen, in the early stages of Omegle/Chatroulette, I found myself chatting with a girl who initiated some explicit video chatting. I was excited and nervous. 

As things progressed, she asked me to put a finger up my butt. I tried to dance around it but she was persistent and offered some enticing visuals in return. I figured I was smart so I bent my pointer finger and knuckled my asshole and pretended to be going to town. It worked! She reciprocated with a request of mine! I’m the man!

Her screen cuts to black….

She starts typing….

I receive a message that she is going to send this video to my family and post it online. I am now shitting bricks. I call her bluff. Her black screen starts to play back our video chat. Then, she sends me a link. I am on some random porn site knuckling my asshole. A screen shot of my Facebook follows the link. I don’t know how she got it but it was around that time where you can list your family members and I had about 10 listed. 

She leaves the chat….

Now at 2am on a random week night I start sending everyone in my family messages that if they receive a video of me, to please not watch it through the end. 

My family asked me questions for weeks and nothing came of it. I reported to the website where my 15 minutes of fame was posted stating I was my father and I’m a minor and the video was removed.

Horny teen with a laptop, very bad. I am also not on any social media aside from this because I’m traumatized to this day that the ol’ chocolate knuckle may resurface.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is such a ridiculous argument from the start. Like he’s the first billionaire/multimillionaire who somehow was devoid of greed and not wanting to just accumulate more wealth for the sake of wealth, like they all do.

Reminds me of the quote from The Departed, “I haven’t *needed* the money since I stole little Timmy’s lunch money in 6th grade. But I like it it”.

People talk all the time about how politicians are bought and paid and they never thought about who is dying the buying and paying. All they did was cut out the middle man and put the wealthy businessman right into office.

Or even more ridiculous is when they’d talk about how “he doesn’t have to do this! Why would he choose to run for president if he didn’t care when he could just be retired?”

Like every single authoritarian or even just politician is just a bleeding heart and taking the most powerful position in the world out of the goodness of their heart, not because they want power.</div>

If you understand Chinese and can search, you’ll find the sources. I’m sure the CIA has as well. 

I’m not certain that future LLM advances are going to require near-infinite compute training though. There’s likely an upper bound of diminishing returns the closer we get to expert-tier human intelligence.

~1m H100 SoCs might be sufficient for near-AGI training</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Conspiracy theories about possible alien interference with Phobos 2 predate the existence of 4Chan. I have a comic anthology book from 1995 that outlines in detail the Phobos 2 alien conspiracy (amongst many other things), so by 1995 it was well known enough to be getting a comic book adaptation. For the curious the book is The Big Book of Conspiracies by Doug Moench, amusingly the comics in that book are a good summary of what is \*still\* being debated across the internet 30 years later.</div>

Marina Popovich, a well respected soviet Air Force colonel, engineer, and decorated Soviet test pilot, who also holds more than one hundred aviation world records on over 40 types of aircraft over her career, is one of the people who highlighted these images and held a press conference, stating that the Soviet military and civilian pilots had confirmed 3000 UFO sightings and that the Soviet Air Forces and KGB had recovered fragments of five crashed UFOs.
