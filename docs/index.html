                <div class="post-content">Hey everyone 🙂

I’m super confused and hoping someone can clarify what’s going on with Tia-Clair.

Was the Torian her final CrossFit appearance or not? Is she planning to go to the Games this year?

If not, why hasn’t her Games ticket been passed on to the next athlete in line? 
Or did I miss an announcement where she addressed it?

Would really appreciate any info or links if she’s spoken publicly about it? thanks!</div>

My PMS starts 7-10 days before my period and my mood shifts drastically leading up.

If other people aren't affected as profoundly by their cycles, probably sharing is not necessary.

But I agree with your point that communicating your needs is key, however you and your partner establish the method of communication</div>

All the promises about Tesla vehicles taking over the world and justifying the stock valuation are forgotten. Now it's all about the next grift. I don't think Elon cares much about what happens to the original car business.


I do think Trump &amp; co just took advantage of him. Musk might've been serious about doing the DOGE stuff, but it's pretty obvious this administration had no intention of following thru with any even somewhat painful reforms. Mostly ended up being a social media campaign "owning the libs". </div>

Agencies Investigating or Regulating Musk’s Companies Targeted by DOGE

	1.	National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA):

	NHTSA, responsible for vehicle safety and previously involved in investigations into Tesla’s Autopilot system, experienced significant staff reductions.

	Approximately 10% of its workforce was cut, including personnel specializing in autonomous vehicle safety, following DOGE-led initiatives.  ￼

	2.	Federal Aviation Administration (FAA):

	The FAA, which regulates aerospace activities and had fined SpaceX over $600,000 for license violations, saw leadership changes and increased DOGE involvement.

	Musk was granted access to FAA technologies for “rapid safety upgrades,” prompting concerns about conflicts of interest given SpaceX’s regulatory interactions with the FAA.  ￼

	3.	Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):

	The SEC, which had previously settled a securities fraud case with Musk, faced staffing reductions under DOGE’s direction.

      Employees were offered buyouts, potentially impacting the agency’s capacity to enforce regulations related to Musk’s companies.  ￼

	4.	National Labor Relations Board (NLRB):

	The NLRB, handling labor disputes including cases against Tesla and SpaceX, encountered attempts by DOGE to cancel leases and reduce operational capacity.

	These actions could impede the board’s ability to process labor complaints involving Musk’s companies.  ￼

	5.	Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):

	The CFPB, which had received numerous consumer complaints about Tesla, underwent leadership changes and operational shutdowns under DOGE’s influence.

	Musk publicly advocated for the agency’s elimination, aligning with DOGE’s actions to curtail its functions.

	6.	Food and Drug Administration (FDA):

	FDA staff involved in reviewing Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company, were reportedly dismissed during DOGE-led cuts.

	This raised concerns about the impartiality of regulatory oversight for Neuralink’s clinical trials.</div>

They've haranged the comparison in such a way that it fits within the extremely narrow domain in which the LLM operates and then performs the comparision. But of course this isn't how the real world works, and most of the real effort is in identifying which questions are worth asking, interpreting the results, and constructing the universe of plausible questions worth exploring.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Just today there was very nice article on hackernews about articles with AI predicting enzym functions having hundreds, maybe thousands of citations, but articles debunking said articles are not noticed at all.

There is an instituational bias for AI, and for it's achievements, even when they are not true. That is horrendous and I hope we won't destroy the drive of the real domain experts, who will really make these advancements, not predictive AI.</div>

Hi, I’m 17F and started meditating about 8 months ago. Over the past couple of months, I’ve really begun to notice the positive effects it’s had on me, I feel much more connected to myself and the world around me.

I’m in my final year of school, and I’ve been struggling to stay focused on assignments and complete them. A lot of the work doesn’t interest me or feel aligned with who I truly am, but I know I don’t have a choice, I need to finis...</div>

Meditation is accelerating the letting go of your identity as a student, and putting you more inline with your true and future will. But right now, you are a student. And both society and your parents has sacrificed alot for you to be in that role. Could you maybe find the energy to finish that role, for them?

Also its natural to loose motivation at the end of something you dont really care about. You are still a student, but what you feel is probably the changing of identity. Because in one year you wont be a student anymore.</div>

That being said, I still don’t see AI being a huge threat, and I do see it as our quickest means to beat the great filter. I also suspect that life has a natural tendency to fear the unknown, so advertising themselves may not be in the programming.

I think we are on the cusp of having an AI that can seed the galaxy over time. If we can do that, we’ve beat the great filter.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Interstellar colonization by a central power probably isn't that appealing. But space exploration is. Space exploration without colonization only requires sending out enough probes to explore and send back data. We wouldn't find them easily. Interstellar distances are large, but not so large to demotivate it completely. Even we are gearing up to do it. 

If they sent out replicating probes with intent to expand and transform the other star systems, then we might notice it in the case they built vast mega-structures like Dyson swarms. But, we wouldn't easily if they just terraformed or built less extreme scale structures. But even spotting Dyson swarms isn't easy.

We are only recently capable of having a high chance of spotting a technological civilization in our neighborhood, and still only within a small radius, and assuming they are generated detectable signals.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">So I’ve never owned a Stellantis car, but they seem to still command a huge market share here in the United States, despite all the bad things I’ve heard about them.

Why is it? Is it just brand history? Design? Are they like the Harley Davidson of cars and just sell the same products to the same group of users over and over again? What makes someone pick them over GM or Ford?

Personally I don’t get their appeal. I rented a Charger from the airport once and it was so bad within a couple hours I drove back and asked for a Camry instead.  And I don’t like Camrys.

&gt;In the rare event of an accelerator pedal fault, Stellantis has implemented a ‘drive-by-brake’ safety feature, 

In all my years of being a car enthusiast, ever since the age of 3, I've *never* heard of an accelerator pedal fault (not being able to accelerate due to engine fault is different). Is this a thing with Stellantis vehicles?</div>

In this instance, the feature worked as intended, and the driver was able to safely maneuver the vehicle off the road. This feature has been in Stellaris internal combustion engine vehicles for many years and has been carried over to battery electric vehicles.”

LMAO WHAT THE FUCK I was expecting the excuse to be bad, them phrasing it as some evolution of creep &amp; one pedal driving, saying its a safety feature is absurd. Creep is convenient, but conveniently it only happens at pedestrian speeds. Even for one-pedal driving, the default state is slowing you down

And creep only exists due to the nature of ICE, not as a QoL feature, realistically regen is the safer option. I have a feeling they fucked up the creep implementation and are trying to avoid a recall</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The issue here is the rules for what does and doesn't need 60 votes in the Senate. The current reconciliation bill CAN'T be done in multiple bills because of the Senate rules. To split it up would mean each part needs 60 votes and would be blocked by the Democrats, so this is really the only way for them to get around the rules and pass these things without Democrat votes. 

In other words, the hyper-partisan nature of Congress and inefficient rules in Congress is what causes these bills. This is the same for when Democrats are in power as well in which case it's the opposite. Without a supermajority, these kinds of bills become the norm since neither side wants to work with the other for political reasons. Every politician, above anything else, cares only about consolidating power in the next election. They will happily sabatoge the other side if it means they can retake power in the next election.

It's also worth mentioning, that even *within* the parties there are splits in opinion. Ex) Bernie Sanders populism and moderate Democrats on the left, and MAGA and traditional conservative republicans on the right. So even *within* the parties concessions have to be made to get a majority, adding to the size of the bill. SALT deductions for Republicans in Blue States being an example here in this bill, with Red State Republicans being against them.</div>

Each time a nurse or doctor entered the room I asked if I could record … all but one agreed. And there were a hell of a lot of doctors, PAs and various other medical staff checking in. 

I fed the transcripts to ChatGPT and it turned all that conversational gobilygook into meaningful information. There was so much that I had missed while in the moment.

I got a cancer diagnosis recently (prostate, so if you have to get cancer, that's the one you want the wheel to land on) and it was really helpful for my various family members to feed my test results and consult summaries from MyChart into ChatGPT and text my family members a GPT-generated summary of the information that made a layman-readable summary of all the doctor-speak.  I DID double-check the info via Google before distributing but I found no fault with what it generated for me.

I'm sure that there's a ton of medical data in Chat's training data so there's not a lot of reason for it to up and start hallucinating if it's basing it's output on medical records (as opposed to someone asking leading questions that cause it to inadvertently hallucinate in order to give that person what he wants to hear).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It does hallucinate medical stuff in my experience. I've worked as a nurse for nearly 20 years, recently left bedside nursing due to health. One of my teammates advocates feeding most of our work through Chatgpt, "even though it's wrong a lot of the time, it gives you a good idea of where you need to start". 

I've tried a couple times and had it coming up with wild stuff, however a layperson with minimal medical knowledge in the first place may not catch where it's gone off the rails or made something up (a couple of times when I've tried using it to summarise some specifically complicated chart/ procedure, say to defend the billing/coding, it has made things up. like full on citing journal articles or regulatory guidances that didn't exist. When confronted, because I couldn't find the reference it cited, it admitted it didn't have access to any of that material- subscriptions required in at least one instance - and had just created information based on it's 'knowledge of the field ')

I'm glad you're able to get confirmation by researching it before passing it's summaries on and it continues to be accurate. Since health information is private and protected information in a lot countries, idk how much actual real world medical data is in its training though</div>

                                <div class="reply-body"> Epstein was a socialite, his whole schtick was knowing everyone. He made friends with not just celebrities, but policy makers, he made friends with a lot of scientists, anyone with power and influence really that he thought would give him social status. I'm not an undercover Epstein buddy here, but a lot of people came in contact with Epstein in one way or another, without malice. I do think a lot of non-paedos came in contact with Epstein through his parties. It's different being on his flight logs and stuff though, that's when it starts getting a bit iffy. 

They're not the same, but I always thought he had some similarities with Jimmy Savile. They both used their fame and money to their advantage in their own way to prey upon people. It's a defense, by knowing everyone on a personal basis, having fame people can't possibly suspect them of being a degenerate paedo right?</div>

Like 30 year old thermos that's dinged up, peeling paint, maybe weird old stickers, some rust on the outside.

Pour out your creamer into it. Clean it out regularly.

No one is thinking some weird as thermos of mystery fluid is communal. 

The hard part is just doing the cleaning and refilling covertly. You may have to bring it home to do that depending on how nosy they are. </div>
