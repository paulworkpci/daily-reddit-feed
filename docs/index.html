                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly one of the upsides of Grok was that it exposes some of the least informed people on Twitter to real fact checked information. Now it just spins its own narratives with zero evidence. Note that if you chat with the Grok 3 in private it also says that narratives that Jews control Hollywood is a conspiracy. So there seem to be multiple models, one lobotomized for the Elon agenda and one that is capable of freely responding.</div>

I think he'll end up as one of the lesser saints in a future machine-god religion, with thoughts and prayers sent his way whenever a robot dies in an accident involving a fall. Maybe once every half year, a human sacrifice will be made in his name by kicking someone until they don't get back up.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I have both been diagnosed with ADHD and have spent few thousand hours on a cushion.

At first it was very hard, until I relaxed my expecations and realised that this wandering attention is my experience and a large part of my meditation practice is going to be about that.

Another milestone was understanding that meditation is a habit of the mind, of attention, while meditation practice is meant to reinforce this habit in such a way it happens spontaneously. In the beginning you may only willfully direct your attention to return to your object of meditation, but with the right practice, your attention will return to the object on it's own, resulting in calmer, more restful meditation. Practice, practice, practice! And instead of indulging in frustration when you catch yourself "not practicing" (this is practice!), smile consciously whenever your attention returns back to your object of meditation.

Have you tried various concentration techniques? For example, try paying special attention to the gap between inbreath, outbreath and inbreath again. See if you can maintain continuity of attention between them, without losing concentration.</div>

That's one of the dumbest takes I've ever seen on this sub, and that's saying something. Firstly you shouldn't be looking to politicians to solve all your problems. And if they somehow could, why wouldn't you elect them again?</div>

Take love

Any form of the word, many shapes of

So perfect, Hollywood ending

All you need is love, go and ask John Lennon

Love make a man ill, make a man kill

Make a man take a stand making mountains out of ant hills

Stand still, pay attention

Watch love, meet aggression

Man's got his hands on another man's woman

Now that other man's got a gun in his hand, pullin'

Love or die, make a man act high

See a god and Allah ain't scrappin' in the back yard

It ain't hate, it's love that makes us take

Lives away and make dyin' okay

And who am I to say if you should die for love

Love what you have but it's never enough</div>

It all runs via API with built-in context and memory handling to gracefully resume when limits are exceeded.

I plan to open-source this project once I add a few more features.

can’t put my finger on it but lately its doing super dumb things, making new random files, creating new i18n files in the wrong folder, using the completely wrong approach to data fetching,  ignoring all process in CLAUDE.md 

i’ve had a really bad weekend with it and it’s literally made me start my project again for a third time because it’s trashed my approach twice now

i’ve built some great things with sonnet, but opus keeps doing dumb stuff, maybe it’s because i expect more of it?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">UBI is not the endgame of society-under-AI, it a centrist stopgap. With the means of production set to be their own workers, UBI lacks imagination. We stand at a turning point, with two options.

If we allow wealth to continue to flow to the wealthy and ultra-wealthy under AI, then eventually we're going to end up with money and power being circulated back up to the owning class, the workers will be made obsolete, and we'll end up in techno-feudalist hell.

If we don't let that happen by redistributing the wealth, we're not going to end up stopping halfway with UBI. If workers become mostly unnecessary, then eventually so will money, because good and services will mostly produce themselves, and we'll end up in Star Trek Space Communism

There is no in-between. AI amplifies society and amplifies it's feedback loops. We'll either amplify into techno-capitalism, or amplify into techno-socialism. It might take a bit, but we'll end up at one or the other, there is no viable in-between state.

!Remindme 50 years, bet you I'm right or I'll buy you all burgers. Not joking.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’ve iterated on my AI stack a few times now and have finally landed on mostly using Claude and absolutely love it. 

I use Claude code in a terminal inside cursor, and I use Claude web app as well. I am on the 20x Max plan just because of how much I use it and I’ve got a lot of important projects, so both Claude code and Claude web app use opus as much as it can. Essentially I use Claude code 90% of the time, Claude web  app 9% of the time, and then Cursor tab and miscellaneous 1% of the time. The reason why I use Claude web app 9% of the time is it’s just easier to use the web app for a conversation and doing general strategy and architecture and planning, branding, marketing, etc. But also I ran into a couple instances where while Claude code is amazing at understanding the full code base across multiple repos that I am working in, I realized that it’s thinking mostly stays within those boundaries. I actually have needed Claude web app to think outside the repos boundaries when setting up environments or aliases or shortcuts or commands that run system wide, not just in the claude code repo. Hope that makes sense.

Long story short, I’ve tried a bunch of these different AI’s and AI stacks, and I have been nothing short of blown away by Claud compared to the other others.</div>

The problem is only the cost of producing the biologics - and the lack of investment money due to lower profit margins. 

The lack of investment money is also just popularity - NVDA gets to be worth 50 times earnings cause it has a reddit sub. 

It is really hard to call a field stagnant with so many new successful products from the standpoint of saving lives</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The obvious answer, and I know this from years and years of watching Rogan, is that he is very naive and gullible.  He didn’t lie for Trump.  He was fooled by Trump just like he has been fooled by many conspiracy theories and quacks that he has on his podcast.  If he intentionally lied for Trump he would not be calling him out right now.  Joe is not as smart as he and many of his listeners think he is.  He used to say he isn’t married to his ideas but he increasingly is.  Whether it’s vaccines or archeology or you name it, he often thinks he knows more than he actually does.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">At some point though, how well does the "being fooled" argument really hold any water?  I mean, I get it. Rogen is a meathead.  He has the idea permanence of cocaine snorting squirrel and the moral integrity of a rubber crutch. He's found a steady grift he's latched onto it with both hands and, to date, it's worked out pretty good for him.

But when he loses his shit over an inane statement he thinks was made by Biden, only to brush it off when he finds out it was made by Trump, how "fooled" can he really claim to be?  And that isn't the first time he's been fact checked like that.  On air.  In front of his audience.  It really never occurs to him that maybe he should do a basic amount of research and investigation BEFORE he opens his mouth?

I mean, I stopped taking Rogan with any kind of seriousness after he was all in for Bernie in 2016, but then pissed away his vote on a Third Party after Bernie endorsed Hillary.  And here he is, almost ten years later.  One term with Trump and massive shit show that was in the can, talking with and platforming the guy who is literally a convicted felon, an adjudicated liar, fraud and rapist, and attempted insurrectionist.  Lending his voice and audience to him.  Trump gets back into power, starts fucking up as not only everybody said he would but as he himself made every indication he would be fucking up.  And NOW, suddenly, it dawns on Rogen that maybe, just maybe, the living blob of mango pudding might not have been talking straight with him?

Did you really not know, Joe?  Or did you not *want* to know until it got too obvious to ignore or dismiss?

I guess my point is, does Rogan, does anybody at this point, really deserve any kind of a benefit of the doubt?  Rogan may be "dumb", but he's not stupid.  He's had a popular podcast long enough to demonstrate that.  As a popular media personality who's whole shtick is talking about and dissecting popular topics, if *anybody* should have even a passing understanding of who Trump is and some of the shit he's pulled, you'd think it would be him.  But he's really, really that unaware or trusting to *not* cotton on the liar, crook, con-man and thief is...well, a liar, crook, con-man, and thief?  Is the argument really that he's just that stupid?

Or does he just think the rest of us are?

Because, not gonna lie, it's seeming more and more like the latter.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm going to submit the likely unpopular opinion that the progressive road registration taxes in my state (which I DO pay fyi) are unfairly implemented and highly discourage new vehicle sales.

An example:

2025 base Mustang GT: $718.00

2015 Nissan Altima: $62.00

So not only has the Mustang owner paid sales tax on their new car, every year they get kicked in the nuts while the Altima owner basically drives for free. And of course if you have multiple cars (decreasing your road usage) there is no reduction in registration cost to reflect the decreased usage. A shmuck like me is paying $1200 a year for the same amount of road usage as the Altima that clipped the highway worker the other day. I'm not even going to touch the fact that people are driving "worthless" vintage cars worth multiples of my entire fleet and paying nothing for that fact.

TL:DR- You should be paying taxes to your state to support shared resources, but taxation should be at least minimally reflective of real usage. Or if you want to make it progressive, make it based on income and not car value.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’ve got to imagine the vast majority is for tax instead of safety inspections.   The people that can’t afford to get their car fixed for inspection also can’t afford to do this.  Also, currently only 14 states have safety inspections and that number drops to 13 next year so it’s a minority of states.   I could see it maybe sometimes for emissions though

                                <div class="reply-body">The one time I was considering this actually was two years ago when my state enacted emissions requirements that verified tune checksum, which I think is a bridge too far. The car still had cats and all required PCV/ccv/ gas vapor controls, but had a custom tune.

The custom tune was an auto fail on emissions even though actual measured exhaust output per the sniffer test was in spec.

Effectively CARB compliant states all soft-banned custom tunes as soon as they enacted the CA 2021 requirements. I don't think that's reasonable, especially for petrol heads and people that like tinkering. I get where the law was coming from but the effect was anyone with a crazy build could not legally register in a few CARB states. We're talking about maybe 1 in 1000 cars on the road. They did away with sniffer only to save money and nothing more, but custom builds were one of the casualties of this change.</div>
