                    <div class="comment-body">It isn't AGI but it's getting very close. An AGI is a multimodal general intelligence that you can simply give any task and it will make a plan, work on it, learn what it needs to learn, revise its strategy in real time, and so on. Like a human would. o3 is a very smart base model that would need a few tweaks to make it true AGI, but I believe those tweaks can be achieved within the next year given the current rate of progress. Of course, maybe OpenAI has an internal version that already is AGI, but I'm just going on what's public information.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">Multimodality already exists in many models like Gemini so is Gemini AGI?

I also think we're talking about how good the software is around the base model and not the model itself - the integrations it has, etc.

Claude, Gemini and ChatGPT all have a much larger general knowledge than every person on the planet already, and deeper knowledge of subjects than most people.

If you'd asked people 10 years ago if this is AGI they'd have said yes.

People keep changing the goalposts.  IMO what we have now is at least low level AGI.</div>

I’ve gotta say Veo 2 has a sizable lead over sora, but Sora has its own unique take on it, even if more “simple”. Alas, there is more important work to be done. Brilliant work from Veo 2 though.</div>

                    <div class="comment-body">Once this "bleeding edge" AGI becomes compute friendly enough to run mainstream with the same kind of power it has now, we are going to see something truely magic start to happen.   

Software development, engineering, mathmatics, physics, everything is going to start moving at breathtaking speed.

AGI isn't going to take over the world like some people fear.  Instead it is going to accelerate progress in many many different areas of software, science and technology.  It will allow companies and individuals to go from idea to product in seconds instead of years, and for pennies instead of millions.

The jobs of the future won't be low level developers anymore.  The jobs instead will be creative thinkers and creative designers working at speeds that seem impossible, doing things that nobody has even imagined before.  The limit is only what we can dream, and the future is going to come faster than anyone thought it would.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">I don't think this is gonna happen like that. I think we will achieve recursive self improvement before we achieve AGI, or useful AGI. Seems like just like with coding and creative writing, reasoning is easier to do than generalized thinking, meaning we will likely see ML research and agentic self improvement before we figure out AGI, and then a model will smash it's way to general superintelligence. So instead of the slowly accelerating various industries, it will seem like AI is slowing down, then boom, soft ASI.</div>

Llm is not just one entity, it's based on transformers, layering of neurons aka neural network

O series is llm + search algorithm + test time compute.

I don't get people saying , this architecture won't do.

We are already away from basic llms by gpt 4 turbo.</div>

The ARC-AGI benchmarks can be resilient to the effects of data contamination as long as each task continues to be truly novel.</div>

It's smarter than o1-preview, but randomly doesn't think long enough. It often spends less than 10 seconds thinking and then calls it a day, spitting out naively incorrect answers and coding results that that aren't much better than 4o.

Even though o1-preview isn't as smart, it always spends a long time thinking giving the best answer it possibly can.

I think the benchmark results are skewed because of this.</div>

That's EXACTLY where I'm at as well

It's all starting to kinda lose the plot. What are we even really measuring at this point? The classic example use to be an AI that can fool a human. Even the free current models are pretty close to that, let alone o3. Now we have these more 'complex' benchmarks, and the AI keeps demolishing those as well.

So we are kinda at a point where we are playing gotcha by coming up with something it can't do, to claim it's still not AGI. Rather than accepting what it already is, we are just finding random new holes to make some arbitrary point.</div>

We could solve maths entirely and still not have AGI, because AGI is a different thing to extreme skill in specific domains. Obviously that would be massively impressive and groundbreaking, but AGI is a separate thing.

"AGI" is important for different reasons that advancing technology. If you had a sufficiently capable AGI system, you could replace *a lot* of people's jobs. On the other hand, narrower forms of intelligence only affect specific professions.</div>

We are already in that world. Only thing stopping it for 'real world' usage is context limits for bigger codebases.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">Yes! But real world solutions also aren’t some engineer doing a night shift preparing a product out of nothing. Real world solutions are like talking to customer for days cumulatively to get a rough idea of what they want. Then talking to bunch of high level technical people to find out how this can be done within budget and without reinventing the wheel. Then someone writes it down in a form understandable for everyone, then someone else breaks it down into digestible small chunks aka tickets. And devs start working on those chunks. Then multiply everything with 3 because there is a lot of back and forth communication after the development starts all the way from customer to developer including all the intermediate steps. It is a giant machinery. No one human is able to replace all the roles effectively. But I also agree that the AI today is not ready to replace any single cog in the machinery. But we are getting there slowly.
Also it is just unfair to expect todays AI to do all that on its own, because most humans cannot either.</div>

There is a step function change when models can get direct feedback from the environment and operate closed-loop. I've had a little taste of this with agentic cursor + Sonnet 3.6 and it is *great*. o3 in harness will be an absolute beast, and I'm sure Gemini 2.0 Pro and Anthropic's next gen model will also be very strong.

It doesn't have to implement an entire job in one click. Moving to autonomously completing subtasks *with verification* is an enormous step. We will get hours of work done in minutes.</div>

I don't think it's unique to this sub, I think it's across the entire platform.

I think they are optimizing for engagement and controversy.   The types of posts you describe check two boxes "yeah, I agree! Op is me!" And "I hate this...but I have to click to see what these idiots are saying"

I think this because I used to just see nerdy niche posts about my hobbies and top trending news.

Now what I see constantly are what I can only describe as rage bait "articles" and political posts.   I honestly don't care about the latest Elon tweet or trump drama or one more post about how x y or z is on the right side of history.  

I barely recognize what reddit has become.   I've had to mute and show me less x y z more in the past few months than at any other point in my reddit history.   

The worst part is that whenever I do engage in these threads I just try to present some moderate centrist view that would be totally normal IRL and I just get piled on with downvotes and comments that affirm whatever sort of narrative is being pushed.   

I mean seriously what is going on?   Has reddit succumb to the disinfo divisive bots that seems to be invading the entire web or has the user base really just started gravitating to controversy.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/dailymail:

---

A former NASA astronaut has come forward to reveal that he personally witnessed 'two metallic spherical orbs' whizz by his plane this August while flying above Texas.

Leroy Chiao, who served as the commander of Expedition 10 to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2004 and 2005, was 9,000 feet in the air when objects 'zipped' on the left side of his airplane.

He said one flew on top of the other and each was about three feet in diameter.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/RainbowAl-PE:

---

Weeks ago I first witnessed an unexplainable phenomenon in the sky above the Northumberland Strait, and have since been watching intently while recording anything I can. Some recordings have captured huge numbers or 0rbs in single frames, also a larger object apparently emitting dozens of 0rbs at a time. 

Now, I'm beginning to see similar numbers and formations to corroborate what has been until now a seemingly unique experience on my part. These objects are not there every night, nor in the same place twice, and move of their own volition. They are not stars, planes, or satellites. 

I am compiling these for comparison, and hoping imlbe hit the character requirements for a submission statement.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/Tailed_Whip_Scorpion:

---

SS: Montvale, NJ Mayor Mike Ghassali reports that he has spoken with a credible witness whose son attempted to fly his own drone up to one of the mysterious drones. Upon approach, he claims that the drone was "drone-jacked" and disappeared into the sky. He suggests that this is an example of the highly-advanced counter measures that some of these drones are demonstrating.

That being said, I also have experience with GPS jamming equipment the public wouldn't usually be exposed to, and think it's not unreasonable to imagine a consumer drone being equipped with such a thing and causing other drones to go haywire, especially since our own drone intercept technologies oftentimes rely on drones of their own that aren't controlled by humans.

Edit: There's a lot of inferring to do here, but this is a good benchmark of what our military is currently working with when it comes to drone intercept tech

Here's a link to the tweet where I got this. The person who tweeted this, is also the one who recorded it:

[https://x.com/livecrisisintel/status/1870647561696211262](https://x.com/livecrisisintel/status/1870647561696211262)

Since I personally live in a village, with no immediate airport around, I can't vouch for whether or not this is real but I do think that it looks very good- especially the one in the back that just appears out of nowhere! What do you guys think?

                    <div class="comment-body">In the original tweet, the person says that this occurred around 8:40PM and he was somewhere near Budd Lake, NJ. I didn't see them mention which direction they were looking. However, if they were looking *west* they would have seen [four planes lining up to land at EWR](https://imgur.com/7ta9fvO), which is what this looks like.

EDIT: [Here's a video](https://streamable.com/2kdtn1) of the same thing over a larger period of time which should make it even more clear what's happening here. Obviously, OP's video isn't as long, but just watch *how many* planes follow that same "path" of the first I clicked on its approach to EWR.

EDIT2: Go watch the flight track for [UAL1559](https://www.flightradar24.com/2024-12-22/01:42/20x/UAL1559/38701bd5). At around 01:42UTC it makes a left hand turn that would take it *horizontally*, left to right, across the field of view of someone around the Budd Lake, NJ area who was looking west. That's the thing at the beginning of the video that even many folks insistent that these are *not* airplanes acknowledge is an airplane. The others, further away in a line, are:

- United Airlines Flight [1439](https://www.flightradar24.com/2024-12-22/01:41/20x/UAL1439/38705934)

SS: Ross Coulthart's reaction to the Times article that was [shared earlier on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1hj846s/drones_over_uks_american_airbases_may_be/). In a separate tweet, [he reportedly stated that he has been told by his informants that the size of some of these drones/UAP is staggering](https://x.com/MetaStudioLogic/status/1870269599440396436), describing them as "nation state" sized. That certainly sounds a bit larger than the "SUV" description that has been widely reported.

It wouldn't make sense to then assume he is saying that only a nation-state could build them.

There's a lot going on on the ground with everything from helicopters to business jets to A380s as well.


I know the CAA is very keen to collate stats on near misses and have an 'airprox board' that focuses on these, similar to how actual accidents are investigated by the AAIB. 


The aim is to plug gaps in the 'swiss cheese' and learn from it rather than pointing the finger and blamestorming.


Quite interesting to see what happens in a month though.

The photos came from a Twitter account that claimed to be a pilot. It had been created about a month before these were posted and was deleted shortly after. Some details about the story came from another account claiming to have made contact with the original poster. 


The story went that these photos were sent to the pilot by colleagues. ATC had been made aware of the object, sent a vehicle to investigate, and the sphere had at that point shot up in the air.   


There was no metadata with the photos and the one video of the supposed object showed a small sphere already in the air. They were supposedly taken in June.


When a drone was spotted above Gatwick Airport in London a few years back they grounded all flights because of the risk of collision.


This would also have happened in Manchester if there was anything to this story. Some flights were grounded for a few hours one day in June (reportedly because of a fire) but this affected only 2 of the terminals. If there was an unknown object over the runway the collision risk would have shut down all terminals, since they all use that same runway.



So I don't know what this is, but the supposed pilot's account cannot be accurate.</div>

While there are hundreds of sighting of these drones over US airspace &amp; military bases, there have also been several over US bases in the United Kingdom. The news in America coming from the Government is that these are simply hobby drones and commercial planes, regardless of what other sources (such as the Coast Guard) say. Over on The Times website, a U.K. news outlet, they posted an article with investigators claiming to not know what these drones are, or who is in control of them. However they do point out that they are not simply hobby drones due to their sophistication, which contradicts the US Gov &amp; Kirby’s press release. Interesting stuff!

If they were military grade drones, they would need to find the right frequency to jam and disable them. 

After years of conflict, Ukraine has managed to get up to ~70% success rate with EW vs Russian drones.

Drones over UK’s American airbases ‘may be controlled by hostile state’ The unidentified drones use technology so sophisticated that the authorities have been unable to track them, capture them or identify those responsible

Two Cobra meetings have been held in secret after unidentified drones were flown over military bases, involving technology so sophisticated the authorities have been unable to track them or identify those responsible.

Military officials have not ruled out the involvement of a hostile state but have expressed alarm that it has so far proved impossible to find the pilots responsible for controlling the drones.

The Times has learnt there have been at least two meetings of Cobra, the emergency response committee, over the mystery drones flown over American airbases in England. Military police, troops including members of the US Navy and police with drone expertise have been investigating the incursions over RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, RAF Fairford and RAF Feltwell.

Investigators believe the drones were not programmed but were controlled in real time by live operators.

The drones were flown around the bases in late November and early December and varied in size and configurations, according to the US military. The authorities have ruled out the work of hobbyists because of the sophistication of the technology involved and also because the flights were co-ordinated over a series of days.

However, despite the advanced technology available at the military bases, they were unable to track the drones’ signals or pinpoint launch locations. No drones have been captured, which would have allowed their examination, and they were not affected by electronic countermeasures such as jamming.

A Whitehall source said: “They’re very sophisticated, very fast. This is not the work of hobbyists but no one is confident of attribution at the moment.”

On some nights at Lakenheath, where facilities to house nuclear weapons are under construction, dozens of drones were in the sky above the base. British and American intelligence services conducted an intensive investigation that examined whether the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency, was responsible.

A US intelligence source said: “It seemed to us that it was plausible the Russians were behind the flights but it could have been non-state groups. There has been no firm evidence that Russians were involved.”

The first indication that the spy flights might have been Russian-operated came during initial investigations into drone sightings between November 20 and 26 over four bases, including RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire, where four B-52 bombers were deployed as part of an American task force.

Last month a European military source said there was intelligence that the GRU was involved. It sparked alarm at all airbases and airports in the UK.

The US warned that it reserved the right to defend its airbases. “To safeguard operational security, we do not discuss specific protection measures. However, we retain the right to protect our installations,” a spokesman said previously.

The Times previously reported that RAF personnel were using the Orcus counter-drone system to help the US protect its bases. The system can electronically take command of an enemy drone and turn it on itself, to find the operators. The system comprises of various parts that come together to find, identify and track drones. The Ninja — negation of improvised non-state joint aerial-threats — can identify targets up to four miles away.

Yet officials are still unclear about who is responsible for the incursions.

The Ministry of Defence said: “We take threats seriously and maintain robust measures at defence sites.” Advertisement

The mysterious drone activity in England stopped in the first week of December. It was followed by a spate of activity on the eastern seaboard of the United States. Flying objects have been seen over New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland.

John Kirby, the White House security adviser, said on Monday that the drones were a combination of law enforcement, professional and hobbyist aircraft.</div>

                <div class="post-content">James Fox posted this clip from a Former staff member from Senate Armed Services Committee. 

Chilling video clip where the witness describes what he was feeling hearing these first hand witnesses provide detailed accounts that left many US Senators reeling and “in real fear.”

James Fox also gives a shoutout to our Reddit community and says, “Will post full 3 hour link later. Listen to this.”

What are they not telling the public?</div>

It’s about how to tell the population without them calling for punishment of those who hid it. I suspect they were given a deadline to come clean but they don’t know how. UFOs are real. I’ve seen one up close and personal in New Mexico in 2013. I didn’t kill my family or lose my mind with this new revelation either.
