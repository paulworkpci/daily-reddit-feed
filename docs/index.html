                                <div class="reply-body">For me, the bigger conspiracy was how the DNC-friendly media completely stopped talking about and airing footage of a **FUCKING ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT OF THE EX PRESIDENT/CURRENT REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION** because Dems everywhere were panicking about how it was going to cost them the election. 

It was the usual DNC collusion in plain sight and nobody called it out. Bury the story and replace it with the DNC created story: Kamala Harris for President!

Then again, I guess we might have all just grown used to the democrats colluding with their allies in shadowy backrooms to sway elections and public opinion so maybe people just stopped caring……


And to be clear: I detest Donald Trump. But even I realize the ratfuckery going on in front of me. Had that been an assassination attempt on Biden or Obama? Holy shit the liberal media would STILL be talking about it to this very day. They would have covered it until they got the *birds* and *trees* take on that day. </div>

There were UHD cameras pointing at him. You can physically see the bullets wizzing by his head. You think this was acted?

They missed him but hit people behind him. If you watch the videos you would sensibly understand that he would have to be the best actor in the history of the industry to sync up that perfectly with the bullets, sound, and people dying behind him- to “act” like he got shot in the ear in a manner that compelling. 

Forget that. There were numerous uhd photos taken of him and the ear. You can see it. Live. On tv and images. Nothing has even been so clearly documented. 

He did not refuse treatment. He went into hospital and was treated. There is video of that as well. 

What in the world are you reading? Your mind is toxic ooze.</div>

I’ve never coded before — I’ve always worked in theatre and relied on others for anything technical. But when ChatGPT came out, something clicked. I suddenly felt like the tools to create were within reach, even for someone like me with no background in tech.

Over the past few months, I used AI tools (including ChatGPT) to build an app (**My Timeless Journal)** that generates creative prompts and captions from ph...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">So, good job in learning some new skills, it's truly a feat to enter this industry, because web development has grown to be VERY complex.

So complex, that the very thought of a non-developer producing and publishing an app, nevertheless one that accepts personal information + payment information, is unnerving.

Case in point, your app is insecure.

* Your routes are not properly protected; I was able to access /dashboard/ and /profile/ without ever signing up

https://preview.redd.it/qfoqj3ta4vze1.png?width=1265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c93f0b119c23d5da88e4218088cf53902529d34

* I discovered that you use Firebase, found your project information, and uncovered API keys

This information on it's own isn't necessarily a problem, it's not unusual that the Firebase conf is public...but if I can already get this far in 3 minutes, I can likely go much further. Are your firebase rules configured properly to ensure there's no update/write access to unauthorized users? You seem to be using client side auth, and that is prone to JS injection to emulate user creds.

Again, good for you for taking on a new venture, but I think its fairly irresponsible to be inviting users to not only sign up but also even possibly transmit payment info to an individual who really doesn't have the extensive experience to ensure proper security protocols. Just like I wouldn't feel comfortable hiring a "vibe accountant" who'd be handling my personal information, I think this notion of "vibe coding" is incredibly dangerous to users at large.</div>

So good job performing the apparently very hard work of watching a video and passively letting the information flow into your eyes and ears. Since I'm sure you were aware of that since you totally actually watched the video.

But the point is to showcase the contours of what is possible and then he finishes the video by saying he'll release it for $0 if people want to see the final product for themselves.</div>

I'm currently at Uni, I've had a concern for the last couple of years AI is going to take away job potential. I'm pretty sure it will at some point but how long do you feel this may take considering the rapid development of AI and its use in the creative industries. I'm a 3D modeller focusing on hard surface. Have you any thoughts or insights into this?</div>

The OP isn't the guy in the video you probably want to go to [his youtube channel ask him there.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySqLAayNmaM)

I don't have experience with the game industry, but I would imagine that at some point the other shoe is going to drop and employment is going to contract. It's just a question of if it's an implosion or just a gradual process of becoming impossible to get into the industry and then people just kind of don't get their positions backfilled when they leave or get fired. I'm basing that off generic software development knowledge and just a lot of educated guessing, though.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’ll probably delete this but I’m not really a typical Rogan demographic. I’m a middle aged white lady that doesn’t smoke weed or do ketamine or fight in the UFC (although my 7 year old kid does that BJJ :) )

I’d probably be called a libtard or woke or whatever by most people here, which is fine. I also kinda don’t get the issue with the R word until a neighbor moved in and her son has Down’s syndrome. My kid plays with both this kid and his (non/downs) brother. And I can tell you, the mom (who is honestly a really sweet and lovely lady) is extremely offended when people say it. I was joking with her the other day about writing AI scripts- and I told her to write me one that I can play for magas to convert them to libtards (not remembering my audience) and it was like a record scratch. 

I’ve also told her that my husband “spazzes out” when we are late, and she’s asked me not to say that because I guess it’s a slur about epileptic people (?) , one of whom she’s related to. When I tell her I just think of it as using the word “spastic” which I grew up reading lots of fiction novels and that word was used pretty capriciously to describe someone who is wound up, and physically acting herky jerky because of it (think Kramer from Seinfeld). 

Anyway- I’m waving to you from deep blue California where yes people genuinely get offended by these words. I don’t, but I can see why some people do and I do my best to be sensitive to it, but my husband and I tend to roll our eyes about it when we get home.</div>

I like to use these programs to grammar check my posts, and apparently this qualified me to get banned. Pretty ridiculous since I wrote the entire post.

I don't know how to fight this but clearly just banning people when it's next to impossible to verify if you're using AI isn't the answer. Too many studies have shown it's nearly impossible to tell.</div>

Think of all the potential ideas that only failed because the person who came up with it couldn't write a couple of sentences without making a fool of themselves. Now all of them can become job creators (for AI agents, but still) and push us towards a better future.</div>

It doesn't really give any indication or insight into how much of the content of the post is genuinely human-written vs completely AI generated from a basic prompt. I could put this comment through and ask them to just spellcheck it and nothing else and I'm sure ChatGPT would replace the two dashes in here with emdashes. Even if every single word was written by me and they just fixed 2 typoes.</div>

Small percentage of users use em-dash by themselves. On the other hand there is a large portion of AI content that did not use em-dash or it was fixed by a human to remove AI-like terms and dashes.

  
Nonetheless the trend is here.</div>

All the AI talk I hear is them bitching about a bazillion gallons of water that gets wasted, ripping off artists at gunpoint, and ChatGPT lawyers.

I try to bring up Alphafold, MRNA cures, PHDs in a day....crickets.

The only thing I can think to do is spend as much time and money as I can getting in on the ground floor of this shit. Just like every business needed a phone number, then a website, now they'll all need AI Agents. We only have a year to get their business.

Maybe in 5 years I'll meet you people at a convention or something.</div>

Pictures show: 1) DALLE output used to create 3D model 2) 3D model created with TripoAI 3) Animation created with MIXAMO 4) Generated Animation Spritesheet (Blender) 5) Testing in simple Setup 6) Final result gif . Only walking animation implemented at the moment, but it would be no problem to extend on that.

Bringing the older sibling a small gift is nice but not necessary. For the first 30 seconds of the interaction, just be very excited to see the older sibling, greet him/her with warmth, love, and genuine excitement, and pretend the new baby doesn't even exist. This also works great for greeting the existing dog when the family just got a new puppy. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">When our second child was born, we followed some advice given to us by the pediatrician. 

When big brother was arriving with the grandparents to first meet the newborn, we stashed the baby in a rolling bassinet at the nurses station. Big brother and grandparents come in, fawn over my wife, and big brother gets some attention after not seeing his mom for more than a day. 

After a couple minutes of that, conducted without the baby even present, big brother and I head to the nurses station where he gets to be the first one to meet his new baby brother. We take a minute there, and then big brother helps roll the bassinet into his mom's room to meet the grandparents. 

Not only did big brother get a couple of minutes where he was still the center of attention, but he got to meet the baby first, and he got to have some control over introducing the baby.

(Big brother refused to respond to his name for at least a year afterwards unless it included his title, Big Brother. If you just called him by his name without that title, he chastised you.)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You’ve found meditation my friend. Meditation is infinite and what works for others may or may not work for you. Certain types of vibration or sound led meditation can work to help me clear my mind. I’ve found focusing on the simple aspects that I need to work on like compassion, mindfulness, and acceptance to be keys in finding peace in meditation. Meditation for me isn’t getting rid of all thought, it’s homing in on one thought that brings peace. Releasing negative thought is key for me. This is something I still struggle with at times, but when I find what brings me peace in meditation it’s something to strive for. I’ve created my own mediations to release stress and that’s what mindfulness is. Don’t let anyone try to dictate what meditation is for you. I meditate riding my Harley and walking my dog as a form of open eye meditation. Many people think you have to close yours eyes or go blank in thinking to meditate, but not completely accurate. My favorite form of meditation is through following certain sound frequencies and vibrations. The more you focus on sounds and vibration the more quiet your mind will become. Most of my mediations are to singing bowls or even to natures sounds. I love meditating in nature. Closing eyes and using earbuds to block out external sound while I meditated in nature. When I come out of meditation and open my eyes and ears to the sounds of my environment and life outside of me it reinforces how precious all life is</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes indeed OP. Let the thoughts fly unimpeded, watching them without getting involved in any of them as soon as you notice them.

Then gradually you pay attention to your attention. Witness the one who pays attention. Do it while you read this. The one who is aware of your attention. 

Then thoughts don't have any power over you whatsoever. It doesn't matter whether they are there or not. Peace that passes all understanding. Cheers!</div>

"Getting models to reason flexibly across a wide range of tasks may require a more fundamental shift, says the University of Waterloo’s Grossmann. Last November, he coauthored [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02478) with leading AI researchers highlighting the need to imbue models with metacognition, which they describe as “the ability to reflect on and regulate one’s thought process...</div>

We realized we were missing things like modeling intellectual virtues (curiosity, humility), testing outputs across different perspectives, and tracking how well the system handles ambiguity or long-term consistency. so we added light modules for those, virtue scoring, perspective simulation, and a simple wisdom benchmark loop tied into our meta-evaluator.

Nothing super invasive, but already helping on edge cases and tasks with soft goals. just wanted to say thanks!</div>

Do you have some fears about the possibility that the owner of the central LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google) around which your project is developing, may at some point just throw money into these topics and completely reap off the market targetted by your project ?

For example, OpenAI  implemented chain of thoughts with o3 and o4. Could they do the same things with the concepts you mentioned above ?</div>
