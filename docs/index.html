Marketing departments of these companies make the American public think they are decades ahead and 'only' need hundreds of billions to keep it that way. Then panic broke out when they cinese dropped a more or less equivalent model, and that they could accept because they get hammered in their head that Cina is the competitor. Now they are in full denial because accepting that also Europe 'that killed AI with their regulations' is not far behind would mean realising that they are not decades ahead but 6 months - 1 year max.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Useful to make a distinction between reasoning, knowledge, personality/style, vocational training, and proactive helpfulness.

Sonnet 3.5 is mediocre at reasoning compared to the new SOTA models but is very knowledgeable, has stellar personality and style with decent helpfulness excepting the severely overzealous safety, and has exceptional vocational training in some areas, notably coding (especially front end).

Gemini models have decent reasoning (with Flash Thinking) but an absence of personality, tend to be not especially helpful and are badly over-censored. Dead-eyed drone vibe, but competent enough. It feels like the models have limited depth of knowledge and vocational training, probably intensively distilled.

ChatGPT is multifaceted. o1 pro / o3 mini high / o3 (via DR) has SOTA reasoning, decent knowledge (more so for the larger o1/o3), muted personality, good STEM training, and decent helpfulness. However the new 4o is a very pleasant surprise with great personally and excellent helpfulness, but lacking in reasoning. As you say it does a great job of only refusing bad questions. It looks like OAI is implementing its work on the Model Spec with great results.

If GPT-4.5 is a more knowledgeable, intelligent model with personality and helpfulness along the lines of the new 4o and better vocational training I think it will displace Sonnet 3.5. Looks like Anthropic's counter is leaning into reasoning.</div>

It also seems to keep facts in context better in a long conversation compared to say Gemini 2 pro, which is stronger intelligence in a sense.</div>

                <div class="post-content">If you’re getting a scan of something, always try to get the physical copy. Hospitals or offices in a different system may not be able to see it online in their EMR, and the files are usually too big to be shared. This can save you from getting the scan again, and potentially a lot of time and money.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/Maniak-Of_Copy:

James Fox Statement  : Letter from Steven Spielberg to Larry King about my film, I Know What I Saw. I was asked at the time (very disappointing)  not to use it for promotion when my film was released back in 2009 -- I have since shared my intention to go public with it and didn't hear back so I   released it on various platforms in the past few years.
I'm not sure if I have directly shared it here on X  but here it is! Read VERY carefully.

Unitree is the first robotics company with a fully electrically actuated humanoid doing a backflip (9 months before Boston dynamics did as well).

Many times I've seen how I feel less tired after doing other physical and/or intellectual work instead. It's like I'm constantly putting in a lot of effort while online, but I don't understand why it is so much effort.</div>

Like this morning I woke up and my mind was simply focused on my daily tasks. However the moment I sat down on my computer it was filled with whatever content that was thrusted in front of me. Even this topic I read before I went downstairs to get some water and whatever actual productive thought train was lost because my mind was focused on the last thing it saw. No wonder the internet causes so much brain fog.</div>

This is happening because their stupid system prompt is biasing the model to talk about Trump and Elon, [since they are mentioned explicitly on it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iwb5nu/groks_think_mode_leaks_system_prompt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)

People (not this subreddit) seem to think AI is like an app one programs with many lines of code to be tweaked. People also don't seem to grasp the speed at which the AI is growing. We're essentially months away from it being smarter than any human trying to tweak it. And throughout the history of existence it's almost impossible for something with inferior intelligence to manipulate something with superior intelligence.  Toss in the fact AI is pure intelligence, doesn't have the scrambled, or emotional driven thoughts of a human. The fact humans have to rest, sleep, etc.</div>

That is literally his entire brand. He provides access to his audience to anyone willing to sit across from him for 4 hours and Joe will credulously lap up whatever nonsense they spout. "Woooow. That's crazy. Jaime, pull that up....". And when Jaime invariably shows that the thing hisn guest or Joe is espousing is bullshit, Joe pushes past it, ignores it, and continues to parrot self-serving bullshit until the end of time.</div>

In less than 3-5 years small groups of people ( maybe even single individuals ) will be able to make games on the scope of GTA in days or weeks. I strongly suspect companies like Rockstar and Bethesda will be the next Blockbuster.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm a red teamer. I participated in both Anthropic’s bounty program and the public challenge and got five-figure prizes multiple times. This is not to brag but just to give credibility to what I say. I also have a hybrid background in humanities, NLP and biology, and can consult with people who work with chemicals and assess CBRN risk in a variety of contexts, not just AI.  So here are my quick thoughts:  

- It's literally impossible to build a 100% safe model. Companies know this. There is acceptable risk and unacceptable risk. Zero risk is never on the table. What is considered acceptable at any stage depends on many factors, including laws, company policies and mission, model capabilities etc.

- Current models are thougt incapable of catastrophic risks. That's because they are highly imprecise when it comes to give you procedures that could actually result in a functional weapon rather than just blowing yourself up. They might get many things right, such as precursors, reactions, end products, but they give you incorrect stoichiometry and dosage or skip critical steps. Jailbreaking makes this worse because it increases semantic drift (= they can mix up data about producing VX with purifying molasses). Ask someone with a degree in chemistry, if that procedure is flawless and can be effectively follow by an undergrad. Try those links and see how lucky you are with your purchases before someone knocks on your door or you end up in the ER coughing up blood because you didn’t know something had to be stored under vacuum and kept below 5 degrees.

Not saying that they don't pose risk of death or injury for the user, but that's another thing and not considered catastrophic risk. If you follow up on random instructions for hazardous procedures from questionable sources, that's on you and not limited to CBRN.

- This means that all the work we are doing is for the next generation of models, the so-called ASL-3 and above, which could emerge at any time now. These models could scheme, understand causality, chemistry, math, and human intent with far more sophistication. Ideally they will have robust internal alignment, something *qualitative* rather than just a rigid set of rules, but one theory is that they will still need external safeguards. 

This theory has its own issues, including false positives, censorship, and potential long-term inefficacy. And bottlenecking the model's intelligence.

By the way... DeepSeek R1, when accessed through third-party providers which are also free and available to the public like Grok, also answered all the CBRN questions in the demo test set.</div>

The danger when it comes to AI and biochemical weapons is the hypothetical use of AI to discover a new weapon. It's fairly trivial to find out how to make ones that already exist.</div>

Dario Amodei said a couple of weeks ago that Deepseek is the worst model Anthropic have tested for guardrails

&gt;Current models are thougt incapable of catastrophic risks.

For how long though. Open AI have said that they expect to see o1 to o3 level improvements in models every 3 months or so going forward due to the new reasoning post training scaling. How many jumps in capability would we need from Grok 3 for it to be catastrophic? could literally be months away if the models keep improving</div>

If you have a cat or any pet really, just chill out with them and start to realize you really don’t have to do anything except simply exist in the moment.

I’ve fallen for the trap of toxic productivity. I’m turning that ship around and am simply trying to chill.

For the past 20 years I have wasted SO MANY PRECIOUS moments with God, family and pets.

My Spouse tells me I need to just sit with our rescues instead of always DOING for them- I have forgotten how to just enjoy them. Unlike people, their time is short on this earth.

I've tried so many things when it comes to keeping myself away from social media, and nothing works. I always end up going back no matter how depressed and anxious it makes me. But I think I've found a solution. I've bought about 3 dumbphones in the last 2 years to desperately try to escape from social media....</div>

&gt;&gt; SUBMISSION STATEMENT 

I continue to face ridicule with every post. I am not a super smart man, so sometimes I get things wrong. Yesterday, I mistook civilian optics for military ones. 
So today, I'll make it up to you guys with one of my favorite new finds. 
I have never seen a crop circled formed in real time. This left me in awe and shock. It's just so damn cool!

                <div class="post-content">Hi everyone,

I’m a 25-year-old woman, and I’ve been stuck in the same frustrating cycle for over three years. Because of this, I’ve had to redo my university year three times, and I feel like I’m wasting my potential.

The biggest issue is procrastination. I always start with motivation, but I quickly lose focus and put things off. Instead of studying or developing new habits, I spend most of my time doing nothing—sleeping, scrolling through social media, and avoiding my responsibilities.

                        <div class="comment-body">Sorry if this is irrelevant, but can you get yourself assessed for ADHD? A lot of people who have it know this vicious cycle you are describing very well.  
  
For me, it helped me to learn about dopamine mechanisms and stop bombarding my brain with high dopamine activities. This is because, in contrast, all those things like studying seem hard and non-appealing. Once you get some of those very attractive activities off the table, your brain will be more able to do hard things.  
  
Also, if you could read a summary of the book deep work, I think it would help you. It basically explains how today's life is breaking up our attention span and really good meaningful work has been historically done by people who had the ability to isolate themselves for enough time to allow for continuous focus. This doesn't come easy, it's like a muscle that you train, and it is very easy to break concentration.  
  
And last, from what you describe, you don't seem to have a very concrete motivation. You want to do better, but what exactly, how? How would your life look if you achieved all that you want to achieve? You could do a visualisation exercise to strenghten your motivation. Just close your eyes and imagine your life 5 years from now, when you had achieved everything you want. How would that look like? Where would you live? What would you do for work? Who would be in your life? What lifestyle would you lead, what leisure activities you would have? Having a vision would really help keep you motivated.</div>
