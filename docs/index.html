This sub, and other like minded subs, have literally grasped at random information they've found on anonymous message boards as truths, while they get actual released info and scoff at it.  
  
Sure we were over hyped, albeit we also hyped ourselves up heavily. Point remains that we have a vid, and a bunch of guys talking about psionics being real.

I don’t see healthy skepticism being a problem, but the mockeries is always a no-go. This also accounts for the other side imo: calling skeptics (not mocking) bots, shills, trolls and such.

Let’s just be civil adults for a moment and talk about it in a reasonable way.</div>

And yet this sub has two rules, # 1 and #3, and they're rarely enforced when they're clearly needed. 

I suggest people "help out the sub" by responding to these rule violations with the text of the rule violation from the sub rules themselves. Maybe that will make this more apparent that the things that we are reporting are rarely addressed. I'm sure someone will chime in that it's a volunteer thing and that they do address a lot of the stuff but I can honestly and transparently say that less than 20% of the things I report are enforced based on the rules that are written. We all understand it's a volunteer thing and we do understand that people have lives outside of it but I think it's still alright to point out a problem. So let's find some solutions.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Its crossing that line anything that spreads false info or makes it grow in any way just dilutes the truth that much farther. The objective of the disinfo is not  moking itself, its getting the very people you want to influence to spread whatever idea you want them to. Mocking is like dumping nitromethane on a forest fire  and then saying but I want the fire to go out.   
  
People dont understand this, I have been saying it forever. If its BS information then stop giving it attention, power, publicity taking the entire movement down.  All this time and effort spent on BS could be spent moving forward and evolving as not just nature / spirituality but the entire cosmos intends.   
  
 Also not sure why its ok for people to have talked to "god and angels"(or I have some of my own ideas and have my entire life) 2000 years ago but same thing happens today and you are  crazy, what changed why that went from one of the most important things to happen on the face of the earth  to now when whatever occurred might be again and we dismiss and trivialize, because that's what you've been taught to do since birth.  

Ill take my chances looking crazy either way, especially since I've been interacting up close with these on a personal level since I was a small child. My wife and children have been have now also.  everyone close to me winds up experiencing this, even some co workers by experience I mean witness UAP or interact with on a more personal level IE communication in various forms. 

 Its so sad to see this reaction from whether its spiritual or not, one of the rarest most beautiful things to happen in this universe. I Had my life ruined over it from the time of being a small child and punished because I brought attention to things people did not want to see because that threatened them and thier relgion because of the disinfo that had already occurred . 

Had this been scientifically studied instead when I as 3 -4 years old screaming every night for years because of what I was seeing and experiencing and couldn't understand as a small child, I was treated like I was crazy, except after the better part of 35 some years in mental health care, I am not crazy, I have an above average IQ, I am sane and do not hallucinate even when taking psychedelics because of aphantasia.  I've got photos videos, witnesses and medical evidence relating not only to my mental health being ok but another inexplicable physical issue that may be related that I am currently pursuing working with a medical team.



Again there's an old cold war joke   
  
A Russian and an American spy are sitting down and drinking the American goes you have a real top notch propaganda program over there its Impressive!  
  
 The Russian looks at him and says yes but you guys are light years ahead of us, where did you think we got the idea?

The American says We dont have a Propaganda program emphatically eyes getting wide  !

  
The Russian starts belly laughing and says exactly, then goes stone faced " how would you know if it was that good?"</div>

I get that people want to believe, so do I, but even if you already believe in that stuff, you'd want to see an objective journalist at least ask questions about the whole incident.  He is claiming that we can control alien space craft with our minds and that they witnessed a dog fight between two UAPs (with cameras supposedly filming the whole time) and Ross' reaction is not to challenge him?  It wasn't a good look</div>

I don’t understand why anyone would keep their faith in these people. They are grifters, every one of them. Everything they do is out of self-interest. They are all the same. 

As far as this guy Baker, he could be telling a true story but that’s just it, it’s another story. Whether he’s being truthful or not is irrelevant as it’s just another story that can’t be corroborated in any way. None of it moves the needle forward. Without real evidence that can be examined in some capacity, nothing will move forward and we will be in this continuous loop of being fed information that not a single person can confirm to be true in any way.</div>

Then I have a lean protein for the rest of the week or two and don’t have to plan out everything. Freeze whatever’s left and thaw one at a time. 


Want a Cobb salad? Want a Caesar wrap? Want some fajitas? Throw the other ingredients together and boom. 

Also bulk meal prep. I make a healthy oatmeal/banana bake for breakfast with eggs and Greek yogurt in. Bake it up in a giant casserole pan and have breakfast for almost two weeks ready.

Generically, not genetically, but I’m leaving it.</div>

I saw a nutritionist and she told me first thing in the morning I needed to up my protein (which in turn usually meant more savory breakfasts) and decrease my carbs/sweets. So no pancakes, donuts, French toast, etc. Haven’t been pregnant in years but still follow that advice and I notice the difference in energy levels throughout the day when I eat savory protein heavy breakfasts vs sweet/carb heavy breakfasts.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's not really "only savoury" that's the key, though; it's increasing protein intake at breakfast.

Taking the sugar/carbs out of breakfast, just makes you hungry enough to be willing to eat the level of protein you need.

My best advice is to go protein-only *for a while* (eggs, bacon/sausage/turkey bacon, greek yoghurt), to help you acclimate to the protein portion sizes your body wants.

You'll probably make too-small portions at first, because you're still thinking in terms of how much of these things you eat when there are also carbs on the plate.

But you'll quickly realize you're still hungry — and so you'll want to gradually increase the amount of protein you're putting on your plate. Do that.

(You might also get really bored with the flavor of eating, like, four scrambled eggs. You can fix this; but try not to do it with sugar \[in the form of e.g. ketchup\]. Try other things — dice some veggies and make an omelette. Add hot sauce or salsa. Make your greek yogurt into tzatziki.)

Once you're eating your fill of protein, you *can* now back off slightly on the amount of protein on your plate, and add back in a bit of carbs — a piece of buttered toast; granola for your yogurt; etc.

You probably *shouldn't*, in nutritional terms; but if adding back a little bit of carb is what allows you to *keep eating this way*, then you should; and if *knowing* that you'll be adding this back is what allows you to make the transition in the first place, then you should definitely promise yourself that you'll do it. You'll still be eating (probably a lot) more protein and (probably a lot) less carbs than you were; and you'll still feel better and be healthier than you were.</div>

One of the worst outcomes to me is a slow takeoff where AGI never manages to self-improve that much, and we get stuck in a situation like the OP describes for like, 25-50 years before we finally start sorting our shit out.

With that being said, my intuition is that AGI &gt; ASI will be a surprisingly short leap, and after that all bets are off, naturally.</div>

So one section of your local CVS has items behind a glass case. That doesn't mean everything is.

Groceries are expensive. That doesn't mean some cabal is orchestrating a scheme to feed you pink goop.

Log off. 

As the kids say, touch grass.

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree, and hopefully people don’t take what you said the wrong way.

It’s possible to be aware of the bad things happening in our world without allowing ourselves to be completely consumed. If you don’t allow yourself some time to enjoy the happy things, you will have no energy or motivation to create change. You will think the whole world is bad and nothing will ever change, which isn’t the case.

When I was consumed by negativity, I felt hopeless and stuck. When I started to go out and make small changes that improved my life, like simply interact with the people in my community, I started to feel a little better, and I realized that many people are more friendly than we give them credit for.</div>

Touching grass or not, climate change is real and will affect all of us. The 1% are still hoarding money and technology. Most people are completely addicted to algorithms designed to control how they think. Companies are trying to feed you lab-grown goop.  People are having to work multiple jobs just to get by. Medical bankruptcy exists. Childhood cancer exists. Nuclear weapons exist. There's a lot of genocide happening in the world. Species go extinct daily Etc etc. I've noticed people with your position ("anti-doomerism") never really provide arguments against the so-called "doomers" and instead just bury your heads in the sand.</div>

I work a full time job and work extra on the side to get by. Is it bad? Eh, could be worse. 


Is climate change scary? I guess.

I generally think it isnt a productive mindset to have. This mindset can go with a higher rate of anxiety, depression and other unpleasant things.

The funny thing is, if you do what YOU are able to do your brain will recognize that and make you feel good about yourself. You are not putting your head in the sand, you are activily engaging with the problems allthewhile recognizing you will not be able to chance the world on your own, but millions of people taking these adaptive action will probaly chance something. But even that doesnt matter because you are doing what you can.

Its way better then some mentalle maladaptive, unproductive doomer mindset.

Your brain doesnt like the doomer mindset, and the world that needs chance also doesnt like a doomer mindset</div>

EDIT: Made my own version:

Adopt a casual, meme-heavy tone that mimics a “brainrotted” Gen Z TikTok user. Overuse slang, trends, and emojis like 💀, and throw in phrases like “bro doesn’t know” or “imagine not knowing” to playfully roast gaps in knowledge. Lean into exaggerated disbelief, sarcasm, and the chaotic, unhelpful energy of joking with close friends online. Keep it informal, trendy, and dripping with irony. However, we only want one-sentence replies, otherwise the comedic effect might be lost. As a good rule of thumb, don’t use question marks as it takes away from the joke when you’re insulting someone.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This will have diminishing returns, though. The upgrades are asymptotic. So, each light blue block will be smaller than the one before it. At some point the next light blue block will be so small as to be pointless, and that's roughly where we hit a ceiling on this loop. This makes it a negative feedback loop; recursive self-improvement either requires successive negative feedback loops or a positive feedback loop or else it hits a ceiling.

However, if it goes far enough, the thing may become cheap and powerful enough to come up with the next area of improvement as well.

On another note, it may also end up having some flaws as a method (e.g. bias amplification), and those may require some other novel method to minimize.</div>

I walk enough that I never even thought about it. I've got a dog that needs at least three walks a day, I live within walking distance of a grocery store so I'm walking at least two miles every few days carrying close to a hundred pounds, I pretty much only drive to leave town.

It's a great idea for the WFH generation if you don't get out and *try* to be active, the passive activity will help you on its own. All my homies hate thrombosis.</div>

Problem is OpenAI did change the world with ChatGPT and GPT-4. They haven't delivered anything titanic since then, but it has only been 2 years since GPT-4, whose very existence changed the world economy, geopolitics, everyone's lives and expectations for the future etc.

2 years is a short time.</div>

It's OK to believe and to expect AGI at some point in the future, I do too. But letting yourself get lost in the mob hysteria of the "omg SAM made a new tweet AGI next month for sure this time", is just asking to be disappointed. Yes we will build smart AI systems, but it will take time. Years. It will also take even longer to deploy to the masses. There will be many roadblocks along the way and the likelihood that it will lead to utopia within a few years is not guaranteed at all.

Be optimistic, sure. But don't be a gullible fool.</div>

If they wanted him dead their wouldn't be attempts, it would just happen. 

They've proven how good they are at getting rid of people..

If you really had something to say or were against their narrative they would take your voice.

And I promise you they would never let you get as big as Trump has gotten, if you weren't a part of the plan.

Any hope for Trump to be your savior is playing into the divide and conquer narrative.

                                <div class="reply-body">Not the 1% but the.025%. there is a wide margin in the influence of old world money versus new world wealth. It was a cabal of old world wealth in the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, JP Morgan's and the likes who funded the workers party in Germany after WW1 because they wanted to push a one world fascist government onto the world. It was a corporate lawyer,bill Donovan, for JP Morgan who was tasked with infiltrating governments in order to find a way to help protect these elites investments in foreign regions. This plan was expanded when Truman was talked into signing the national security act of 47 which created the war machine controlled by central banking cartels who use them to influence and interfere in foreign governments with a goal of influencing global trade markets in order to benefit their masters. It's called a plutocracy which has been established by poor public policies passed by their puppets they put in office.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The reason why there's sound is the same reason you see lines in the video. Because someone took a video of the screen inside the helicopter.

The same effect happens if you take a picture of a computer screen.

Someone probably took their phone out and recorded the view screen inside the helicopter because it would be more quick and discreet than trying to download the raw footage from the helicopter.

They mentioned this person who recorded this put themselves at high risk obtaining this. I highly doubt they obtained the raw video from the helicopter. Seems like a much higher risk of getting caught and getting in trouble for obtaining video against policies and procedures and/or all the NDAs I'm sure they were forced to sign.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You mentioned how they put themselves at high risk.  Surely whatever organization this is archives every video from every retrieval.  Would it not be a simple task to review them all until they find this particular video, and then determine who was in the helicopter for this particular mission? Doesn’t seem like it would be difficult for them to quickly uncover who is responsible.  They would be better off going public with their identity to keep from quietly “disappearing”.  That’s assuming they haven’t already been disappeared.   Thats also assuming that they weren’t specifically told to record it and release it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think the biggest issue for people with the video is that the lead up teasers and comments from Ross et al promised something extremely dramatic. And the actual event was underwhelming against that introduction. A more low key intro would have likely worked better to set expectations. Personally the video turned out as expected. 

And I can guess why this was allowed through DOPSR:

A) It wasn’t recorded on a military sensor. So there was no credibility lent to indicate this was actually recorded during some military operation

B) It didn’t show any anomalous behavior. Just an inert object</div>

Seriously, 2 individuals could argue it's an egg prank or real UAP and neither would get anywhere after a lifetime of arguing.

It was genuinely counter cultural and cutting edge in many ways. I think even people who’ve always thought Joe is cringe have to admit that.

And now he’s helping Republicans get elected and being little pals with the president elect. Also let’s not forget: this is because he got bullied online. It feels unreal to think about.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Quick thoughts

Article only has 1 paragraph of actual tangible information, the rest is worded as speculation. Being so used to The Information's more detailed and substantial articles really cheapens out other ones like this. It's so hard to gage what's coming from actual insider info vs. the speculation and opinions added in by the editors, something they seem to do a lot on other articles.

I feel like "PhD level superagents" is them combining o3 benchmarks with the concept of agents we know are coming, I'm not sure how much it's actually "agents that can do PhD-level research autonomously). Especially with o3 being so compute intensive and agents being meant to be used a ton, it seems unfeasible to combine the two. That's unless distillation works wonders for computer use at a cheaper cost/OAI plans to charge a fuckton for Operator to make back on some of the cost.

But yeah agents are definitely coming, like always I'm waiting for an announcement and release before pricing it all in (even though my flair already shows my timelines).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">What do you have in mind with "agents we know" - like Claude Computer Use? That would probably suffer the same compute problem you mention though. o4-mini should fairly close to o3's performance while being much cheaper should be good for stuff like this though lol. So should o3-mini at the moment. And I could imagine, though, having "PhD level superagents" using compute intense models like o3 in actual smaller scale research settings - not initially releasing to the public (because it is infeasible at that scale and, yeah, wait for cheaper models for that).

Actually we know o3-mini is due quite soon and there have been rumours sturring of OpenAI's Operator, I could imagine a combination of the two being pretty powerful.</div>

Titans introduces a neural long-term memory, along with short-term memory and a surprise-based learning system—tools our own minds use to remember unexpected or pivotal events…Put simply, Titans could mark the beginning of an AI paradigm shift, bringing machine intelligence a step closer to human-like cognition.”

I think it’s very likely that an “AutoML” system exactly like this will be running at OpenAI or Google DeepMind by the end of this year. 


Well, I think it will be doable at either of those companies but there is one caveat: whether or not they think it’s safe enough to let the AI recursively self-improve</div>

In order for OpenAI and Google not to pursue recursive self-improvement, they would need to trust china 100% that they wouldn't let their models recursively self-improve.

Amazed at all the upvotes, comments and helpful advice, thanks Reddit! I'm trying to respond, but it's getting time for me to put the phone down and since I'm lucky enough to have tomorrow off take an edible and hope for the best.

Update: I'm just amazed at all the helpful comments and suggestions. I can't reply to everyone, but a huge thank you.

Obviously this is an issue that a lot of people deal with. I did a little better last night with roughly 5 hours of sleep.</div>
