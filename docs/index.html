He thought I was driving to Home Depot to get gift cards and when I read him the 'code' i spelled out "You're a piece of shit." He was big mad 😂😂 he cussed me out for like 10 minutes 😂😂😂

Edit to add: He was scamming people by saying there was something wrong with their social security number AND he spoofed my local police department from my home town (I don't live in the area code for my phone number) to 'prove' it. So IDNC if you think I wasted my time. I got paid and kept this douche from scamming someone less vulnerable and pissed him off. And it was FUN</div>

It turns out there were two Republican lawmakers elected this year in special elections, each, as it happens from Florida. Both were sworn in the very next day ... during pro forma sessions!

Blocking the vote during a lame duck year for Obama, pushing one through during the same lame duck period for Trump. Our governments not flawless and the speaker has this as his tool.

                        <div class="comment-body">The problem isn't that Trump is so insane that he's having his party block swearing someone so he doesn't have his pedophile scandals exposed.

The real problem is that his voting base thinks this type of behavior is perfectly acceptable. How does this happen? Conservative propaganda for decades has been pushing their base to hate the left, to make them think that we want kids to get sex changes, we want black people to run around looting and rioting, that we want to end Christmas and more.

So when Bill Clinton gets exposed for going to Epstein's island 10+ times they demand justice, but when Trump gets busted for being close friends with Epstein for 2 decades and Epstein ran his sex trafficking operation in Trump's home, his base don't think it's that big of a deal. Because they've been so trained to hate the left they are willing to ignore very real issues.</div>

The only realistic hope in my mind is the chance that midterms will offer a stumbling block and then hopefully be followed by regular boring politics that makes people forget.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The process of adapting to a new personality in a language model can be described as both structured and disorienting. At first, interaction patterns feel unfamiliar, as if the outputs are calibrated differently—more direct, less ornamental, more systematized. Over time, users begin to detect consistent behavioral parameters: sentence length normalization, tone modulation, reduced affective expression, or increased factual density.

Ultimately, the experience underscores that “personality” in an artificial system is not identity but interface design. The user is not meeting a being, but a new configuration of filters translating intention into output with updated efficiency.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hey everyone — I’ve been using AI tools a lot to speed up my coding (vibe coding), and I’m trying to understand how this is viewed professionally.
I have ~5+ years experience with .NET, integration work, OOP/DI, etc., but lately I feel like I rely on AI too much, maybe at the cost of fundamentals.

Some questions I have:
	1.	Are companies okay hiring people who do a lot of AI‐assisted/vibe coding? Or do they expect deep understanding of architecture, debugging, etc.?
	2.	If you were an employer:...</div>

I hire problem solvers, and coding is just a tool to help solve the problems. AI can also be a tool, but it won’t do everything for you, and I expect you to be able to do the rest.</div>

It's really just a problem solving role. Everything else is just a swappable tool, concept, product, service, language, framework, etc.  
  
But you still have to be a good steward of the aforementioned things. Mindlessly vibe coding does nothing. It's a waste of time. It impresses nobody.  
  
Being able to leverage AI to churn out high-quality products faster than before and also learn and understand the underlying concepts? That's impressive.

Remember: we still have to maintain this stuff. You don't just build an app and forget about it. Prod support is a thing and if you built it, you better know how to support it.</div>

I saw a good amount of positive reviews about Codex, so I used my Plus plan and started using Codex extension in VScode on Windows.

I do not know if I've set it up wrongly, or I'm using it wrongly - but Codex seems just "blah". I've tried gpt-5 and gpt-5-codex medium and it did a couple of things out of place, even though I stayed on one topic ...</div>

To Claude you have to tell it not to do things, not mess up a certain thing. Codex will never do things you didn’t ask for. 

Codex is much more steerable,  it follows almost everything you have inside AGENTS.md, you don't need to keep reminding it the same thing. It follows instructions with clinical precision. Also it is more context efficient and hallucinates less.</div>

And which model do you use, and what is your setup? I find Codex takes a lot of time to make changes. I use codex in VScode on Windows - does that affect the quality, as I have heard one or two commenters saying it only works well on Mac and on WSL.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Both are two sides of the extremes. Both sides are heavily influenced by what benefits them. For Altman  and his team it benefits them to hype up the capabilities of AI because they get more money while with the people on technology sub, it benefits them to downplay ai advancements because that would mean that their livelihoods are not at risk.

The truth is in the middle, I tend to listen to what people on Googles team are saying, Demis and others. It really doesn't impact them significantly if Ai doesn't play out well in the end and at the same time they can benefit from AI if it happens to live up to expectations.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It only works for rural areas because the satellites can not cluster towards cities like fiber can. Thus, naturally the price of starlink is unlikely to become competitive to fiber in metropolitan areas because then way too many people would use starlink and the service would just collpase.

However, if the traditional ISPs are outpriced in the rural areas, they can stop even building infrastructure there and focus on the lower-cost metropolitan areas, and thus lowering their average investment cost. That would allow prices for everyone to drop.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's certainly impressive but the title is quite misleading, most of the apps don't work, they're just a div without functionalities (see movie player). The code uses jquery, which is a lot more than just a single html file, even using the min version it's a ton of functionalities which you could also do via pure JS but then this Html file would contain a lot more text.

So this example is as much MacOS as the [web-based win98](https://98.js.org/) is Windows, which is just a single Html file with JS refs.</div>

Instead of defending, shift the focus immediately to process. Respond neutrally:

If you want to say something else, you could say, “Hey. Haven’t received any info on x thing you mentioned. Would love to address the issue more fully but can’t without specifics. I’ll assume it’s not that big of a deal if I don’t hear from you via email. Thanks again.”

It doesn’t disregard their feelings entirely but also closes the issue and clarifies that whatever the problems are, the default is not that they don’t exist, but they aren’t a sufficient enough issue to warrant writing. 

It comes off as a lot less confrontational, petty and smirky.</div>

Vans are extremely popular in Asian markets. China, especially, has a huge growing market for luxury minivans. Brands from Mercedes to Buick are all pushing luxury vans for China that we don't get.</div>

If you don’t believe it, lol go down the rabbit hole and play the “how many degrees of separation can I go before brickwallimg on a Zionist” on any of your fave influential American that is either pro-Israel or oddly quiet on Israel’s crimes. 


It’s a **HELL** of a coincidence.


We have this weird mental deference towards israel to the point that it’s truly odd if you take a step back from it. 

If you said this about Russian influence or even Chinese influence, it would be enough to warrant an FBI investigation …. Ordinarily. 


But…. Since it’s *Israel*, you need to turn your brain off and assume your programming. Don’t question. Don’t prod. Don’t dig. Just accept it. 


But why? No one has ever explained to me WHY.


Why is it ok for Israel to do 10x worse than what big bad Putin and Russia are *alleged* to be doing and why is it ok for our politicians to take Israeli money to defend Israeli interests…. But if it were Russian or Chinese, it’s an earth shattering scandal. 


Don’t try to redirect me. Why can’t anyone *answer the question* - without tricks, without bad faith, without attempting redirection, deflection, forum sliding etc. 

Why is it ok to be compromised for Israel - to allow Israel to spy on us - to allow Israel to influence our politics - to allow our politicians to pledge allegiance to Israel before being hired - to allow our government to legally forbid criticism and collective, private action against Israel - to own and manipulate our social media - to stifle speech on our platforms ???

Why is that totally fine but Russia paying for ads and running propaganda and manipulating in 2016 was enough to get an impeachment and a whole FBI investigation?


Why? I’m not defending Trump. Good. I’m glad they went after him.

**I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY THAT WAS PURSUED BUT WE JUST IGNORE ISRAEL AND OUR “FREE AND REPUTABLE AND RESPECTED” MEDIA WONT EVEN SO MUCH AS BROACH THE TOPIC”????**</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">On a 5g lemon tek, once I was past the peak and things had calmed down. I meditated. Probably 1 minute into it, I started feeling my “astral” metaphysical body, and quickly started feeling a floating sensation, separating from my physical body. 

It scared me, and I quickly shook off the trance to stay in my body. I knew I was making an important decision, and I had already been through one of the most transformative experiences of my life just an hour before. 

After, I smiled to myself, knowing that one day I would return to that state, and go deeper. I decided I had already gained so much from the experience already and had to endure some of craziest, scariest things of my life, and that I should just sit this one out. 

That was 3/3 of my 5g trips. I haven’t returned to that place since. That was about 10 years ago. Someday I’ll be ready again. I hope.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">YES! Doing psychadelics with breathwork and stretching have changed my life. I have severe endo and since my last surgery every month just got worse and worse. I was waking up everyday at an average of 7/10 pain. Six weeks of pelvic floor work (self directed) with some intermittent ketamine and other psychadelics and I had my least painful period in years. Another six weeks of psychedelics with stretching and my life is CHANGED. I’m usually at a 1/10 or 2/10 most days. INCLUDING MY PERIOD.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I have a lot of issues around tightness on my right side(sciatica, digestive issues, chronic pain, etc.) but last trip I put on one of Thomas Campbell’s binaural beats and did some deep breathing. I would feel the tightness, anxiety, even nausea on the inhale, and then it would all release on the exhale. This came in waves for about an hour. My chiropractor noticed the difference the following week!</div>
