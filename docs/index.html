We could have had a world where we have more than enough. However we aren't allowed "enough" we have to consume.

We could have universal basic services or universal basic income and it's going to be the UBI that wins out. They don't want to use the AI to give us enough. They want consumers to be able to spend money. This conflict is going to lead to more wars than Facebook enabling the Rhoyhinga genocide.</div>

Now more recently, Jetta sales are down while Tiguan and Taos continue to go up. Probably the end of the line soon for small gas VWs.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The normal golf was definitely in a weird spot in the USA market. It was one of the most expensive, if not the most expensive in its segment. Anyone who cared about driving was very likely to just buy the GTI or R. But, people who just wanted appliances probably wanted the bigger and cheaper Jetta or a similarly priced crossover. I think a MK8 alltrack shouldve been imported though, mk7 alltracks are still very desirable in subie dominated states like colorado.</div>

The first week was awful. I felt bored and edgy, and overwhelmed by silence. But around day 10, something shifted. I stopped craving the scroll. I had actual mental space.

                                <div class="reply-body"> Epstein was a socialite, his whole schtick was knowing everyone. He made friends with not just celebrities, but policy makers, he made friends with a lot of scientists, anyone with power and influence really that he thought would give him social status. I'm not an undercover Epstein buddy here, but a lot of people came in contact with Epstein in one way or another, without malice. I do think a lot of non-paedos came in contact with Epstein through his parties. It's different being on his flight logs and stuff though, that's when it starts getting a bit iffy. 

They're not the same, but I always thought he had some similarities with Jimmy Savile. They both used their fame and money to their advantage in their own way to prey upon people. It's a defense, by knowing everyone on a personal basis, having fame people can't possibly suspect them of being a degenerate paedo right?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Anybody familiar with The Finders, Comet Pizza, Dutroux or the Franklin Scandal already knows why. Asking the government to affirm this shit is stupid for those reasons.

For anybody not in the know: the intelligence agencies of the US government both profit from, and actively facilitate, the sexual slavery of children. There are sex trafficking rings all across Europe and the United States which actively facilitate this shit in exchange for money and counter-intelligence.

Epstein was a mossad agent (self-admitted to one of his rape victims) that was working with the CIA and had connections to numerous banks, a major lingerie franchise and industry leaders. But all things being likely, he wasn't the only ringleader that existed in this fashion.

The reason why Dan Bongino and whoever else isn't openly acknowledging this is simple: everyone in the political class of the US is complicit. 

The only reason why you, I, we are allowed to talk about this is because we exist in the providence of the superstitious and schizophrenic. We are protected because nobody takes us seriously due to how much of a dirty word "conspiracy theorist" is.</div>

He is the one who stole the photos and edited them without giving credit. Unless you expect elon musk to do a reverse image search on everything he replies to on Twitter then this isn't on him.

And to preserve my reddit karma: elon bad.</div>

When you signal boost at that degree, you have a greater responsibility. He basically has the reach of a news outlet. As a society we can either move to reduce his reach or impose higher standards on his communications/messaging.


It is a mistake to impose "friends joking around, watching the game" standard of information vetting onto elon sharing stuff on Twitter.

Imagine if we're in a street, there's a cool cat and I pet the cool cat. I then say "I love my cat, he always loves pets". You'd immediatly make the connection that this cool cat is my cat. Or it would be the same if I took a photo leaning on a super expensive car, saying I got a new car.

My bet is :

- 20% a part of the world live with a basic income based on a tax on robots and AGI, but life will not be a luxury for most

                <div class="post-content">Once upon a time, CrossFit was real simple. You showed up. You suffered. You left.

There was usually one workout. Occasionally a strength lift. Maybe a mobility stretch if someone remembered where their hamstrings were and could conjure up a reason to stretch at all. But then someone somewhere said the cursed words: 'What if we added a little bit more?'

Suddenly, one WOD a day became strength + metcon. Then it was strength + metcon + accessories. Then bodybuilding finisher. Then morning Zone 2...</div>

There’s always a few who do way more than they should, but population pales in comparison to those just trying to get a good workout and move on. If you are in the small bubble group, you probably just feel like that’s what everyone else is doing cause that’s your bubble. It’s the same at every gym.</div>

Far too much truth to this. CrossFit was once a place of community and fitness and wellness. Now it’s more competitive and comp prep and spending tons of money on recovery items.</div>

- tends to bloat code with over engineered structure which can fuck you up down the line, and also eat up your token limit

- May add unnecessary funtionality which will also eat up your token limit

Also why cost is an issue if you are using Claude pro? It cost similar to chatgot or Gemini pro.  I have it stop me only once because I was asking crazy changes in a very long code dozens of times.


Yes for pro subscription, you need to use web or app, but honestly even in copilot, I use chat interface mostly, and pro system prompt is far better than whatever MS is using in co-pilot, which is restricted to coding and dumba down Claude.</div>

Claude 4 is by far the best at generating focused code. I estimate I have to edit the output only 20% of the time compared to like 0% before. Are you thinking of Claude 3.7?</div>

Like 30 year old thermos that's dinged up, peeling paint, maybe weird old stickers, some rust on the outside.

Pour out your creamer into it. Clean it out regularly.

No one is thinking some weird as thermos of mystery fluid is communal. 

The hard part is just doing the cleaning and refilling covertly. You may have to bring it home to do that depending on how nosy they are. </div>

They've haranged the comparison in such a way that it fits within the extremely narrow domain in which the LLM operates and then performs the comparision. But of course this isn't how the real world works, and most of the real effort is in identifying which questions are worth asking, interpreting the results, and constructing the universe of plausible questions worth exploring.</div>

There is an instituational bias for AI, and for it's achievements, even when they are not true. That is horrendous and I hope we won't destroy the drive of the real domain experts, who will really make these advancements, not predictive AI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The fact that this sub is so preoccupied with posting benchmarks, tech CEO Tweets, and research claiming that AI can do something, suggests that what AI is currently doing isn't as impressive as people like.

Imagine I tell you I can do 20 pullups. You ask me to show you, and I say, "her, talk to my friend, he knows I can do it. Or look at this certificate, it's a certificate saying I can do it. Here's a report from some doctors, where they studied me and said that they think I can do it" - and I keep not showing you the pullups.

And then you say, "look, if you're not going to show me the pullups, I'm not going to believe you," and you get swarmed by people saying, "OMG, head in the sand much? You're going to just ignore all this evidence and all of these experts like that?!"

I don't really see the point is people continuously claiming that AI can do something, or benchmarking it - show us what it can actually do. If it can do the job better than researchers, then do that, and show it to us. If it's going to be writing 90% of the code now (like Dario Amodei claims it should be able to do now), or do the job of a mid-level software engineer (as Zuckerberg was claiming it would this year), then show us.

It's about giving human experts and test models the same set of research ideas to evaluate. It's not about bruteforcing or how much ideas an AI model can iterate over in  a given timeframe.</div>

If AI is truly 100 times smarter than us. Then technology will be infinitely better. Our economies are built to tackle scarcity. An ai that intelligent would quickly make scarcity obsolete.

I have two issues with this though. 


1. how is babysitting an AI a "better job" than many of the jobs we have now?

                        <div class="comment-body">Take food for example:

When humanoid robots catch up and work better at tasks than humans, food production costs will plummet, and prices will plummet. Companies producing food can’t keep prices the same or price gouge, because their competitors who have access to the same robots will lower prices to capture market share. It will be a race to the bottom. 

Now the frozen pizza at the super market costs $0.29 cents because: a robot assembled it, a robot drove the truck to deliver it to the supermarket, a robot stocked it in the shelves, and the human used self checkout. 

All of a sudden food is incredibly cheap or basically free. Everyone’s income just went up because our monthly food budget went from 1000 to 100. 

Multiply this by every industry. I think a lot of the UBI will come in the form of drastically reduced commodity pricing across various industries.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That is the ideal outcome but first.

- corporations producing food and running farms will initially have no incentive to reduce prices when production costs plummet, rather they will reward shareholders.

- Now you need a way for new companies or organizations to compete in these markets which is difficult with the capture of farmland by corporate farms and lack of saturation of small grocery stores in the era of big box stores and major chains.

- Then you need those who own those new competitors to be altruistic enough not to sell to the major corporations and cash out and stave off any hostile takeover attempts if they go public.

While I agree that post-scarcity in essentials is the end result, it will be a painful road to get there because those who produce and sell our food currently are driven solely by short term profit and automation just means a bigger piece of the pie for shareholders, not cheaper pies for consumers.

Covid provided us some insight into this.  The pressure to reduce prices to compete is no longer what it once was and after covid ended as well as when inflation came down there wasn't sufficient market pressure to bring prices back down while there was plenty of pressure to cut bigger checks to shareholders.</div>

It feels like that's the one area where Gemini hasn't quite caught up, although it feels like Google's ahead in having an overall huge model with a more fleshed out knowledge base.

The Claude Deep Research feels like it's on another level compared to OAI and Gemini though, after using it for a few days.</div>

Yes, you can troubleshoot ice makers- but it’s usually more hassle than it’s worth. Just buy a new unit ($45-$90)
