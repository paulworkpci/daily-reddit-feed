It's less costly on their end to just do the check, but it's also not an elegant way to implement it compared to the way ChatGPT implemented its guardrails where it's woven INTO the bot to watch out for various things.

It makes it obvious but damn is it depressing to see it being done right in front of us lol</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/TommyShelbyPFB:

---

&gt;***Provocative and controversial as the claims are, the film-makers left the question of next steps to the audience, with an explicit call to demand more information from lawmakers they say are also kept in the dark. “Push your representatives, push the executive branch, push the president to make this come to light, make the transparency happen, so the world can understand what we’ve been dealing with is real,” said Stratton. “We are not alone.***

Don't forget at the end of the day it's still up to us to make transparency happen, to get the evidence out. Nothing will be handed to us unless enough people make it clear that enough is enough.

Ignore the pessimism it's a waste of time. [Call your reps](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) and make sure they are working to get the [UAPDA](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/senate-amendment/2610/text) re-introduced and passed.

They are certainly trying to experiment on the personality of the model, but above all on improving that aspect that is difficult unlike deterministic domains.

I think this is the point, improving the logical abstraction of the model since it seems they are making great progress on predetermined domains such as STEM ones</div>

All kidding aside, a laundry folding robot will probably have the same amount of world-changing impact on freeing people's times as the invention of the gas stove.  I hope we see an affordable one invented sooner rather than later...just a single robot arm that you can park on a solid surface, then throw all the laundry you have around it, then come back in 8 hours and have 10 neat stacks.</div>

Life Pro Tip.

**Plug the drain while you shower**

It makes the shower about twice as warm, because your feet stay warm rather than the veins on the back of your feet and the cooler fallen water and airflow working like an air conditioner.

Also, it works as a timer, so you know by how full the tub is, how long you've been in there.

If you don't have a tub-shower, then a wash cloth quartered and tossed onto the drain will all but stop the water from escaping.

However then you do have the same problem as taking a bath, mainly that you're surrounded by a pool of your own filth.

Speaking of baths...

Why do men take long showers? Because we're usually 50-70% bigger than women by mass, probably 10-15% bigger than women by height, and **WE DON'T FUCKING FIT IN A BATHTUB.** A bath for a woman is fun and warm and relaxing. A bath for a man in a normal bathtub is frustrating and cold and irritating. We need something the size of a Jacuzzi tub to enjoy the same kind of bath that women can.

Women, if you want to know what it's like for a man to take a bath, imagine shrinking the size of your bath by 15% in all 3 directions, and you'll see it feels like you're sitting in goddamn laundry basket.

Let’s not pretend like the Republicans have been tough guys either. They’ve let MAGA and Tea Party ass hats come in and hijack a party that was about supporting global democracy, freedoms, and security. There was lots of common ground between old school Dems and Republicans. 

I want to go back a place where we could all have constructive disagreements and not fucking bombastic name calling and being faux tough guys. It’s all bullshit theater and we need to call curtains.</div>

I wish there could be some concessions for the greater good.  But each social group insists on slamming every issue down or throats constantly.

There are so many people who would support people's right to live their life and don't care about your gender or sexual orientation they just don't want to hear about it every day. 

I feel so many of the LGBTQ community are so focused on being represented and heard that if you don't embrace every aspect of the far left they attack you like your some sort of biggot and it pushes people away.</div>

If they cared about CO2, they wouldn't cut down trees which absorb CO2, and they wouldn't fly in private jets which emit massive amounts of CO2.

That's because it's not really about CO2, it's about wealth redistribution and power.</div>

Except, like, those images were just still shots of people in the middle of any number of random gestures where the context immediately goes out the window if you watch the video to see what they were actually doing, and Elon - you know - did something that looks exactly like a Nazi salute on video not once, but twice (just so you know it's not an accident). 

This is just like that. Trying to find any shred of visual evidence that, if taken 100% at face value with zero context, fits their narrative. But looks like an utterly stupid comparison if you look at even 5% of the context.</div>

Making a skill out of telling yourself "I don't want to be doing this, I need to change something" and then finding an easy thing to do instead - get a glass of water, look out the window, go for a walk, run an errand you enjoy, make coffee, jounral, do some reading, call a friend/family member, etc. is the only thing I've been able to use as a tool to turn my day around and take control of my life one tiny action at a time. (And I also still struggle every day). Instead of wallowing in my unproductive thoughts, I interrupt them with a lesser action.</div>

I had Warcraft playing through my 5.1 surround system at movie watching volume and with just ANC on, they blocked out 90% of the movie. With ANC and music or white noise at 10%~20% volume, you cannot hear anything at all. It’s mind blowing. At the office I no longer get distracted by the endless chatter and noises.

                        <div class="comment-body">How much noise does the headphones block vs the earbuds? 

I have a couple of higher-end Sony ANC headphones, and I am not happy with how well they block sound. I still hear all my coworkers chatting happily away. My Jabra Active Elite earbuds are much more efficient at blocking noise, probably because they actually seal well in the ear, and are not just around the ear. 

I often use Loop Quiet ear plugs under my ANC headphones to block more noise, when I want quiet and not music or ambiant noise.</div>

Put your earplugs on and then your headphones over them to increase the noise cancellation and then have Endel/Brainwave.fm play ~~Biannual~~ Binaural beats and you will be blissfully unaware of the rest of the world.</div>

Secondly, even if the critic is right that the underlying science is wrong, if the chip performs then it doesn't matter why it performs. That is a job for the research labs to tease out but in the practical world all that matters is results. 

It is exactly like people saying that AI can't possibly replace humans and it is all just mimicry, to which the response is that it will then continue to mimic taking all of the jobs and revolutionizing society.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">there are way more then “one critic”

the critics are people who spent their life studying quantum effects.

They have had a successful history calling out microsoft and poking holes in their claims back from 2018.

An inside presentation to some scientists did mot dispel the smoke or settle the arguments, allegedly just raised new questions.

I think one cannot dismiss this news as a crackpot single critic who “ doesn’t believe in things they personally think are impossible “ 

yes if the chip “performs” its up to science to catch up however where is this evidence?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Tried it out on Google AI Studio and it kinda sucks as an image generator. It can't even consistently generate two different animals in the same image. If you ask it what it got wrong, it would understand what it is, but unable to fix it.

I think OpenAI is working on reasoning for image generation, i.e., a model that "imagines" and refines multiple versions before outputting the final version. That should work a lot better.</div>

Low poly image. I told it to write the prompt to make the change I wanted. It was obviously trained on indie games with a "low poly" look, they all look like this.

But wait, there's more! You can give it new styles via context! I gave it the photo I linked above, and a screenshot from the N64 Goldeneye game. I had it write a prompt that would transfer the style of Goldeneye onto the photo.

It's not as good but still somewhat did it and looks much more like a 90's video game instead of a modern indie game pretending it's using low poly graphics. The view down the street made it in, as did the blue signs and yellow car. I've found that it has trouble incorporating information from multiple images into one image. I gave it a picture of Todd Howard and a picture of Phil Spencer and when I told it to make an image with both of them in it, it generated two random guys that didn't look like them. It can do just one at a time, but not both.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I believe that it is not trained on Indie games and here is why:  
\- making a decent API even for a single game requires extra engineering effort  
\- it is hard to scale both from the perspective of containerization and coverage of the available games  
\- the number of indie games is limited  
As an DL researcher, I'd suggest that they used a lot of synthetic data like generating simple worlds and rendering multiple videos for these worlds.</div>

If you were **hiring** someone, would you just say, **“I need a copywriter”?**

Hell no. 

You’d be **specific** about the expertise, the industry, the years of experience—you’d find the \*\*best\*\* person for the job.   

 **Instead of this:**  

❌ “Act as a copywriter and write a car sales page.”
