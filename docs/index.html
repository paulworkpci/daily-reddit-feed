                        <div class="reply-body">Furthermore, early data points suggest that the upcoming ARC-AGI-2 benchmark will still pose a significant challenge to o3, potentially reducing its score to under 30% even at high compute (while a smart human would still be able to score over 95% with no training). This demonstrates the continued possibility of creating challenging, unsaturated benchmarks without having to rely on expert domain knowledge. You'll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible.</div>

While that has been the case in the past, the costs involved previously weren't eyewatering. Even massive cost reductions to this model on the scale that we have already seen will leave this massively out of reach for most.

This currently isn't the way to mass cheap intelligence. It's more OpenAI flexing how much resources they have to throw at something.</div>

People will only care when AGI has affected them in a way that positively affects their lives which I hundred percent know will happen. Before AGI or when AGI comes these will happen.

"I agree with you there are so many pointers to address and it is hard to address every pointer that society needs help and changes with. I hope there will be a more effective treatment for OCD, germaphobia, paranoia, schizoaffective disorder and every single other mental health disorder known to mankind by 2025. Anything better than ECT is what I am betting on and really hoping for along with things better than meds, TMS and all forms of other treatments. I mentioned this elsewhere so just repeating this here. I am just posting this here as all my ideas are in here and I wanted to convey my thoughts.

“I can’t wait for AGI to cure all mental health and physical health disorders hopefully by this upcoming year.  I don’t want to go to weekly ECT sessions tbh and I want a second chance in life to remove all negativities from my brain and mind. I wish we had advanced tech from extraterrestrial lifeforms to benefit us already. One can only hope for this and hope for a utopia soon:) 

Also I went through psychosis and I am doing alright, not where I envision myself to be. However I guess we have to wait like a year before another effective treatment comes out which sucks:( 

Waiting extremely sucks and going through ECT gave me a huge fever for so many hours after doing it. Multivitamins help a little bit however I just want their to be more effective treatments (which aren't painful) for people with mental health disorders.

I have OCD (germaphobia, and more), and another mental health disorder. When someone touches me or gives me a hug or walks by me I feel my brain acting up for example. It is annoying and hard to live with however I still tell people like me to be strong and remain hopeful that something will come out that will benefit their lives. What do you think?”</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">"Today OpenAI announced o3, its next-gen reasoning model. We've worked with OpenAI to test it on ARC-AGI, and we believe it represents a significant breakthrough in getting AI to adapt to novel tasks.

It scores 75.7% on the semi-private eval in low-compute mode (for $20 per task in compute ) and 87.5% in high-compute mode (thousands of $ per task). It's very expensive, but it's not just brute -- these capabilities are new territory and they demand serious scientific attention."</div>

Just as will hardware and compute cost continue to improve. This is why 2026 to 2028 is gonna be such a breakthrough, as a lot of chip fabs in construction will come online, which will depress costs of compute massively and increase amount of total compute available.

Each question is so far above the best mathematicians, even someone like Terrence Tao claimed that he can solve only *some* of them 'in principle'. o1-preview had previously solved 1% of the problems. So, to go from that to this? I'm usually very reserved when I proclaim something as huge as AGI, but this has SIGNIFICANTLY altered my timelines. If you would like to check out the benchmark/paper click [here](https://epoch.ai/frontiermath).

Time will only tell whether any of the competition has sufficient responses. In that case, today is the biggest step we have taken towards the singularity.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">I disagree. Yes, it's extremely difficult questions from niche sections of math, but that's still in the data. Not those questions but math in general. There is a structured order to Math problems that makes it for ML learning much easier to learn. ARC-AGI is random nonsense.  Questions which are intuitively easy for most even average intelligence people but extremely difficult for AI because it rarely if ever encounters similar stuff in data and if it does even slight reordering of things completely changes to how LLM sees it while for a human if square is in the middle or in the corner doesn't matter at all. The fact that LLMs is able to approach this completely new problem for it and able to consistently solve it is a very big deal.

Here are some predictions for 2025, ARC-AGI Co-founder said they are going to develop another benchmark. I think they will be able to create another benchmark where LLMs barely register but humans will perform at 80-90% level. I think in area of creative writing o3 is still going to be next to useless compared to a professional writer, but it is going to be dramatically better than o1, and it is going to show first signs of being able to write something that has multiple levels of meaning the way professional writers can.  And I think o3 is going to surprise people at level of sophistication it can engage with people.</div>

It’s been a while but since following this subreddit I’ve been so astounded by how much we have developed AI and to sit back and see people scoff at the progression we have made is mind blowing. Zoom out and see just how much has changed in so little time. It’s absolutely amazing. Everyone keeps saying that it’s not good enough and being negative towards something that literally didn’t exist two years ago and now we have models at Ph.D level intelligence and reasoning. I remember when I followed this subreddit everything that is happening now was just a distant dream in my mind and now, much sooner than I thought it would occur, AGI is starting to reveal itself and I’m in absolute awe that as a species we are capable of producing this intelligence that I hope we utilize to produce boundless benefit for humanity.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">I think the thing people don't understand is that aside from simple scaling and increasing the number of GPUs you have, the 'optimization' of AI models isn't like just coding them better.

Most of the advancement is scientific experimentation. We make some hypotheses that making models with X feature will improve them in some way, and then we try it out and see. It may or may not work, and then we try something else. We don't really know what will work.

So we do a bunch of experimentation and then take the bits that work and keep going with them.

So what AI will really need to improve itself is the ability to code and build hardware yes, but even more important for 'algorithm/architecture' is the ability to create new hypotheses about ways to build models, and new tests to test those new builds, and then to just do that hundreds and thousands of times automatically, as good or better than human AI researchers who spend all day coming up with these ideas and building them and testing them etc.</div>

&gt;"o3 surpasses previous performance records across the board. It beats its predecessor in coding tests (called SWE-Bench Verified) by 22.8 percent and outscores OpenAI’s Chief Scientist in competitive programming. The model nearly aced one of the hardest math competitions (called AIME 2024), missing one question, and achieved 87.7 percent on a benchmark for expert-level science problems (called GPQA Diamond). On the toughest math and reasoning challenges that usually stump AI, o3 solved 25.2 percent of problems (where no other model exceeds 2 percent)."

It's going to be ever better at full launch.

OpenAI is working on o4 at this point, while all of the other companies are racing to catch up with o1. The lead will continue for the forseeable future, unless OpenAI just simply runs out of money for compute, or if President Elon passes some law regulating the company.</div>

                <div class="post-content">By "people," I’m referring to those who argue things like:

* "O3’s compute costs are too high."
* "Models still can't solve basic questions (e.g., the infamous Rs test)."
* "ARC-AGI isn’t a true measure of AGI."
* "We’ve exhausted all data and will hit a wall soon.".....

You’re missing the bigger picture here. The **BIGGEST** takeaway from O3’s release is that AI progress isn’t slowing, it’s accelerating. O3 was launched just three months after O1! And cost per unit of intelligence is reducing...</div>

It's like computer CPUs and clock rate limit. Yes, we found a limit it's difficult to go over, but everybody who knows anything understands a *single core* of a modern i9 is at least two orders of magnitude faster at doing calculations (FLOPs) than a Pentium 4 from 20 years ago, even with the same clock rate.

I believe it's the same with AI models. Yes, we will find limits (like the amount of training data), but other avenues of research will keep improving the models.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">The data wall is also very temporary. Models until now have blindly consumed internet data en mass. Now effort will go into evaluating the value/quality of the data that is consumed. And with that ability you can start training on generated LLM data, because yeah maybe 95% the data will degenerate the model, but from randomness there will be some 5% that is really good, and if the models can learn on that it can self improve, in essence like AlphaZero in chess and AlphaGo in Go.

There are three ways this evaluation function will take place:

* Self evaluation, heuristics, and automated evaluation. Kind of like the discriminator in GANs. Where this works, it will be blazing fast.
* The market of ideas. Kind of like reddit upvotes. Meh, speed.
* Usefulness at completing tasks. If the data you consumed made you better at making money/gaining compute then that was good data. You outcompete other models. Slow.

If you can glean an evolutionary process in there, it is not by accident. In any case you'll not see any wall, maybe a less exponential growth rate compared to the era of "free" data, but there will still be data.</div>

For the average question to ChatGPT, it doesn’t really matter if you’d use 4o, o1 or o3 - the answers are generally adequate across the board. What looks like stagnation is just most people being unable to keep up with the types of problems AI is now starting to tackle. Like, whenever a new model comes out these days, I always think “oh boy, let’s see how smart this one is!” and then I find myself unable to come up with any clever riddle or test. We’re in some kind of uncanny valley of intelligence where the closer it gets to human intelligence, the less we’re impressed because now instead of appearing to us as a very smart robot, the AI feels like a below-average human.

I am absolutely convinced that AI will go way past human level intelligence within the decade and no doomerism can convince me otherwise. Hell, even if it doesn’t, every single industry has yet to catch up to implementing all of the possibilities that new AI architectures offer.</div>

I'm an AI engineer and automating even simple tasks is a pain in the ass as they have so many failure modes - the success still depends on the skill of the prompter to cover a large list of failure modes, rather than the intrinsic skill of the model.

On that note, I think o3 will differentiate from o1 with a focus on multimodality. We never got native multimodal 4o which makes me think one of these reasoning models will have native multimodal (maybe o3 mini to make it more affordable?)</div>

It would be nice if they would say, this model is really good at reasoning, this one is good at code, and this one is a dirty little... nevermind... it's good at role playing chat.

My preference would be if they came out and said "This is o3, it's like o1's dumber brother but he's a good worker"  Not as focused on reasoning but does CoT and follows instructions very well.</div>

This infographic shows the variety of UFO shapes and movements reported over the years, including famous cases like Roswell (1947) and the Lubbock Lights (1951). It also explains how natural phenomena and man-made objects, like planes and weather balloons, are often mistaken for UFOs.

It's a great visual guide for anyone interested in UFO history and helps spark discussion about what’s real versus what’s misidentified.

Submission statement: This was taken on 12/19/2024 in north Knoxville, TN. The time was 7:11 PM. Video is facing north (away from the local airport TYS). I asked about the sighting, and the light apparently disappeared shortly after this video was taken one by one. It seemed like something worth posting, but please feel free to poke holes.

Not moving hovering for sure.  I’m telling you the alignment was like perfect in lines. They were ALOT more red then the video. Also do Chinese patterns just disappear like evaporate is if they never were there to begin with? 

Like they had a specific formation to them too. They didn’t look like lateens at all very astral. They were almost star shaped and bigger than what the video depicts them</div>

In waiting 50 years the collective &gt;!religious association!&lt; with that particular imagery had minimized to an extent that they could be accepted.

The reality is that there are \~8 billion people being held hostage by the few dozen who actually control the world.  None of "us" are starting wars or overthrowing governments in the Middle East or Ukraine.  Those atrocities are being perpetrated by the few in control.

And so yes, under the circumstances where the "many" are held hostage by the "few" -- yes loving, benevolent beings might finally seek to intervene.

Is this video real, or just a fake and is it a completely different drone? I apologize if these questions have already been answered.

Submission Statement:
I saw this on a subreddit last night, can’t remember which. 

The user claimed that it was seen facing toward Terminal 1 at the Dulles Airport in DC. If anyone can find the post and provide the link I’d be very appreciative. I don’t know if this is 150 characters and I’m not willing to count so I’ll just keep typing, and typing, and typing, and typing. I hope you all are doing well and safe travels for the holidays!

Edit: hijacked this comment for visibility

I just want to thank the mods, the anonymous user that sent me the link to the original post and some very interesting NOTAM amendments for the DOD aircraft flying in and out of the Dulles International Airport made recently.

You made it possible for this intriguing sighting by u/katieskittenz to reach double the amount of eyes that had already seen it on r/UAP before it was removed for apparently breaking rules. 

I try to be as skeptical and logical with every sighting that seems to defy explanation at first glance, as we all should be. I also look into any logical suggestions for an explanation from other users that tried to teach instead of ridicule. 

None of us can tell someone else with a different view that they’re stupid for not understanding something that seems simple to ourselves, instead if we try to provide evidence as to why they’re wrong while doing it in a civil fashion, we have a much better chance of figuring this out together. We need to be KIND, nobody wants to learn when they’re made to feel like an idiot or an outcast.

In my personal opinion, I have a gut feeling this is what the actual drones are looking for, probably under the table contracted from the DOD to maintain plausible deniability until they have an idea of what’s going on. But at this point, I don’t think anybody really knows the complexities of this issue. 

Wishing everyone safe and happy holidays with all of the people you love, whether these things are here to help us or hurt us, the ability to love and receive love will always be ours, so make use of it!

TLDR: thank you all, teach instead of ridicule, show love to your fellow human beings (that’s the most heroic thing you can do in the face of fear and unkindness)</div>

Submission Statement:

Pentagon press secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder held a briefing yesterday where he jokingly claims the lights in the sky are Santa Clause. He is openly mocking and gaslighting everyone who has had real sightings with these drones and it’s clear the pentagon is not taking this seriously when speaking with the public. 

The drones are no threat, yet bipartisan bills with government overreach are attempting to be pushed through congress. Rand Paul blocked the bill because of privacy concerns and the hastiness of how that bill was being pushed, I think this is a W for Rand.

The drones are no threat, yet airspace is being closed off, airports are being shutdown, and threats to shoot the drones in the interest of national security have been made. 

I’m not even American and this is frustrating to watch. But I guess if you see Santa in the skies you know you can call the Pentagon and count on them… right?

Submission statement: This is one of the letters sent to Linda Howe in 1996 by a person claiming their grandfather was involved in the Roswell crash. It states that the contact with the aliens will happen around the year 2025. I thought it's interesting considering everything that's been going on. 

The letter in question is from May 25, 1996 and it says: 

"Most of the interatmosphere operations, occurred in the Western Hemisphere, and in the areas of Europe &amp; Asia, with populations consisting of "network selectees". This was a term that the Aliens used to identify persons destined for contact. These contacts were "conceived &amp; predestined prior to birth" and was "scheduled to be accelerated &amp; increased throughout the three decades prior to 2000 A.C.E., when the network would initiate the "transition".

**"Transition" was a term that meant full-contact, occurring around the Terran year 2025.**

All this information was acquired from the sole surviving Alien occupant, and was correlated with information retrieved from the databanks of the command console panels within the Disc command center."

Seems like the letter can be found here but it's behind a paywall: https://www.earthfiles.com/2018/08/05/part-3-mysterious-micron-layers-of-alternating-bismuth-and-magnesium-from-bottom-of-wedge-shaped-ufo-2/

But I found the full text here: http://www.gregssandbox.com/alien/roscrash.htm

I found the letter screenshot here: https://x.com/Docneuroeo/status/1869937094837317697?t=B_qfgyNSjp3ff268GAe8aA&amp;s=19

                        <div class="reply-body">Except it's complete horseshit? She gets called an antisemite for the crazy antisemitic conspiracy theories she engages in. Look at her youtube. Defense of Nazis in WWII, holocaust denial, blaming Jews for fucking everything. 

But because she is anti Israel as well she can pretend it's some conspiracy in which you can't criticize Israel and that's why she gets called an antisemite? 

And in what world is it taboo to criticize Israel? It's the political fad of the past year. It's like when I see people claim everywhere that any criticism of Israel isn't antisemitic. Except absolutely no one has ever said that. Yet people repeat it as if it were some rallying cry. 

Shows how low effort the bullshit in regards to this topic needs to be for hordes of people to agree with it.</div>
