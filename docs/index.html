They created labels and now it's Boomers vs Millennials vs Gen Z.


This started in the 60s with news pundits like Walter Cronkite cooking up stories about the "fight" between "the generations".


Then there was advertising with catchy songs singing  about "the Pepsi generation" and similar. 




There's  no such thing as isolated generations. It's a flow of people every year being born and expiring. Over and over.  There are no big gaps between generations delineating them.


The conflict is created online with stories of selfish evil Boomers and spoiled Millennials and dopey Gen Z. It's impossible for a entire group of people to be all the same no matter their  culture,  religion,  income, or geographic location. This is all cooked up propaganda to create suspicion and hatred.</div>

Developed with WIRobotics' proprietary mechanisms and control technologies, the newly unveiled ALLEX comprises a new high-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic hand that senses reaction forces like a human and yields compliantly to external loads; a highly backdrivable robot arm with more than 10 times lower friction and rotational inertia than conventional collaborative robot arms; and a upper body with a gravity compensation mechanism....</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;  with a 3d render. 

no, I thought so too but there are so many little things that are 'right' here that I doubt this is a 3D render. 

You can see the cables going to each finger jiggle when the thumb is being moved because there is slight friction with other cables, 

0.25 the section here and pay attention to the way all the cables slightly shift https://youtu.be/qT2UZ3oN4xI?t=56


and the big one that gave away this is most likely real is you can see the glow of green LEDs on circuit boards as it moves the arms around, and you can see down into the arm. That is a shot that is there for less than half a second. You don't put time and effort in to getting something like that looking right if it's going to be on screen for no time at all. 

Edit, focus on the lower internal part of the arm at this time:

https://youtu.be/qT2UZ3oN4xI?t=66

Could this be fully rendered with a lot of money and man hours going towards making it look real? sure. Do I think it is, no. There is a certain look to reality that's very hard to capture, little movement imperfections and this has them.

(I also thought the fingers were clipping at the start which is what lead me to go over this with a fine toothed comb)</div>

Look at houses that you know will by way out of your price range and one’s way below. It will only give you more information, context, and experience, which are all invaluable when making one of the largest purchases of your life.

It's harder for sellers and agents to spruce up step cracking in the walls, a yard that is soggy days after a rain, etc. Their focus is to get you in the door and see everything pretty and fall in love, then justify the damages as ok b/c you love the pretty parts.

He was like the perfect grumpy uncle.  He picked apart everything we looked at.  

When he said about our current house “Eh, I don’t see anything too exciting about this one” we knew we had a winner. 🙂</div>

I did this. But my mom is actually a realtor/broker. 

Also, also, if it’s in your budget check out new homes. We realized most homes have a “style” of layout and we could quickly figure out what we liked.</div>

- Cursor is great, it’s just like VS Code but i don’t have to remember stupid low-level manipulations.

- oh we need voiceovers, let me just try this ElevenLabs thing until we get our voice contract done as a placeholder.

- Hmm not sure what we should send our designer for this idea, let me brainstorm with ChatGPT image gen.

- We need a new cutscene here! Why don’t we try with Sora before spending $1M on our animation studio?

In none of these scenarios does AI make it into the final product, yet it’s becoming embedded in developers workflows, which in turn is eroding their mistrust of it. It’s only a matter of time before everyone uses AI in every task, to the degree that the AI can help them…</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I would actually guess it's the reverse.  AAA studios are very driven by corporate culture, cost savings, profit margins, so they are going to be trying to heavily explore these new tools.  They also have the budgets to do large R&amp;D projects and create new work pipelines.

Indie studios on the other hand aren't usually in it for profit as their main driver.  They are passionate about making games.  And from what I've seen online these seem like the types of developers who would be very passionately anti-AI. They have the most potential to gain from AI if it can truly 10x their output, but because the process of making games is such a big driver for them, many will refuse on principal.</div>

Thinking of the institution of valet driver, one of the fun service jobs to have in college, disappearing, and taking with it part of the fun of going out. People feel special when others take care of them with deference (I work in fine dining).  
  
One of the reasons that vending machines never destroyed the catered food industry is that it’s isolating.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think its still a lot cheaper to send a tow truck out than to send this thing over a highway, through a city, to reach a car by itself. And if you send it with a tow driver, you might as well just let the driver do the tow instead.

Also, I don't think this device is rated for going 60km/hr on a highway, it's only good on flat surfaces, and probably at pedestrian speeds, and probably only for a short period of time.</div>

He and the tech bros need the populace to stay docile and not demand for antitrust/regulations to slow down AI; so Sam throws these BS rainbow farts about ultra rich elite suddenly caring enough about the poors that they would share their wealth.

Sam and the bros need the populace to stay docile until the tech bros get too much momentum in their AI development to the point that they are unstoppable.

Once they consolidate enough power and influence, they basically become untouchable. But they are not quite there yet, so they need to smile and be humble to avoid unnecessary public blowback</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Giving people AI compute is stupid, the vast, vast majority of people are just going to take the most direct path towards turning that compute into money. That means selling your compute to someone who can use it or, when AI becomes capable enough, just turning the compute loose and telling the AI to fetch as high a price as possible.

That's *still* going to end up with the vast majority of compute as part of a monolith because it's just the most efficient way to manage things. Large companies are far more efficient than small businesses, and they have to deal with office politics and greed. AI will be able to scale far better than humans, to the point where any individual trying to do anything on their own with compute will be akin to trying to brew your own Coca Cola.

Ultimately that just circles back to the "default post-singularity" world. One in which there's a single monolithic AI that handles most decisions and everyone has access to some part of the resources it generates.</div>

It’s not designed to be fast on straights but they have one of the best (if not best) handling aspects of new cars under 150k (msrp to msrp) without major mods. And yes this includes G8x M cars and base 911 and 718.

There’s a reason why GR86 has their own cup car series.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There is a REALLY promising solution that seemed to have popped up out of nowhere. Let me explain:

People have been attributing all sorts of things towards the issue with aging, from telomeres to mitochondrial strength. But it seems like those are probably symptoms rather than causes

A paper came out proposing that actually, it's degredation of DNA over time. Basically, imagine a fresh newborn set of DNA on a line making a wave. But this wave has a bunch of sharp complicated peaks and valleys. This is because our genetics are fresh and designed "perfectly" for survival. Well over time as cells divide, mutations occur knocking down those peaks and valleys. Making them less sharp and drastic, and more smooth. 

All those ragged peaks are actually our optimizations for life that get us through reproduction. But they are very fragile and don't last long through cell reproduction... So eventually your epigenetic profile has less fragile complexities and slowly just smooths out towards the mean. As it smooths out, we loose all these advantageous traits and slowly "age" over time. 

Sinclair proposed that if we restore those fragile complex peaks and valleys of our epigenetics, we could reverse aging. Lucky for us, our cells keep a record of our original optimal state, but just doesn't use it. However, recently they found a drug and procedure that can get the cells to divide, but instead of using the latest code, it uses that original blueprint for the next cell divide. 

On animal studies, at a local level (I believe the optic nerve), they used a drug that does just that, and the results were... It worked. The optic nerve returned to it's youthful state and vision was restored. 

So the theory not only has evidence of working, but a pathway for delivery. 

Just recently, they've moved to human trials.

Will be interesting to see if her book about the sweaty nonce comes out now she's dead.

There is no issue mocking his sweaty nonceness though.

It might be sleep apnea which is potentially life threatening. Or at minimum they may give options for ways to minimize the snoring. I wanted my wife to be able to sleep so I went to get checked. No sleep apnea, but I did have extremely oversized turbinates and a large bone spur obstructing airflow in my nasal passages.

                        <div class="comment-body">This is why I have no concerns about the future of programming and developers alike.

I've noticed two things have happened over the past 20+ years in programming/coding and continues to happen:

1. Software development has become easier than ever
2. Software development has become more complex than ever

Humans have this tendency to take improvements that simplify things, and use that as an impetus to create more complex things, sort of undoing some of the efficiencies that were gained by new tech in the first place.

Like, the idea of being able to write full applications within a single language is an incredible achievement (e.g. React), and being able to virtualize hosting environments has streamlined deployments...and has also led to 5 page brochure static sites compiled in Astro and composed of multiple JS libraries, virtualized in Docker containers and hosted in "serverless" flex compute AWS EC2 instances....like, what?? So complicated for something that used to be quite simple (but, granted, there's more capabilities, as well).

This post is a great example of it happening again, now with GenAI tooling. It's not simplifying much of anything, it's increasing our capabilities to do every increasingly more complex endeavors. And that is already leading to so much more complexity across the whole workflow and stack.

If software was largely a static process with the same goals and end results required throughout the decades, then I would absolutely agree that these tools would spell the end of the industry, like the lamplighters that were extinguished by the light bulb. But software is constantly evolving and I am already starting to see that these tools are enabling more complexity to take shape, where software itself is going to increase in capabilities in terms of the problems it can solve. This means we'll be pushing these systems to their limits, and likely needing more technically oriented and skilled individuals to work with these systems that keep growing in complexity, not less. And to those that say these systems will just do all the new work that's required: that's just conjecture and we don't have any evidence thus far that is likely the case.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think it depends on what kind of environment you have. I can see environments with a lot of legacy tech laying around that was built up over 15+ years can be hard to adapt. But I've also seen cloud native companies built from the ground up with a very simple tech stack where adoption is easier. For example, the place I work at, we've built our entire platform w/ microservices on kubernetes, and they are all built using kotlin w/ springboot and using postgres as a db. All the services pretty much look the same but the business logic is different. This has made it much less challenging for us to adopt AI since we don't really have disparate environments to deal with.</div>

What I’ve come to realize is that most of the shaking was past patterns and trauma dissolving. As one of my teachers said many times: “if you are in a posture of openness (like meditation or yoga, anything other than bliss or freedom is what’s leaving you. Let it go. It’s not unlike a bowel movement. Sometimes pleasurable, not significant in itself. Not worth examining or persevering over! Let it pass…</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The vibrations are commonly discussed in r/astralprojection, see also [elements of OBE](https://www.microserenity.com/consciousobe.html).

It does not necessarily mean you must be about to leave your physical body, but it is one of the common signs that conditions are right or that projection is approaching.

It has nothing to do with "impermanence". It is right to probe the experience, to understand it and not fear when it occurs in meditation.</div>

Like, imagine for a second that the Republicans didn't oppose Ukraine or whatever it is you want to call their antagonism towards Ukraine and their friendliness towards Russia. Imagine if US sentiment was unified towards Russia like it has been for basically the last 70 years.

If that were the case, do you think Russia would be doing this specific thing? I don't, because it wouldn't make any sense. The only reason they're doing this is because, in a certain way, it *does* make sense.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">First off, for the naysayers in the comments, this is real. [Analysts knew this was coming almost two years ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTiZVuX5WRs) Of note in that video is the slide shown starting at 23:35. Even without CATL's incredible pricing of $10/kWh, they were predicting that sodium ion batteries would take the lion's share of the battery market. At $10/kWh, they will absolutely dominate and CATL will have problems keeping up with demand. For that reason, I doubt CATL is fudging the numbers here; they could ask substantially more than that and *still* have more customers than they could reasonably handle.   
  
Second, this is the first salvo for this battery technology and frankly not the thing people should be talking about. It will make EVs more affordable than ever, absolutely. But you need to think bigger. The problem with renewable energy is that it isn't dispatchable. It's windy when it's windy and if you don't need electricity at that particular time, too bad for you. There hasn't been a great way to store it up until now. This is revolutionary for renewable energy and rewrites the economics of that industry. This is the *true* beginning of the green revolution not because it enables EVs, but because it enables renewable energy to a degree not possible until this year. Fossil fuels are dead and so is nuclear.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yep, cheap grid scale batteries was the missing piece that allows renewables to become practical fossil fuel replacements. 

Now you only need enough wind or sun energy during peak generation to cover the next 24 hours. It completely changes the equation. 

But more than that, I want to see people putting these batteries on their own homes. Tying solar panels to in home batteries makes them super useful as well, while utilities were sick of people feeding power into the grid.</div>

Oh well I guess I can't be too mad about nuclear dying because something much more practical took over. Still kind of a win. And if we manage to make SMRs practical then nuclear can become competitive.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Indeed, that's a lifetime battery, easily. And this is only the second generation. 

This tech arrives just in time to power androids / humanoid robots. And power the second tsunami of EVs. Battery replacement was the major factor holding them back. With a cycle time like that, you're gonna get 30 years of use without replacement, makes them a viable ICE replacement. And the extra weight won't matter for anything except high performance race cars, which can just use lithium and nickel metal hydride, etc. 

What an amazing breakthrough.</div>
