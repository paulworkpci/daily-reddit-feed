                <div class="post-content">I’m trying to figure out what to do. 

I used to have the Claude Max $200/mo plan for Opus 4.1 in Claude Code.  

But lately I’ve been getting excellent performance on GPT5 codex via codex CLI. Better than Opus 4.1 in some ways. 

I have tried Codex via the plus plan, the $20/mo one. So I’ve hit weekly limits. 

But Sonnet 4.5 has just been released albeit I haven’t really given it a spin. 

Any advice? My use case is NextJS dev. </div>

Try out gpt-5-codex high (better instructions following), gpt-5 high (better logic), and sonnet 4.5 (better design sense) for your usecase. Try Opus 4.1 via API.

                        <div class="comment-body">i‘ve been testing sonnet 4.5, gpt5-codex and glm 4.6 plans over the past few days with a nextjs project.  
i think sonnet 4.5 is easily the best of the bunch. glm 4.6 is the worst, it needs a really good plan by a sota model or well broken down tasks, otherwise it codes itself in a corner.  
gpt5 codex is great, sometimes best but i hit the limits much quicker than sonnet 4.5, even after the anthropic rate limit changes a few days ago. that’s on the 20$ plan. i also like claude code much more and the surrounding ecosystem of tools.  
  
if you‘re still unsure, my advice would be to test all of them for a month with your use case.  
but generally sonnet 4.5 with claude code is hard to beat and there you at least have the 100$ option to upgrade to when you hit the 20$ limit.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I find in general that GLM 4.6 is an excellent reasoning model but a poor coding model. The differentiation here being it's just not good at writing code and doing agentic tests. It is when given all the information going to come up with the eventual correct answer, and that's by no means a small feat for an open-source model. 


Claude Sonnet is, as it's always been, the best worker. Its code isn't necessarily the strongest generated code, but it is the strongest worker, extremely task persistent. Codex, and people are conflating here the tool and the model. Codex the tool has addressed the "working" part of the agentic coding frontier, for itself, but isn't  necessarily a stronger model than Sonnet. 

Someone's going to respond here with that whole Codex works for 24 hours or whatever. And yes, I mean that's the tool, not the model.</div>

Initially i was told NO meals, coffee or cocktails before meditation under the Ziva meditation program and understandably followed that advice although so far i did attempt meditating after having a cocktail one night and i quickly found out why. It was just lousy. But i am curious about what people think about food and coffee.. or any other legal mind altering substances?</div>

The fact that an AI is already getting 30% tells me it's far from out of reach. The level of improvement from that to radiologist-level is small in comparison to getting to 30% to begin with.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Totally agree. If ChatGPT 5 can already get 30% now it will most likely take less than 2 Years to get a near perfect score or at least over 90%. People have to stop thinking AI improves linear. If that were the case image generation would still be hardly recognizable as an image. AI (at least for the moment)  is exponential in computer power + better algorithm.

Scoring an almost perfect score in a test will not be the same as replacing every radiologist the next day but it will be a stepping stone.</div>

You absolutely don't need to do that. That's basically the bitter lesson once again. These generalist model will saturate this by next generation. I think this is an adversarial benchmark like humanity's last exam. They cherry picked questions that fool the current LLMs. When the next gen models come out starting with Gemini 3.0 pro we will see how long it lasts.</div>

Brain read/write interface mkultra shit that they've weaponized to run psychological harassment campaigns on with AI doing most of the heavy lifting.  Targets are usually isolated loners, easily discreditable, prone to blackmail, transgenders with "certain" fetishes, etc.  I can imagine the Manchurian candidate variety of this weaponized mental illness program is the enhanced version of the "gangstalking" or "electronic harassment" version that's being run of thousands of citizens.

This is why during the congressional testimony surrounding Havana Syndrome they couldn't answer a single question unless it was in a classified setting.  The congressional testimony itself was to get out in front of the diplomats and make sure tinnitus was the headline and not what really happened to those people.  They were then awarded 2-500k each in a lawsuit payout that was basically hush money.  This is also why when Congressman Higgins questioned Crooks father and was told his son out of nowhere began hearing voices and talking to something late into the night that wasn't there that they had to memory hole the entire incident.  The train stabbing is also related to this technology, as is Kirk.  Someone needs to investigate the guy who distracted police and was slapped with cp charges in the same way Paddocks brother was.  I think they do this when a little too many details about their little Manchurian candidates magical mental illness "voices" are about to go public.</div>

When I got there, she told me she had received so many messages (in the one hour the post was up) trying to negotiate the price down, including trading a pool cue stick. She sold it to me since I didn't bother with that little game of trying to squeeze out a better deal from an already more than fair deal.</div>

Given that the biggest companies and countries in the world have gone full pot committed to creating asi, and are in a race to do so, I can’t see how it won’t come soon . The idea that it will take like 10+ years seems so unlikely to me . You’re betting against the full force of capitalism</div>

                <div class="post-content">A few months ago, I found myself needing a commuter vehicle. I spent about 3 months looking into all kinds of options and ended up narrowing the choices down to 3-5 year old EVs as they fit my budget (25-30k) and needs best. I took some notes during my test drives and wanted to share my impressions. Keep in mind these prices were from a several months back, so they might have changed by now: 

**2022 Bolt EUV Premier**: 200hp/265tq, 250 miles of range and around 20k used.

Would you ever consider PHEVs, or was range anxiety not really a thing?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thanks! For my use case, range anxiety was not an issue. Most EVs can get 150 miles even in winter, and my commute is 65 miles round trip. I am not usually going longer than that distance at one time anyways, and for those rare occasions, we've got the Pacifica to fall back on. 

The conveniences of an EV makes it hard to think about going back. It makes so much sense for a daily IF you can easily charge at home. In a few years, you'll likely have a lot more options to consider so you'll have your homework cut out for you!</div>

EV mode is great, quiet, smooth, comfortable, has  heat pump, so for short winter drives, i dont need the engine at all. I've gone 3000km on a tank, only need a level 1 charger.</div>

E-tron Definitely didn't make use of its space as well as the Ioniq, especially given how much bigger it is. The E-tron was a more insulated experience by maybe 15% but did have higher quality materials inside, so it will be up to the person making the purchase if that's worth the risk of ownership outside warranty.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Interesting. I came to the exact opposite conclusion between the Ioniq 5 and Polestar 2 like 3 years ago when I drove them back to back. I found the ioniq to be significantly more fun than the polestar. I also felt like the polestar was a bit too claustrophobic, while the Ioniq felt open and airy. Anyway, to each their own and hope you enjoy your new EV. It's great to have choices!</div>

Obviously this is a challenging problem, but so was the protein folding problem. The issue with 'solving' disease is that it takes a lot of data, both measuring and processing (connecting that one protein being over or under-expressed may be 3 or 4 steps upstream of a disease). This is what AI may be perfect to solve. 

People are bad at predicting exponentials, especially when there is a 'moment' where the technology, all of a sudden, becomes incredibly useful. 

The famous NYTimes article is a great example of this:  
  
"**Flying Machines Which Do Not Fly**" is an [editorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editorial) published in the [*New York Times*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times) on October 9, 1903. The article incorrectly predicted it would take one to ten million years for humanity to develop an operating [flying machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane). It was written in response to [Samuel Langley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Langley)'s failed airplane experiment two days prior. Sixty-nine days after the article's publication, American brothers [Orville and Wilbur Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers) successfully achieved the first [heavier-than-air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavier-than-air) flight on December 17, 1903. - From Wikipedia</div>

And part of this is just because of how complex disease really is, I am sure I am preaching to the choir here if you worked in pharmaceutical chemistry, but like -- a lot of diseases we barely even know what's going on, so how can we "solve" them?

Take something like fibromyalgia. There is absolutely not a consensus agreement on what causes it. *Why* are these people hurting all the time? I mean we can point to central sensitization but -- *why* did that happen to begin with?

And we can try to turn down that central sensitization with drugs like doluxetine or pregabalin, but in RCTs they are only modestly improving pain signals, and they have lots of off-target effects.

I am honestly not entirely convinced that, for many diseases that have somatic symptoms i.e. pain, fatigue, sensory sensitivities, etc, that the "cure" will actually be a pill. I am wondering if it's more likely to be something like.... Extremely precisely directed transcranial ultrasound pulses. Maybe severing circuits that should not be firing. Maybe up regulating  the descending inhibition circuits. I don't know. I'm not a neurologist or a chemist and I'm out of my depth here. But a pill cure seems like a false promise, does it not? How would you even go about trying to design a pill that cures fibromyalgia? Or chronic fatigue syndrome?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My understanding is that while the design of a new drug is a big part of its creation and often the most difficult and we can absolutely automate big chunks of it, I don't know how automatable are efficacy and safety trials which famously (or rather infamously) may take decades in total  (all the while people are dying in line waiting for it).

It's often said on the futurists side , "oh well we'd simulate the human body", but for anyone having worked to health sciences , they'd be the first to recognize how absurd this is. There is not **a** human body. There are tendencies, but the diversity out there is absurd. Biology routinely does weird things when designing bodies that you have to wonder how come they all belong to the same species sharing the same basic DNA, yet the outward results ends up looking similar regardless (while some of the internal mechanisms may even have the reverse effect from each other because biology cares about outwords results, somehow, unlike a true engineer, it is fast and loose with process and does whatever, far from the cookie cutter designs we have on computers say ).

My point is that as hated and as drenched in ... conspiracy they may be, the clinical trials' times are there for a reason. We are testing drugs which can literally be poison to some members of the same species, and often  **are ** even successful drugs...

Ideally drugs design would have been personalized. But good luck with that, and yeas, that would cut down clinical trials significantly. But I don't know if our automation in drug design can be so efficient, that a person comes with an ailment and within a day we have a novel drug ready for him and his particular organism. That would be something, but that sounds even more absurd than cutting on current clinical trials' time significantly...

In other words I think the  bottleneck is elsewhere and not drug design, I think. And while we'd get a better medicine, I don't think we'd see significant differences from "time to the market" perspective...

I.e. even if drug design becomes significantly faster (hasn't yet) many peole alive today won't benefit because it would often take a decade or more to have it to the market...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I design novel therapies for a living as well.

Consider the complexity and cost of the average therapy today, as you probably are familiar with, \~$1B from idea to approval (recent estimates as high as \~$2.6B, but I'll estimate conservatively for simplicity).  
  
The pharma industry lives or dies on therapeutic assets, not pure platforms. Platform technologies can accelerate discovery and become repeatable asset-generating engines, but the rate-limiting factor is still committing \~$1B per program. This was true for payloads like mRNA, delivery systems like LNPs or AAVs, and it's also true for AlphaFold, ColabFold, etc.  
  
These platforms help repeatedly at a particular stage of development (eg, structural refinement and discovery) but they don't significantly reduce the subsequent capital commitment required to drive programs to approval.

My general feeling is that computation, like other platform technologies, will continue to add value. That value is even more generalizable than most platforms because it can apply generically to any of the existing platforms to even further accelerate their development.  
  
I just don't see how you all of a sudden massively reduce the cost per asset because validation in the physical world (preclinical or clinical) is always required.  
  
Instead, what I think it will do is increase the probability of success per asset over time (which right now is only \~10% or less), which would still be an enormous help. Similar to how targets with human genetic validation appear to 2x the probability of success per asset.

I hope overall costs per program come down too, but that seems like a structural issue bounded by the physical world rather than computation.</div>

What exactly you ask for matters a lot here, don't just say `review the diff`, say something like `use maximum reasoning effort in your role as senior software analyst to audit all changes for actionable defects and API contract violations of any kind and report all that you discover`. `API contract violations` is practically a magical incantation when it comes to using AI to audit code because the concept of what exactly adhering to the contract of an API entails goes much deeper than just the individual function calls that might show up in the diff. It changes your request from validation that you called a few functions correctly to validation that you called the functions correctly AND correctly prepared whatever you passed to them as input AND did what you were supposed to with whatever they returned back to you as a result. I have also yet to see a chain-of-thought model completely fabricate/hallucinate an issue and have it still think it's an issue by the time it determines whether there's an API contract violation there and if it causes an actionable defect or not. It's a great way to find annoying bugs that stem from rare invalid combinations of flags, return values or subsequently triggered events you aren't handling, etc.</div>

Wrap your dishes in your clean clothes. Wrapping them in newspaper just gets them dirty and you have to rewash them. Bonus your packing 2 things at once.

                                <div class="reply-body">Here you go: 

- Wrap your dishes in your clean clothes. Wrapping them in newspaper just gets them dirty and you have to rewash them. (Bonus, you’re packing 2 things at once.)

- For more delicate clothes buy heavy duty garbage bags with the pull out ties. Leave the clothes hanging, pull the bag up to the hangers and tie the strings tightly around the hangers to keep them bundled.

- Buy some washi tape. Then when disconnecting your electronics put the tape on the machine and the plug-in. 

- Use different tape for different machines. Leave it on after the move too, it’s handy to know which plug is for what. Especially USB chargers.

- For every room have a dedicated box for stuff you’re not sure that you want anymore or you can’t remember using in awhile. After the move if you haven’t touched it in 6 months, time to clear it out. Use the tape on the outside of boxes to indicate for which room it belongs in (ie Pink Tape is Kitchen).

- At the new house place a hanger with the tape on it on the corresponding door or cupboard pull.

- Don’t try to cook the day of the move or the night before. Give yourself a break there.

- Largest items go in the moving truck first. Then pack smaller stuff around it or on top. For instance the dining room table nightstands underneath (blanketed to buffer). Boxes on top to the ceiling. Move back to front furniture then pack to the ceiling on top. Take the drawers out of the dresser while you are moving it. TVs go in separate loads or another vehicle wrapped in comforters.

- When hanging clothes back up put them the wrong way on the rack. When you wear it turn the hanger around. After 6 months evaluate whether to keep or donate.</div>

They recently added some things to it which actually makes it more usable, but it's too late for me.

I don't see how they expect us to use their software if it just breaks after a bit and can't control the volume while casting. They need to fix these things</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Ken Copeland owns Victory Channel which owns the FlashPoint show.

Times Radio just did a mini documentary on FlashPoint's role in Trumpism:

[Inside the religious MAGA sect that believes Trump was anointed by God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJvtfB80vYU). 

It's like 30 mins and shows the cultish power of mixing politics with people's faith. Also interviews some defectors.

FlashPoint combines politics, Christianity, and conspiracies, and they directly contributed to inciting Jan 6. They said Trump shouldn't concede and framed it as a spiritual war against evil.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A comment from that sub: "The shift from the left the last 40 years has been pretty wild. They used to fight for the right of nazi rallies to exist in America because of freedom, now they think it's understandable if someone with conservative values gets murdered in front of their family."

What the actual fuck are they even talking about? When the fuck did the left defend Nazi rallies? And, ah, yes, CK was offed because he simply had "conservative values!" JFC. I love how these goons get automatically offended whenever fascism or Nazism is mentioned in a negative light. Telling on yourselves much?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;  I don't think I ever noticed one.

While I agree that blatant hallucinations have been reduced, you not noticing a hallucination doesn't mean you haven't experienced them. The most insidious types of hallucinations will be the ones with the most verisimilitude.

For anything really important I ask at least two labs' models; it's unlikely they'll hallucinate in the same direction so if they agree you can at least be fairly sure it's legit.</div>
