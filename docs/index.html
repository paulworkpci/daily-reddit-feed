                                <div class="reply-body">Im actually looking forward to (quality) AI generated MMOs, where content, story, dungeons are created and evolve organically. 

Kind of like Guild Wars 2 living story and living world, except continually evolving at scale. It will end up like those MMOs where someone can find a piece of loot no one has ever seen before.

Datamining and the internet means its impossible to get surprised in an MMO anymore unless you live under a rock, and you can never find anything no one else has found after the first 6 minutes of a patch going up. The animes where people are inside MMOs and find cool stuff like Shangri la frontier make me jealous, and procedurally/AI generated content is the only way we'll get there. 

Will be a while before it's done well and its good though.

Then slap VR on top and we have heaven. Even if its just Quest/PCVR (current) style.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Just wait until there are games based on your personal city/hometown.

Using things like Google street view, satellite images, pictures of the inside of homes from real estate listings, and photos from business reviews/Facebook - AI will be able to make pretty accurate reconstructions of every place on Earth.

Imagine playing Fallout, but you're walking through a post-nuclear war version of your neighborhood, pubs, parks, schools, church, malls, office, etc. The missions and stories will be based on Wikipedia and news articles about local historic and current events and the war of [current year + 5].

You could do the same with car racing games in your local town. It'd be accurate down to your own personal car in the real world, accurate police cars, real-time construction sites, etc.

I think pretty soon we'll see apps made so you can map your house and photograph things like inside of drawers, pets, and art so the game matches things perfectly. Combine that with your smart fridge, Ring cameras, the ultrasound in your Amazon Echo devices, local weather and the game world will always match the real one.</div>

This looks to have memory in a 3D space. Far superior for playability.</div>

In this post, I am sharing my meditation experience.

I started a 40-day meditation challenge, thinking I would find peace, maybe even a little enlightenment. Instead, I got a front-row seat to just how wild my mind really is....

That is a real win to understand you can do that. Key to getting to a place where you see things as they are.</div>

If I reflect, considering Meditation as a challenge, a task was not the right way of starting. We should not bring our ego or consider doing meditation with the expectation that we are doing some higher purpose stuff and we will become higher-level souls, more liberated than the rest.</div>

* The files never really existed, just a hoax by the Dems
* I barely knew Epstein and any evidence that we hung out was falsified by the Dems
* Epstein and I stopped hanging out after he stole some of my employees 
* Epstein and I stopped hanging out over a bad business deal</div>

If there is a lack of information/testimony, etc from people involved, it's because it's been covered up before. I'm much more interested in who directed these people the last 20 years to keep covering this shit up, I promise you alex ascosta didn't just think to do this shit himself.</div>

These specs are insane. OpenAI basically just open sourced o4-mini.

The only reason they would do something like this is if GPT5 is so damn good that it blows the open source model out of the water and renders it so obsolete that they don't care if everyone has access to it for free.

                                <div class="reply-body">You’re fooling yourself if you think there are any humans out there that know more than any of these LLMs. You might find a number of different humans that are smarter on particular topic than current LLMs but you’re not going to find a one single human that knows all those things. Back to what Altman said here “smarter than anyone you know” were well beyond that.

Edit- leaving the follow up here so I don’t have to respond to each reply from people making up some bullshit about what they think “smart” means.  “smart” is the ability to understand, and solve problems quickly, having both a deep understanding of specific subjects and a broad knowledge across many different subjects.</div>

Special thanks to @GoogleDeepMind for inviting me to try out Genie 3. I'm excited to share my thoughts on this early research prototype and also some of my live recordings below:

I spent the whole day playing with the system and when it works, it is truly mind blowing🤯.

Yeah, isn't this the bigger takeaway than anything to do with video games? I assume integrating this into something like existing multi modal models is years away still, but giving the models an ability to reason not just with language but with something like this which becomes almost akin to an imagination or visualization seems like one of the big missing pieces right now</div>

Found a discord server for my hobby, joined it, stayed relatively active on it and now I have a weekly hangout with my friend group at minimum and am awesome community of people with similar interests. It's not always that easy to make friends but I think it's way easier than childhood or college where it was no guarantees i had something in common with someone I met.</div>

Is this relevant? 99% of the population aren't hiring for a full stack dev. They only see the output.

You can't tell the difference between shitty 'conventional' software and shitty vibe coded software in *most* cases, but again, is that relevant?</div>

&gt;The New Yorker article "Documenting Trump's Abuse of Women" (24 October 2016) recounts Trump biographer Harry Hurt III's claim that Ivana Trump said in a sworn deposition she had been raped by Donald Trump:

                        <div class="comment-body">I don't think people really understand the context he grew up in as a boomer of his age. 

His lawyer during this accusations made the statement that at that time there was no crime for marital rape.

This was mostly true.  Until around 1993 a husband was not required to obtain consent to have sex with his wife. This was not a crime.  

As a guy born in 1946, his most formative years were during the time women had and minorities had no rights.

For a wealthy white guy with money and no conscience he probably thought it was pretty awesome.   

He spent his 20s and 30s watching minorities and women gain rights AND wages. 

He is nostalgic for the time you didn't need to be wealthy as long as you could keep other groups really poor.  

He, and many like him, think treating people fair, is to take away something from him, or treat him unfairly.  

His "grab'em by the pussy" comment though horrendous, represented the truth he came of age in.  You didn't need consent from a women.  Most sadly, the women and wives of his era knew there was no recourse.  If a wife in 1980 went to the police and said "my husband had sex with me against my will" they would not take a report. 

He erroneously believes it was because "he was celebrity".  The reality was most women knew it was always their word against his.  

Even today, within many circles it is still "obey your head of household".  

What is wild, at 50, when most men mature out of their sex pest phase, this guy was running a beauty pageant for teenage girls and employing teenage girls for massages at his golf course.

He was never the cool ladies man he portrays himself as.  Just guy with money  and a knack for spotting vulnerable people.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Excellent comment.

It's still this way to a degree. To this day, I honestly believe if a woman called the police and said, "My husband had sex with me against my will," it wouldn't lead to much of anything in a lot of places, unless you said he involved a gun or something like that.

To this day, a lot of people choose to believe the man over the woman and believe the woman is lying to get money or to hurt the man. Read what people think about, say, Conor McGregor's most recent case where he was found civilly liable of sexual assault in Ireland. 

There are a lot of reasons why women don't often speak out against wealthy men, and a big one is because they won't be believed anyway and now THEIR name will be drug through the mud.

It's absolutely applicable to Donald Trump.</div>

This may be the understatement of the year. The average casual track enthusiast is almost certainly going to be faster in a CTR than in any RWD or AWD car because the platform isn't just "ok, for a FWD"; it's actually just one of the best enthusiast cars that's come out in the last decade.

Seriously, while I'm sure Verstappen is at the skill level where he might be limited by the platform, assuming he can see the track with his head so far up his own ass. But an average driver? Hah. You're not getting anywhere near the limits where platform dynamics like which wheels are driven start to matter.

Plus, you know, limits are fun. Limits are what create challenge, and without challenge you turn into a rich douche who should give fewer interviews and spend that freed-up time trying to extricate his head from his anus.</div>

To the point where its neatly organised into blocks, consisiting of client side code, external services code and settings/APIs. The AI is then the interface between actual code implemented in your app and the nice cosy block diagram you edit. This would be a much better way to plan features visually and holisitically, being able to just edit each new block.

Yes definitely. this is just from the issues I personally have experienced, there is definitely more ways to plan that have their own benefits. If you have any suggestions let me know.</div>
