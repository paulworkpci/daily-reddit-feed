                                <div class="reply-body">This gets a little more tinfoil-hat, but there are a few weird historical facts about Elon that start to add up when you look at Elon's patterns of behavior over the decades.

Elon's namesake is the appointed fascist leader of mars in a sci-fi novel written by a german nazi in the late 40s(Wernher von Braun)

Elon's grandfather(from that era) moved to SA in the first place after being basically ousted from Canada after the fall of the Nazis for being the leader of a Canadian techno-fascist party that supported Nazi Germany.

But combine that with his pattern of behavior, with Thiel's open political history and you do indeed get a very scary duo of supervillains</div>

The real culprit here is not timing but the technological path. LLMs are, although incredibly technically impressive, also kind of "brute forcing" a way to intelligence. That makes it prohibitive for anybody to really lead the race (Deepseek never lead) without billions in funding. So now they have to balance their personal ethics against investor desires and the potential harms of letting a more authoritarian state like China win the race if they *don't* give investors a good enough deal.

If the AI breakthrough of the last 5 years had been more compute and data efficient, we still would see capital dominate the race but less so.</div>

Kash, your lane is attacking enemies of Donald Trump.  You know it, I know it, we all know it.  If it hasn't been explicitly ordered already, come Monday morning you're going to have direct orders to go after Elon and to deny any connection between Trump and Epstein.</div>

Yet apparently Joe here thinks Elon is just randomly making stuff up despite all the Trump-Esptein photos, Epstein on record saying he's Trump's best friend, and Elon giving himself access to tons of government documents.

Dumping the raw investigation file would violate the privacy rights of every rich asshole that ever flew out for one of Epstein's dinners.

There's probably not more pedophiles. Just the ordinary, long-standing laws and DOJ rules that rightly constrain the US government from dumping citizens' info just because they spent time with a criminal.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I drove one of these on an autocross course at an event hosted by Ford a little while ago. I thought it was maybe a little over-ambitious to set up an autocross for a trucklette on all-seaons but it handled itself really, really well. Even got it to hang the back end out - and by that I mean a tidy little power slide, not a shitty ass-drag. It's a lot of fun, I think it'll do well. 

The engineers on hand implied they kind of set the truck up as a canvas to be built on. They know 99% are going to be commuters so there wasn't much point in doing it themselves (and it would drive the price even higher). but it's not hard for you to get a lot more out of it. For example, the front two-piston calipers are off a Euro Focus ST, but it still uses stock Maverick pads. The tires are an obvious weakness too, BUT, anyone who's actually serious about play time is gonna do pads and tires at a minimum on pretty much any vehicle anyway. EcoBoost tunes aren't exactly hard to come by, either.

It was also tongue-and-cheek implied that there's more coming... possibly in the form of dealer installed accessories or something.

Either way I think it's pretty kickass.</div>

(I have three family members who were ready in 2021 to drop money and buy one.  One could not be had anywhere without insane dealer markups for wait times over a year and a half.  Only one followed through. The other two bought different used cars.)

A Maverick at today's 30 grand?  Meh

At 40 grand?  They're out of their freaking minds

First, I've been meditating for 20 mins/day for about 3 months now. Super simple. Just sit and focus on my breath. When something comes up, I temporarily make it the new object of meditation, mindfully and wordlessly note its characteristics, and then bring myself back to my breath. When I'm on my breath I try to increase the resolution of the breath as much as possible and avoid sinking whe...</div>

You will outgrow that phase and get high on not getting high.

I think that I'll still need weed to get high, though. Mindfulness doesn't feel like being high, so the only way to get that experience is to consume weed. If anything, mindfulness just enhances the high, kind of like being cross faded, but more... all-encompassing.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’ve had so many of the same experiences - being able to ‘shift’ my consciousness into the present and let go of my usual perspective felt so incredible while high. It also felt ‘easy’ - there’s something about weed that seems to relax our perspective and make (at least some) meditation states more accessible. I also think those experiences are a bit empty - very pleasant and enjoyable while they are happening, but in retrospect I don’t see them as having deepened or enhanced my practice. 

I’m really happy for you that meditation has freed you to make thoughtful choices about when/whether you get high. The space to really make choices rather than simply react - it’s such a gift. </div>

i have the same feel with the emptiness, it’s definitely not the same.

I even experienced a thing called Nimitta. Which is when you are so immersed in the breath, the breath becomes light and then I switch from gross feeling of the breath to the light which I was inhaling and exhaling. And then many things happened. But this is long time ago…</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That sounds dope. I had a pretty wild experience not too long ago where I got really deep in a sit, and I saw what I can only describe as psychedelic imagery. Pretty wild, and it was really hard to not get sucked in but to keep coming back to the breath.

I typically try to avoid sitting meditation while high, though. I feel like sitting meditation is a special time where I can gift myself a moment of truly doing nothing, of true stillness, and being intoxicated is inherently full of motion. It becomes a distraction for me that I constantly have to wade through to navigate the waters of my mind. Not a gift anymore, but more like homework.

Meditation *outside* of sitting meditation is perfect for weed. Outside of sitting, everything is in constant motion, so adding one more thing makes the roller coaster of life that much more exciting.</div>

ANYTHING Trump does is good.  That’s the baseline.  Anything undocumented immigrants do is especially bad.  If an undocumented immigrant commits murder, it’s 100x worse than a citizen committing murder.  Anything Biden did is insane and we are lucky to still be alive after his administration.

If Trump actually did something bad (“grab em by the pussy”), then the Democrats did something worse, and that’s the only thing she’ll talk about.

I’m liberal but I can list off a dozen things Biden did that I didn’t like.  I can admit he was wrong sometimes.  She won’t ever entertain that idea with Trump.  It’s baffling.

Now yes, she’s 75, panics when she has to critically think or learn a new task or technology, and watches Fox 24/7.  But what the fuck…Joe is like 55?  How is he so far gone already?</div>

And contrary to what some are saying, the privilege survives your death. As it should, for the very reason you said - it's a strong privilege, so that people are comfortable telling their lawyer anything. </div>

For larger apps, this can be helpful for a roadmap only. AI is an "assistant" not a PM, DevOps, backend software engineer, front end software, testing, cybersec, etc.

Can AI speed up your workflow? Yes
Can AI  code a simple app? Yes
Can AI can help non tech people to code an app? Yes

Can you type an enormous, over complicated, over detailed, time consuming, "optimized' prompt and test it, test again, and try again until it "works".????

You can hop on a plane and cross an ocean in a few hours You can pull a little slab of glass out of your pocket and instantly see and talk to somone on the other side of the planet 500 years ago you would’ve been buned at the stakes , You can walk into a supermarket and buy almost any food imaginable, fresh strawberries in the middle of winter, spices from all over the globe. You have access to medicine that can cure diseases that would have been a death sentence for a medieval king. You have heating and air conditioning for basic comfert.</div>

I think that when ChatGPT broke into the mainstream, Reddit started promoting this sub to people who joined the ChatGPT/OpenAI subs. We then had a huge influx of people who:

1. Have little to no understanding of what the concept of the singularity is

2. Have little to no interest in learning what it is 

They just see a post pop up with the funny British AI man and rush to the comments to make sure everyone sees how clever they are for 'knowing' that everything every public spokesperson says is clearly 100% hype, and scripted to pump share prices.</div>

I thought I’d share bc I’ve seen other posts sharing their GPT’s responses.

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree. And also many similarities with Stoicism, which is not unsurprising since both traditions seek inner freedom in a chaotic world. Advaita Vedanta teaches that liberation comes from realizing the true self, beyond ego and illusion while Stoicism is about aligning with nature and reason, to attain tranquility. Both focus on detachment from external outcomes, mastery over emotion, and a disciplined ethical life as the path to peace. They are culturally different of course but they do converge on the insight that freedom is found not by changing the world, but by understanding and transforming the self. That is definitely a path that the world needs now!</div>

Lujic: What would you have done? None of you can understand because none of you were there. You don’t think about what’s right and wrong when you’re just trying to survive. Right and wrong, those are just words… they don’t mean anything! When you look around at you and all you can see is death! And all you can feel is the hunger. What would you have done?

Prosecutor: We’re not talking about a plane crash in the Andes here, sir. You never got off the runway. We are talking about a delay! You are the sole survivor of a 35 minute delay!

Lujic: 35 minutes I will never forget!

Prosecutor: You ate 112 of your fellow passengers. You could have eaten just one, but no, you ate a little bit of each passenger… WHY?!?

Lujic: Your honour, I am not an experienced cannibal! I did not get on that plane expecting to eat ANYONE! I simply tasted a little of each in hopes that the next one would taste better! I’m sure your honour has done the same thing with a box of chocolates.</div>

Google and OpenAI long ago gutted their safety teams, and the OpenAI for-profit pivot is just absurdly bad-faith, given their [founding charter](https://web.archive.org/web/20230714043611/https://openai.com/charter). In comparison, Anthropic is at least a public benefit corporation — obviously not ideal, but better than nothing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">They are simply the best lab out there. I work for another large AI company and when I got an offer from Anthropic, even though the total compensation was lower there was no doubt of my wanting to join them.

It didn't work out as I needed to relocate and it would be too harsh on my children. But they are the golden place to work at.

They have the best talent outside of RL speciality (DeepMind is better there). They understand LLMs the absolute best with an *insane* lead in mechinterp. Their safety team takes things very seriously and they lead on this front as well.

They are also setting industry wide standards with MCP and some upcoming safety standards and open sourced tools for navigating your models' internal working.

They are also furthest along with agentic workflows and could outcompete others on the product front if they manage to become industry standard.

People outside of the industry don't know this but Anthropic is considered the most talented LLM specialized lab, which isn't that crazy when you realize they split off from OpenAI and were the ones that designed GPT-2, GPT-3 and designed what would eventually become  GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. These are still the 4 most impressive models OpenAI has ever made, and ever since the talent has left OpenAI didn't have a lot to show for.

No one at this level actually cares about money, mostly about impact and how much you can influence where the world would be in the future. Remember, almost all of us think our own jobs will be replaced by AI in 2-5 years time and we'll have ASI controlling our destiny before this decade is over. Money isn't really of importance here. And Anthropic is the *only* lab that is both honest about this timeline *and* takes safety and "maximum good for humanity" seriously.</div>

On the other hand, "Anthropic also leads the AI industry in holding on to talent, with an 80% retention rate for employees hired **over the last two years.** DeepMind follows closely behind with 78%", OpenAI at 67%

So my guess is that in the last two years DeepMind got significantly better in retaining employees.

                                <div class="reply-body">You haven’t read it? I’ll share a summary in case other people like you don’t go beyond the clickbait title.

**Scenario 1**:
- Simple task -&gt; found that non-reasoning models outperform reasoning models.
- We’ve heard this before, in certain cases, simpler machine learning algorithms outperform complex deep learning algorithms.

**Scenario 2**:
- Moderately difficult task -&gt; reasoning models outperform non-reasoning models.
- It makes sense again.

**Scenario 3**:
- Very difficult complex task -&gt; both fail
- Oh no, who’ve thought that LLM can’t still solve everything?

This has nothing to do with the Nokia analogy and all to do with believing clickbait titles.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I don't think they are making that claim. 

They created tests to demonstrate the fact that LLMs outperform LRMs (thinking models) for simpler tasks. And that they are equally bad at very difficult tasks. Along with a few other interesting details.

I think most everyone agrees with that. Going by everyday experience. Sometimes the thinking models just take longer but aren't much better.</div>

I have heard of people getting to 500+ with double overhand, but I think that requires large hands and pretty intense grip strength.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hey folks,

I wanted to share my **unpleasant experience with Gemini 2.5 Pro billing**, in case it saves someone some money and frustration.

# 💡 TL;DR:

If you try Gemini 2.5 Pro through Google Cloud, the moment your **free trial credits run out**, **Google starts charging you immediately** — without any warning, prompt, or consent. Even if your billing alert threshold is set to 0 USD.

I got charged **–140 EUR overnight** for what I thought would still be a free trial.

I found that Gemini via OpenRouter is the best way, prepay my usage $50 at a time. I can switch to Claude when Gemini gets stuck, and vice versa, and see my usage in real time. There are no billing surprises ever.</div>

I've gotten used to my warning signs but even with years of experience I play it safe because falling can lead to a concussion, broken bones, broken teeth, and even death. It's better to sit down than to fall down. Don't play that game, just sit down.

But yeah, if you don't have that experience, just sit down. You could easily hit your head passing out and die.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Agreed but it can be hard to recognize. I’ve fainted twice.

One was uninteresting: a blood draw when I was sitting already and I knew fainting is a risk so I had a few seconds to alert the tech before I went out. 

The other was unexpected and began with weird feelings I couldn’t identify. The context was standing in a small concert at my college. I hadn’t slept well and hadn’t eaten, so I wasn’t in a good state. But I had what felt like a minute or so of warning before fainted, except I didn’t know it. Several problematic feelings came over me but couldn’t put my finger on them exactly. I thought I felt hungry. Then I thought I desperately needed water. Then I felt fatigued. Then maybe I need to pee. It’s like my primitive brain was cycling through all the possible problems trying to figure out what was wrong. Like someone caring for a crying newborn trying to figure out why. 

I guess my point is if you feel like this, you’re probably fainting. Time to sit down.</div>

You’re not smarter than Mark Chen. You’re not more talented at something than Mark Chen. Even if you train all your life, if Mark Chen trained as well they’d most likely beat you. And Mr. Chen is facing the reality that AI systems are better than him. They’re better than you.

Jayyyysus, we get it, you idolize Mark Chen. Sorry, I don't want to check out your newest Mark Chen fanfic.

Mark Chen isn't better at everything than everyone else in the world. He also has good reasons to hype AI stuff since he's high up in an AI company. CodeForces also is not a general test of programming skill, it's competitive programming. Narrow problems and solutions that are not much like the messy, ambiguous real world.

&gt; They’re better than you.

At competitive programming, not necessarily real world programming.

It'll be easy to see the point where AI _actually_ becomes better than human at real-world stuff. There are a massive amount of open source projects on GitHub, where are the accepted AI pull requests? Where are the real projects being run by AI?

If AI is better than me, it should be able to do those things. There will be evidence out in the open. That evidence doesn't exist at the moment.</div>
