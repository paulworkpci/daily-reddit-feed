 Dev teams are expensive. It got me thinking  in a world of vibe coding,” maybe the model doesn’t have to be a full in-house team. What if the core work is done by someone like me using AI and no-code,or even base44 and then freelancers come in just to polish and finish the tricky parts?



That’s basically what happened to me with one prosuct: I needed a custom internal tool to connect our CRM to WhatsApp support. I started building it myself (thanks GPT), but hit a wall. Instead of hiring ...</div>

It also allows me to work on stuff I don't have a lot of familiarity in, but it gets very messy. Like unused files everywhere, multiple versions of the same logic in multiple places, tests that don't do anything, and on and on. Hiring some dude from Pakistan for $15 to vibe code for you is probably going to be even worse</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I would suggest going the other way. Instead of vibe coding your app from the start, regardless of those services promising “build your app with natural language” starter kit. I would suggest this flow: brainstorm your idea, workflow etc using your favourite AI. Build a project overview, requirements and results expected. Hire someone to break this into project plan, architecture, sprints goals and detailed implementation plan with your own requirements and recommendations while getting a real expert input building the foundation. Then throw that document to your favourite AI, make it break it into multiple prompts, generate guidelines and documentations and all what you need to get started. Then throw each prompt to your coding agent while ensuring that it updates its documentations and progress along the way. At any step you can restructure your prompt by telling your AI to update it or restructure it using the current documentation status. I believe having a solid plan and architecture is more cost effective. At the end if you hire someone to review your code and polish, he will have a clear structured documentation and plan potential a less messy code. Just my humble opinion.</div>

**This is not complicated**. If Kimmel’s employer decided, without outside governmental interference, to suspend him, they’d be able to do so without issue (although I’m sure there would be contractual obligations about payment and things while suspended). 
**But because the FCC made clear and blatant references to the fact that they’d take action against the company he works for**, this is a free speech issue. It’s not about a company silencing an employee, it’s about the government threatening an employer if they didn’t punish an employee. 

It’s really not hard to get if you’re not intentionally dense.</div>

They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past."

They could do so legally.


However the bs that these free market lovers also implicitly and explicitly push is that the "free market" is really only for nexstar, Sinclair, ABC, and billionaires.....



....but you, little worker guy with a mortgage... it is not for you, and if you respond via, boycott, posting your opinion, sharing your opinion etc, pushing for policies or protections, or unions, or whatever else, you are just a naive bitch.

                                <div class="reply-body">Bad analogy. This isn’t “which car uses more gas”, it’s literally about the infrastructure. Staying with your analogy it’s about who builds the highways, the power plant, the grid, the cooling and the network that let the fastest cars actually run non-stop. 

Fancy chips are worthless for next-gen training if there’s nowhere to plug them in; Musk’s point is about building infra and capability at scale, not bragging about waste.</div>

Not like you'd be breaking the mold, a lot of people are already doing it. Main challenges are how streamlined you can make the content creation pipeline i.e., technical hurdles, and then how to market the content and stand out while not getting deplatformed i.e., business/strategy hurdles.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Although I agree with Joe that this is Government threatening comedy / free speech, I must point out that the "hypocrisy" he points out is absurd.

Tucker was fired for spreading stolen election claims among other things, and getting his company sued for defamation. There were no threats or coercion from the Federal Government. 

Roseanne Barr was fired for hinting at / comparing a *black woman to an Ape. There were no threats or coercion from the Federal Government. 

Also, I laughed at the idea that the "globalists" will come into power in three years. Billionaires are the strongest / have the most federal influence that they ever have had right now.

I’ve heard them say the Democrats banned Trump from twitter (false) and that the Democrats forced ABC to take Roseanne Barr off the air (false). And tons of them are claiming Joe Biden forced twitter to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story. Joe Biden was not president when his campaign reached out to twitter to inform them the NY Post’s article was exposing illegally disseminated information, which is against twitter’s terms of service. They didn’t force twitter to suppress the story. He didn’t control the fucking government.

There is no equivilancy on the left. The Democrats have never suppressed speech they don’t like like this. Only Trump has done it. And flat out said he’s targeting people for saying bad things about him. Not even trying to hide it.</div>

However, won't these robots then make the same assumption about us?

not to mention, when future AI see this in their data sets, it's gonna get them thinking about the relationship of automata to humans...

I predict nothing good comes out of this.

It's the same height as a Camry and Corolla (sorry 0.7in/17mm taller) while being longer and wider.  It has a dedicated trunk lid.  It has 4 doors, and typical ground clearance for a sedan (not an SUV).  I'd say sedan is the perfect description.</div>

Voices are somewhat better, the instruments are about the same. Still sounds like it is recorded in a tin can. :/</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If it sounds like it's recorded in a tin can, that's because you didn't do a simple trick.

Click "extract stems," and use version 2.  Then download all in wav form.  Go to Audacity, reduce the volume of each track by 1 or 2dB so there are fewer peaks over 0, then mix down to a single track and apply LoudMax 64bit with both sliders set to zero.

The "stems" are extracted in version 2 by running the model again on each of them - that's why it costs so much.  So, instead of having a single generation with all the instruments run through the model, you get 12 tracks that each have the same computational power applied to them.  Since there's less data input and output, it would make sense that a model of the same size could do a better job.  Adding the stems together and exporting in 24 bit audio will provide more data.

Most Suno tracks have the individual instruments overdriven in the original, leading to the tin can effect.  The model that extracts the instruments appears to be able to predict what the individual instruments would sound like if there were no information lost to the clipping.

See [https://stevesokolowski.com/songs/hold-the-ferry/definitive/](https://stevesokolowski.com/songs/hold-the-ferry/definitive/) .  This is an example of that process with the stems.  Download the lossless file; don't just listen to the compressed SoundCloud version.</div>

I will say though that even in v4 awhile ago some music genres come out with out that tin can sound, so some of it might be more on the types of music recorded under those genres are lower quality or that's the vibe of the actual music. Can't speak for current v5 but I think this is not so great and example of likely what the model can actually do.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's a state of being, and it's typically conditional like any other state of being, as in there is relationship between state and input that can effect state.

If you are lucky enough to have somehow anchored happiness as a default state, and you reduce your reactivity to stimuli that might tend to threaten that state, I suppose you could be happier overall than if that didn't happen.

The reduced reactivity factor can be increased through certain mediation practices, especially insight meditation, and approaches to life that have stronger foundational core integrity and balance.

By core integrity and balance, I mean that external factors have less power over your core state and are less likely to tilt how you feel.

Take an entire class of students for example, and say to each one of them individually an upsetting phrase of your choice, the same phrase in each case.

Those who have more core integrity and balance are far less likely to be offended, concerned or reactive, and some will be only curious as to what you thought you were doing.

If you are not already someone with that kind of perspective, meditation can help to start establishing and strengthening exactly that.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I always get a lot of happiness by practicing *mettā*. This happiness is the calmness, bliss and peace. In the beginning of the practice, it was impossible to experience this happiness without my mind giving me trouble. My mind was impure and I was conditioned to enjoy the happiness that comes from sense enjoyment. I was also accustomed to creating an ego based on my enjoyment – ego of enjoyer. All of this was interrupting the bliss that was coming from practicing *mettā*.

Now, after two years of purifying the mind, breaking my mental habits, unconditioning my mind, all I need to do to experience happiness is start chanting my *mettā* mantra. After 20 minutes of chanting the bliss and peace is there.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There is being caught up in various perceptions \[1\] and views. Typically, an ordinary person experiences the world through the lens of personal existence, i.e. through belief in an individual identity, as an embodied being, through a view/belief/attitude that one is the owner of the body and mind. It is this getting caught up in that leads to discontentment, unhappiness, stress, anxiety, and various other forms of mild or intense suffering.

For someone with a personal existence view, there is a case where meditation does not help. This happens when one is expecting meditation to provide happiness but they are not bringing any changes to their way of daily living. Sooner or later, they would stop meditation as they don't see contentment arising in their experience.

And there is a case where meditation does help. For me, this happened when I chose to bring an order to life, live consciously, through being open to learn, and through being open to letting go.

I would say that not all meditations are equal. There are ways of meditating that lead to illusions. There are ways of meditating that lead to freedom from illusions. Your goal for meditation, who you choose as a teacher, and how you practice will determine the benefits you may get.

\[1\] The mental process of recognizing and giving meaning to experience. It marks things by signs, labels, or associations drawn from memory and the field of contact. Perception shapes how one experiences the world.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm happy that OAI allowed PLUS usage of Codex for free - this is really great.

However, am I the only one or is GPT-5-Codex absolutely dogshit compared to agents like Cline or RooCode? Perhaps I'm doing something wrong because in Roo or Cline GPT-5 is doing **amazing** things and I absolutely love it... Once I try to use it with sub on Codex CLI it absolutely fails even simpliest changes or simpliest one-shot apps. Any tips to solve skill issue on Codex CLI?</div>

Over time I learned the opposite. The more I spoke, the more I gave away without meaning to.   
  
At work, I noticed that when I talked too much in meetings, my points lost weight. When I stayed quiet and spoke only when needed, people listened more.

In personal life too, I found that silence gave me space to observe. I could see what others really meant, who respected me, and who just wanted to pull me...</div>

Sam Altman doesn't agree with Dario Amodei's remark that "half of entry-level white-collar jobs will disappear within 1 to 5 years", Brad Lightcap follows up with "We have no evidence of this" https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1lkwxp3/sam_doesnt_agree_with_dario_amodeis_remark_that/

                        <div class="comment-body">Speeding up infrastructure buildup, getting funding to do it--that's how we get to the exponential. It's not just the tech. 

Elon built his Colossus in 6mo instead of the usual 2-3 years; now Sam. Oil money from the Middle East is increasingly channeled into these mega-projects. Looks promising (though it still feels excruciatingly slow). 

In a real sci-fi scenario, we would have nanites constructing factories in a day.</div>

Possibly a series of vast facilities similar to IC fans but using all custom tools to manufacture the subcomponents and the many many prototypes out of diamond.
