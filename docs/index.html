Even if you trust the AI, if a bridge crumble you better have the proper paper trail that you were not the one responsbile ... because at the end of the day, the user of the AI is the person responsible. 

That said if you are a little less optimistic about AI and AGI than investor. Then you are right, you don't need an AI emulating a human accountant, you have to rethink accountancy so it can be done mostly by an AI.

Should this top 250 comedy assassian who's DNA is full of violence, celebrated BJJ black belt with MULTIPLE WORLD TITLE WINS, dangerous hunting enthusiast who silently kills animals with bow and arrows, MAN up and take the lead by enlisting himself, lead the battle charge and Defend America by brutally and heroically attacking Iranian civilians, causing a regime change thus instilling the safety of America, Americans and pod cast listeners?

I don’t use rangefinders anymore — I ask the spirits. They speak through shifts in wind pressure and goosebumps. And when they whisper *“draw,”* I don’t think. I *release.*

This isn’t about violence. It’s about alignment. Precision. Discipline. The bow doesn’t kill — it reveals.</div>

There are many people who spend their time consuming, discussing ideas about the world than before I would argue. Is it some misinformation in that? Yes but before majority believed in religion so.</div>

Studies showed the idea of just teaching how to research an answer vs teaching basic skills + knowledge is flawed and doesn’t work as expected… what I rather see now teaching software engineering classes at a local university is, that many students can’t properly use a normal pc, have no clue to frame a problem and ask the right questions and even basic skills around writing are at bad levels for folks having A-levels. I am more worried it will just lead to a generation without the skills to really leverage those tools. Many can’t even setup an IDE as they often only grew up with apps and devices that make it too comfortable to use. People forget too much comfort will lead to losing vital skills</div>

What use is school when labor is free and energy needs are taken care of. You say humans should be educated. But in that world if somebody doesn't want to be educated, then we should let them. Human society will be extremely different. I don't believe we will live in a normal relationship world.</div>

I would go even further and say that data driven education is part of the problem. You need to recruit capable people and give them autonomy to teach well and adapt flexibly to the skills and circumstances of their students. Bureaucratizing education and forcing teachers to follow the same "empirically proven" methods will lead to mediocre outcomes at best.</div>

This developer's son is likely gifted, and thus predisposed to asking these sorts of complex questions.  ChatGPT didn't "unlock" this for him, he's merely expressing the same tendency that he would have channeled into some other creative outlet had he not had ChatGPT available to him.

"Normal" kids are not like this.  I was one of those weird gifted kids who always had hypotheticals for the teacher to address and the other kids were always annoyed because answering my question meant an extra 5 minutes past the bell.  Zero curiosity.  I don't see that changing: I just see people using another tool to be even more intellectually lazy.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s like how probably 80% of the population never learned how to Google effectively. 

They sit there saying “How do I (x)?” or “I don’t know how to do (y).” when they have the world’s knowledge base at their fingertips. They could find the answer by typing a few words and hitting search. 

We failed to teach people to Google properly so I’m not sure we’ll teach them how to use AI effectively either. 

I guess AI will become proactive in the future—it will be offering stuff up instead of waiting to be summoned. That will probably help a bit. 

But a lot of people (most) are just inherently uncurious. I don’t get them.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The fact that you can finally create a voice assistant with literally *any* voice including ones you clone yourself, is nothing short of amazing (not saying it’s perfect, it just came out after all).

I had already cloned voices of some of my favorite characters to use in their ElevenReader audiobook app, which is really great imo, but it’s even cooler to speak with these voices. 

The only downside is that it’s not exactly real-time although it is decently quick. I’m just waiting for the day we can use this with a model as intelligent as o3 or Gemini 2.5 Pro, maybe next year. Also I’m hoping that we will be able to use this with their new Eleven v3 voice model which would be really insane since the v2 model they use for this is already quite good.</div>

Arguably better than GM, who refuses to recall anything, and when they do, have absolutely garbage remediations for their “recalls”. 

I say this as a current GM and ford owner. The ford being an Explorer ST which the recall for the rear sub frame breaking was to apply the parking brakes when it’s shifted to park.</div>

My local Ford dealer left nuts off of metal shards that keep the side air bags in place. 

In the event of a crash, that could have killed me or my passengers. 

I very much see an issue because they have zero quality control in their service departments and continually look to pay the bare minimum on recalls and warranty work.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Right, because they aren't stochastic parrots. It's just so dumb. I don't know how you can have a long conversation with one of the latest models and conclude that it isn't understanding things at a conceptual level (aka thinking). They do not just operate on the level of language. They also operate at the level of concepts. 

One of the things people don't seem to get is that predicting the next word (token) in a paragraph well requires that you understand the meaning of what it being said. If it was just statistical guesses, it's prediction hit rate would be vastly lower than it is. The models discover general patterns that group things together at a conceptual level. That is what "understanding" something is. It's a kind of compression. 

AIs don't have feelings. They don't have persistence. They probably don't have subjective experience but they do have understanding/intelligence. People can understand things without being conscious too, as seen in sleep walking or blindsight. Part of their brain is understanding things and even reacting to them but it remains outside of their conscious experience. I suspect this is what's kind of going on with models. Sentience without consciousness. (Of course, it is possible that they are conscious. We have no way of ever being sure of that, one way or the other. My bet is that they aren't conscious.)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is because, and I agree with Hinton here, language is the most important modality.

I think language alone is enough for future superintelligence. Even though my French friend says, "Sacré bleu! Are you retardéd?" and insists you need symbolic rules, vision, baguettes, and whatever else.

But I’ll give you a solid case for why the obsession with vision is a human fallacy, and why vision is actually one of the least important modalities.

NVIDIA just released their new image and video model: https://blog.comfy.org/p/cosmos-predict2-now-supported-in

It’s designed as a simulation engine for physical processes. For example, if you generate a matchbox car driving into a Jenga tower with WAN2.1, the Jenga tower ends up either rock solid or made of rubber. Meanwhile, in Cosmos, it correctly collapses like you'd expect a Jenga tower to fall. That’s **evidence part one**: WAN was trained on billions of videos and still can’t generalize basic physics, while a text model can explain exactly what would happen, step by step (to a certain degree, don't smartass me).

To fix this, you have to train the video model almost exclusively on physical processes, and just hope the user only needs those, or use the Yepa thingy from Yann. Cosmos might correctly break porcelain under a mechanical press, but it has no clue what happens if you put a human inside it. We tried it (and I will fix this by training a beautiful body horror lora for wan)

**Evidence part two:**

On my Discord, I tried to provide some evidence to the folks there by generating a bunch of NSFW videos with video generation models that aren’t even trained on NSFW data (like NVIDIA’s new Cosmos2). Language is so stupidly overpowered compared to vision that you can just make things up.

Yes, the girl is an android in maintenance mode. That’s why she needs to open her mouth very wide. Don’t mind that flesh-colored pipe, it’s the cleansing tool the android gets cleaned with from within. And don’t forget to suspend a little white, milky cleansing gel from the tip of the rod for extra realism.

As you can see, you just paste in the screenplay of some mediocre hentai and you’ve basically jailbroken every video model.
And that’s the point, text communicates ideas, including the unrealistic, while vision mostly communicates what is. One can create; the other only measures. Active vs. reactive. Yadda yadda.

If something understands text, it understands literally everything. If something just sees, it doesn’t know shit.

Flies have eyes and are stupid as fuck, while the only animal on this planet with language rules the world. You have to be literally retarded to think vision is an important modality.
Most people just think it is because "uwu look how pretty the world is" and get all emotional.
Yes, but if I open any random page of the Narnia books, I’m traveling to an even more beautiful world.... just by the power of text.

And if we're going to define reasoning such that AI's are categorically incapable of it (e.g. "reasoning is something only humans do with their meat brains") then I question how good-faith these detractors really are. 

Imagine disagreeing with someone online about this and asking them, "prove you are reasoning". How could someone convince you, without a shadow or a doubt, that they're human? The harder you imagine that to be, the more ridiculous it is to suggest that LLM's are not doing it.</div>

I'm a professional programmer. C#, Typescript, and Javascript, are no problem, but I've used them all extensively for decades (without AI).

If you want to learn the language, you're going to have to force yourself to code in it for a while, without AI. Otherwise you won't learn it. It's like trying to learn a foreign language without immersion. You won't get fluent without immersion.

Going forward, I'm not sure how important knowing the details of coding is going to be. Understanding application design and patterns and algorithms is really where people will need to focus, and that's a good thing. That's where all the interesting stuff is happening anyway... Typing just gets in the way and slows you down.</div>

That said, over reliance isn’t great honestly if you want to create anything scalable.

More important that you can ask for the right things/questions and look over what it’s generated and spot the one or two subtle mistakes then know syntax by heart.

It has nothing to do with skill, and everything to do with that the human mind isn't super adept at retaining reams of technical specs, but are much better suited to remembering *the concepts that underlie them*.

It's OK to need to use a tool to look up technical specifics, whether it's a book, Google or an LLM. The thing that makes you a good or bad developer is knowing *what* to search for.

With that said, you can practice this skill and keep it honed, if it's important to you:

1. Keep autocomplete/suggestions disabled by default and toggle them with a hotkey
2. Rarely use AI unless its a last resort when **problem solving**. I still use all the traditional methods and always exhaust my own knowledge and methods before I decide to use AI to help me move past it. Turns out, I just really like to think about things.
3. I often will hand-type/manually copy over the solution, piece by piece, rather than just "apply". This builds muscle memory, makes me think critically about each piece of the solution that was suggested, and avoids potential conflicts. It also is super educational, as it often teaches me different ways of approaching issues. I often will change it as I bring it over, as well, to ensure a flush fit of the suggestions into my existing code.</div>

I work at one of the largest and most reputable tech companies in our country, and every year we run an internship program that brings in around 50–60 interns across various fields. Historically, we’ve had no trouble hiring seniors, but junior programmers and interns have become a real headache lately.

Here’s how it used to work:

1. We’d receive 2,000–5,000 applications per internship opening.


2. Candidates took an exam, which narrowed the pool to 100–200 people.


3. We’d int...</div>

You could probably do this via video call, if they do have an AI listening you can probably tell if they are reading answers from it’s responses.</div>

though its not surprising it got fazed out. it requires a person to grade it. the OP's company complaint is too many resumes for a person to read through. i doubt they would review pseudocode.

though LLM might be able to grade it - i think there would be way too many hallucinations right now.</div>

Well, guess what - no one is born being amazing at stuff.  Sure there is some difference in genetic ability but most of the reason people are good at something is due to them doing it.

But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”

                                <div class="reply-body">That's a very solid quote, and IMO the prime example is Stephen King. I do not think he is a once-in-a-generation talent. That might sound unreasonable at first, but hear me out. 

He's not like one of those rare geniuses that only wrote a few things and they defined a genre. He's no Mary Shelley or H.P. Lovecraft. 

He's a decently-capable person who sunk *enormous* amounts of time and effort into his writing. He's one of the most prolific living authors and has written a lot of classic horror. More than that, his books have been adapted into several classic films. I can't think of any other author in any genre who's had that level of success.

And it's all because he grinds away at it like it's his job, he works and works and works and produces stuff ranging from awful to incredible, honing his craft all the while. He's a master of horror storytelling because he worked at it and built it brick by brick, not because of some special spark or a deeply unique way of looking at the world.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Anxiety, tension, fear and anger are several states which involve effort and trying and interfere with the ability to "let go".   These states all involve a lot of mental activity. If one relaxes the mind then the mind will slow and eventually slowing becomes stilling when there is no more to let go of. In stillness, there is an absence of disturbance that prevents these states mentioned above from existing. You know of the calm after finishing this type of meditation. Being calm helps to avoid taking on or responding to others concerns with effort. In ease, the letting go is able to continue. This allows one to feel empathy which is a precondition for other emotions\\actions in response to circumstances whether that be kindness, gratitude or other feelings\\actions. 

These ideas from the method of the late Dr Ainslie Meares. Refer his books for details.</div>

For example:  
Instead of saying *“This house is red,”*  
say *“Isn’t this house red?”*

That way, you're giving the other person a chance to reflect, not just react. It doesn’t come across as pushy or confrontational — it feels more like a shared observation. People are much more likely to agree or reconsider their own view when they don’t feel challenged directly.

That should work for every topic.</div>

Lady, you are in Russia. A country that is notorious for purging their top minds, and throwing their best talent into the meat grinder. You probably should have done a little bit more research before moving to Russia. They probably already assume only a CIA asset would be stupid enough to move from America to Russia and volunteer to join the Army. They're going to throw your husband under the first drone that comes overhead.</div>

There’s an element of American exceptionalism at play here too, ironically, like they believe that just being American would confer some status or security on them.  You want that, lady, you gotta make a blockbuster movie like Under Seige first.</div>

In the short run popular wisdom suggests the better-paying artisan trades - electrician, plumber, welder, etc. If there's a flood to such work, prices and thus wages will drop. In the long run I believe little is "safe." Perhaps new careers for humans will rise, but it's hard to see from here what they might be (hence the "Singularity" :-) ).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Any job that involves repairing supporting computer hardware and or software.  

Any job that you can see being critical to the function of robotics (From conception to design, support, installing machinery, general maintenance, (hydraulic equipment repair, installation, maintenance) 

Careers in electronics, machine shop work, or any other job that you can think of to install maintain and upgrade robotics and computer-based systems. 

Programmers particularly programmers who understand deep learning and other AI platforms, architecture and multi-level relational databases and database management.  Programmers are almost always required during the planning phase of any AI project.

Systems architects, Network architects and engineers are going to be a critical part of all AI systems.  And also generally very well paid jobs.

Been mine that all of AI is really designed to make people's lives easier however it does not mean it does not require a great deal of human intervention to get up and running and to maintain and keep running. 

For people working in more Hands-On or blue collar operations there will be more than enough work keep people busy and working for the next century towards more functional applications.  HVAC workers construction workers electricians, fire prevention like installing halon in server rooms metal workers who will construct the massive server rooms that will be used for cloud-based AI not to mention all of the infrastructure like network cabling security jobs both computer and physical security that is and many other jobs.
