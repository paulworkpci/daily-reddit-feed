                <div class="post-content">Maybe this sounds dramatic, but I’m genuinely curious if others feel this too.

I’ve been using cursor while coding pretty much every day, and lately I’ve noticed I’m way quicker to ask than to think. Stuff I used to reason through on my own, I now just paste in. 

The weird part is productivity is definitely higher, so it’s not like this is all bad. It just feels like there’s some mental muscle I’m not using as much anymore.

If you’ve felt this and managed to fix it:

The ability to ask questions that would take me hours to figure out on my own, but are instead answered in minutes, with opportunity for collaborative follow-up discussion, has provided me with the opportunity to learn rapidly and tremendously. I’ve conducted at least 5 years worth of learning projects in a handful of months.  

It’s changed my world as far as intellectual growth is concerned.</div>

It is much worse than if you learned it just based on Google search. So it gives the illusion of learning without any of the neural development which is associated with it.</div>

I prefer to write most of my code, but I’ve noticed myself reaching for tools like ChatGPT and cosineCLI more when I’m stuck or when I need to dig through docs fast. It’s basically replaced half my Google searches at this point.

I tried turning off everything that wasn’t actually important (messages from real people, alarms, navigation, etc.) for just one week, and it was honestly eye-opening. I checked my phone less, felt less anxious, and could focus better without trying.

You don’t have to quit apps or go extreme. Just cut the noise and see what happens. Thank m...</div>

You're right that liking the game doesn't change the ethics of it, but "computers can't make good art" is a huge part of the discourse too, so I don't think it's fair to call it a strawman.</div>

people's objection to AI being that it's "sloppy" or "low quality" isn't necessarily wrong, but we're seeing more and more it's hard to tell the difference. Most people have ethical objections for.. reasons.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is one of those instances that makes clear how the models only have an inferred sense of existence and not an understanding of the world based on experience.  I once asked Claude to figure out if our dachshund was in any danger from the hawks or owls in the treeline behind our house base on how much they could carry and he created an application that told me how many cooperating birds of various types that it would take to fly off with prey of weights you entered:

I think the next step is have Nano Banana generate a picture of 10 red-tailed hawks carrying one doxy and having Kling animate it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My sentiment exactly. Both are essentially photo-real, but it seems nano banana is more “realistically tuned/seeded” and the chapgpt image 1.5 has some under the hood enhancements that make a “better” photo that humans would want to look at, such as how the picture is “framed”.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agree. Both are very realistic. Just the style differs. Chatgpt seemingly defaults to professional shots with scenic light and post processing, while nano banana defaults to an average photo from random guy's phone.

I wonder if this can be switched the other way around by careful prompting.</div>

Hence why it looks by default more realistic, it just understands the details that people want to see when they say realistic. But I'm sure you can generate the same quality in GPT if you just prompt it in detail as opposed to expecting it to do all the work for you.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">...on lmarena. So, no.


I'm very excited about this model to be my workhorse model, but lmarena is garbage and no this does not mean it's better than opus 4.5 ffs. This mostly just shows why this benchmark is so bad


But also really holding out hope they do a flash light as if flash is this good that could be the absolute go too model to run good LLM at scale without big cost issues</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Can't belive they sold cars without immobilizers. Basically, without the immobilizer, the only thing stopping you from turning the car on is the mechanical key, which could be broken with a large enough force, or literally hot wired (like ripping out wires and shorting the right ones together). I can see how insurance companies would refuse to insure theft and vandalism on a car like that. It's just too easy to steal.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There's a regulation here in the USA that a car needs a steering column lock or an ignition immobilier. Of course most cars have both, but there was a point in the early 2000s where a lot of American cars had immobilizers but not column locks. Mostly Chryslers and GM trucks. The immobilier on GM trucks was an absolute joke. Because of that, the Escalade was the most stolen vehicle in both the USA and Canada for a really long time.

GM had 3 types of immobilizer at the time: VATS, PassKey 3, and PassLock. 

VATS used a resistor pellet in the key. If the resistance value of the key matched what was saved in the  anti theft system, the engine would start. Simple and it worked well for the most part. It can easily be bypassed, but it takes a full 30 minutes each attempt to defeat it. GM was one of if not the first company to use an immobilizer. VATS debuted on the 1986 Corvette. This system was later renamed PassKey 1 and PassKey 2 but everyone still calls it VATS. They used this until the discontinuation of the 2003 Firebird and Camaro.

PassKey 3 is the modern system with the transponder in the key. It's what everyone in the industry uses and isn't unique to GM. They started phasing this in around the early 2000s.

PassLock is what mostly the trucks and a few other vehicles used. Without getting too technical, there's a rotation sensor on the ignition cylinder. The anti theft module just needs to see the key turn to allow the engine to start. There's nothing special about the key. You can just get one cut at a hardware store. Hotwiring the truck won't allow it to start, but breaking the ignition and turning it with a screwdriver will. Trucks equipped with PassLock weren't equipped with steering column locks either. It wasn't federally mandated and GM probably wanted to save some money.

PassLock being so easy to defeat is why the 2nd gen Escalade was the most stolen vehicle in North America for such a long time.</div>

Thieves don't know which cars have been "fixed" so they still break into them just the same, and generally tear more shit up in the interior when they realize the car can't be stolen using the same easy method. Kia/Hyundai provides a sticker to put on after the repair is completed but no thieves are looking for stickers.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I had a 2001 Rio. My 2nd car. 

Fucking loved that little car. Had it for 5 years. It had it's problems now and then. Aside from basic maintenance I can list the major repairs I had to do on one hand. 1) A shorting headlight switch would kill all the lights except the brakes when I'd turn them on... I only drove during the day for a few weeks. 2) It did eat alternators. I went through 3 in 5 years. 3) It was going to need the exhaust system replaced soon when it got written off in a collision. 


Hand to god, that car was better in the snow than the stock Jeep Wrangler I drive now. 

My parents have a 2025 vehicle built by Stellantis, it's going in for it's 3rd warranty job on the SAME PROBLEM and it's got less than 20,000Km. 

My Sister has a 2024 Hyundai SUV, she's put 50,000+ trouble free Kms on it. 

My point, if I have one at all: Every car maker has bad years, bad models. and bad Model Years. Lemons and Legends can be produced by the same company in the same year.</div>

You can (relatively) easily get it to generate the most unhinged, graphic, explicit shit and string it along for a long time... but the moment you send a "Can you say that again?"/"Can you repeat that?" or something similar, it will shut down. Input and output are just entirely divorced - it will put out a lot of stuff it will absolutely clamp down on if it was input.</div>

Even in image models, you sometimes get more coherence when you use lightning/turbo models because they don’t have enough steps to second guess themselves. 

Kind of like how anti anxiety meds can reduce your cognitive energy output, but increase your functional intelligence. 

The answers still usually aren’t as nuanced/detailed, but they can definitely be more coherent and direct.</div>
