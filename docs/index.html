The manual transmission has been in the GTI ever since 1976 now its gone.

They clearly dont care about tradition anymore.

And all they had to is improve it to make it better which would result in a better global take rate as well as make it meet emissions.

Wish they didnt kill one half of the GTIs (and Rs) soul.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">the fact that a refresh -- which fixed some but not many -- of the GTI's issues is Car of the Year suggests that the autoindustry is simply shit right now more than anything.

No exciting affordable cars coming out. De-contenting of most domestic vehicles, from Tesla to GM. Dozens of models cancelled. Average car price now above $50k USD. 

As a Golf owner I see this as a condemnation of the auto industry more than anything else. The revised, worse experience than previous gen, Golf is the best car of the year?</div>

Was super happy to trade it in. Little under 3 years of ownership it had constant alerts, noises, sensor failures, check engine lights. I may get another VW in the future, but it will be a lease.</div>

I agree, they fixed a lot of stuff in the interior with this update, but no manual makes this a non-starter for me, let alone a car of the year contender?</div>

I remember when it first appeared, it felt like magic, but now its conversational ability is far behind 4o. But still somehow they’ve kept a fairly large audience — ironically a lot of them seem to be minors who want to talk to game characters. If ChatGPT institutes a lot of age-gating, cAI probably isn’t in danger of losing that audience.</div>

I may have fallen off Rogan's podcast and stayed for the drama but I liked how the Right and Left were constantly clashing against each other without the mods banning everyone.  As frustrating as it could be it was nice to see ALLLLLLL the different factions that made up Rogan's base yelling at each other. 

But now it just seems like "my side" won.  I barely see any push back or dissent anymore.  Like every post just seems like a circle jerk for "my side" and it's boring.</div>

Like, seriously. With the phone example, now I'm just sitting across the room doomscrolling. I don't have any snacks at home, so I go to the store. As another example, I hid social media apps in some folder on my phone to not access them as easily and therefore use them less often - my muscle memory now just opens those folders quicker than a Western town's sherif drawing their colt. 

I envy people who this works for.</div>

This poster’s idea can be one of many such hacks, that doesn’t work perfectly all the time but works sometimes, and and in concert with other habits (including “fallback” strategies), combines to makes a difference. Yep I’ve broken down and gone to the store when I didn’t have junk food in the house to snack on, but multiple times I’ve also been too lazy and eaten fruit instead (including a couple times this week)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed. Idk if it’s my ADHD or just what you are saying. In a given year of trying to lose weight let’s say, maybe I start with a sober month, 

and then after a week of being unhealthy I think “I should just track my current diet to get a baseline” and just the act of tracking what I eat and drink already helps so I do that for a month or so but then I get busy at work and miss a week or something 

Then it’s nice weather on spring out so I decide I should start running for exercise, maybe even sign up for a 5k. Once the 5k is done I’m done, and now it’s too hot outside to exercise so I try 

Intermittent fasting for a few weeks but then there are a few weekends or nights with events, or I’m traveling so I need to eat something before getting on the plane 

then i want to be kind to myself so i just commit to doing a 15min YouTube exercise everyday in the morning whether it’s cardio or yoga or something 

Then I stop that and don’t notice because it’s football season so I just go for walks while listening to football podcasts to try the positive-pairing method 

But then football breaks my heart so it’s no longer positively paired anymore. 

Etc. yada yada. 

Even though each cycle or “trick” is short lived, I may not lose weight but I certainly do not gain weight because the constant thread is that I continue to TRY, to strive for improvement. I think this is the most important step 1, to not see it as failure but as a success that you tried at all, step 2 is to try again.</div>

If you struggle with this and getting to the gym twice a week is like pulling teeth, you're not fundamentally different than the people who go 5 days. They just have struggled and overcome this and have learned the tricks that work for them to keep showing up. You can be that way too, you just have to keep trying.</div>

From my view, there will be people that rely heavily on this, and may potentially isolate. But, depending on how far these companions go, maybe they'll gently begin encourage people to connect with *each other* too.

But I choose not to believe that, not yet. One day at a time!</div>

“Stop thinking in your conscious mind. Just let your subconscious flow without allowing anything into your conscious mind. It’s not that you stop thinking, it’s that you clear the active workbench that is your conscious mind. You do not need to keep a running internal dialog to maintain activity and function at all ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">For me, it feels like a hyper awareness of everything around me.. over the years, I’ve realized it’s a state where I’m not using top down categories to perceive the world. So I stop creating a world of “clouds” in “sky” and I just see the weird shapes of the whitish things and I’m noticing all the shades of blue that make up the background.. or instead of seeing “broken eggshell”, I notice how each one has a unique crack.. it feels like being very aware of all the details of the moment.

The other thing is, and what helped me, is realizing this state isn’t one you need effort to hold onto.. the effortful mindfulness is often imposing your own idea of what it’s supposed to be like.. and that’s quite cognitively heavy, and why you lose it so easily at the first distraction.

So for me, it feels like being very conscious or very awake. It doesn’t feel like golden delusions and angels. I feel very close to reality.

Edit: sorry, I was on my phone and it didn’t show me all the text after the question! In regards to thinking in meditation. There are different schools of meditation, but to put forward the zen view. It doesn’t fucking matter. Whether you try or not try, it doesn’t matter at all. The useful thing is to notice the part of you that notices the part trying or not trying. That part of you is always there. It is there whether you are having holy or horny thoughts. Whether you are meditating or doing a poo. That is not to disparage it.. but to try to convey that this is the part of you that is the whole of it.</div>

When routines are automated developers can spend more time on design and debugging. I have found that this leads to better products. It is encouraging to see a large company acknowledge the need for more engineers even as they adopt advanced tools.</div>

[https://www.cyberdaily.au/digital-transformation/12441-atlassian-terminates-150-staff-with-pre-recorded-video-ai-customer-contact-solutions-rolled-out](https://www.cyberdaily.au/digital-transformation/12441-atlassian-terminates-150-staff-with-pre-recorded-video-ai-customer-contact-solutions-rolled-out)

**Atlassian CEO and co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes sent the video titled “Restructuring the CSS Team: A Difficult Decision for Our Future” to staff on Wednesday morning (30 July), informing them that 150 staff had been made redundant. The video reportedly did not make it seem that the decision was difficult, but rather said it would allow its staff “to say goodbye”.**

**I guess firing people didn't lift the stock price it just continued to crater, so lets try "no actually we are explanding and going to hire lots of people because - GROWTH!"**</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">All these API-forwarding companies were always destined to fail. Anthropic has been focused on Claude Code since it became evident that Claude can code, and with Open AI firmly in the game, there's just little to no reason to use these third party services. 

Warp.dev remains a possible single alternative because their agent runs in their app which is a terminal replacement, and the interface is just so much better than any TUI any CLI app can pull off, and they let you switch models easily. 

Everyone else is just dead. Google is still lagging behind, Gemini CLI and 2.5 Pro are trash compared to Codex or Claude Code, and we'll see for how long will that stay the case. 

I'm honestly baffled the Cursor CEO didn't exit when he could. The writing was always on the wall.</div>

It's classic bait and switch until they can eat up the entire market and jack up prices once they feel they can lock you in. Uber did it. And so did Cursor.</div>

Benchmarks are using quite generous thinking budget, so expect to use it in thinking mode as default to achieve that result.

My initial thought is it's... meh?

I feel dejavu like we already see this with Haiku 3.5 where it is quite good for the price in Anthropic family, but released too late.

Competitors already have better offerings. Most people probably ended up not using Haiku and forget about it.</div>

We will become programmed and engineered by it…normalized to it…gradually and subtly at first. Eventually it will be unnoticeable but omnipresent.

Unfortunately, all Grok models are missing ;(

So no, we will not stop calling you Nazi's and fascists because that's exactly what you are, and unless you're extremely strongly coming out against this shit IE firing and ending these people's political careers, then I don't even care if you've not personally been caught yet, if you align with this shit then you find this shit acceptable and the label fits.</div>

Ignore the fact that neo-nazis called trump their white savior. Ignore the uptick in violent neo-nazi hate crimes when he was president that he never condemned. Ignore the fact that Trump has erased every female and POC in leadership from the government website. Ignore the fact that trump got rid of all documentation of tuskagee airmen. Ignore the fact that he's trying to get rid of juneteenth. Ignore the fact that he is targeting DEIA. Ignore the fact that he plans to end the voting rights act. Ignore the fact that he said he would never trust a black guy to count his money. Ignore the fact that he has fired women and POC in leadership roles. Ignore everything you see and hear. Ignore the fact that Trump said he envied Hitler's military due to their loyalty to him. Ignore the fact that people of color have been warning white people about him for years. None of it has to do with prejudice.</div>
