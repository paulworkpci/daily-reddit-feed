With AI the biggest issue is context within complexity. The main complaint you hear about AI is “it’s so easy to get started but it gets so hard to manage once the service becomes more complex”. Our solution for that has been context engineering, rule files, and on a larger level, increasing ...</div>

The issue with this is that the downsides of this sort of architecture are not yet able to be alleviated with LLMs. The cognitive load will still be there for the developer because of all the handholding you need to do even when working on a narrow scope. 

&gt;You get all the benefits that we wanted out of highly distributed systems with the downsides mitigated. 

You fundementally don't in my opinion. With what I said above, you have 2 approaches for dealing with the cognitive load of a complex web of interconnected microservies: it's either shouldered by the developer or shouldered by the LLM. If it's the former, the same issues with traditional microservices persist. If it's the latter, that cognitive load when translated into LLM usage equates to context. So we're back to square one essentially.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’ve found that LLMs can do well with high level context when asked general questions about relationships or functionality. Tools like Cody like I mentioned. But not when asked to make targeted changes based on that very high level understanding. Just like an engineer who generally understands that this service sends information to this one for analysis can’t necessarily go make changes to the function performing that analysis. 

But if your tool (Cody in this example), can tell you that you do indeed have X service for performing that analysis, and then you can ask another tool (say Cursor) to perform the very focused update or enhancement needed on that very small, easily understood service, you eliminate the need for any context beyond input and output in theory.

And it is indeed a theory completely. There’s every chance I’m wrong but it’s a very interesting idea that I think at least warrants discussion</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is what it should be actually, at-least on code files, modularity is the key.

Breakdown your large codes so that agent AI doesnt need to read unnecessary codes, but be careful not to to do it in a way where it takes lots of function calling to reach your code/logic.

And proper code documentation, i think for every feature there should be a living documentation specifically for agent AIs. Every update on a feature, make a rule that agent should update that doc also.

No context engineering can help us if we let agent understand just from the code itself. The documentation should include business logic, goals, edge-cases, previous bugs, etc...

When i meant documentation, something like \`AGENTS.md\` on each feature folder, this is easy if your folder structure is based on \[feature-sliced design (colocation)\](https://feature-sliced.github.io/documentation/docs/get-started/overview) where related files on a feature is under the same folder.

Example in Adonisjs backend project, by default if you have a feature, you need this files: \`controller.ts\`, \`service.ts\`, \`model.ts\` and optionally \`validator.ts\`. Normally each of those files are on separate folders \`Controllers/\`, \`Services/\`, and \`Models/\`. They're not co-located. Example:  
\`\`\`  
Controllers/  
├── journal\_controller.ts  
└── auth\_controller.ts  
Services/  
├── journal\_service.ts  
└── auth\_service.ts  
Model/  
├── journal\_model.ts  
└── auth\_model.ts  
Validator/  
├── journal\_validator.ts  
└── auth\_validator.ts  
\`\`\`

If you follow feature-sliced design, you do it in a way like this:

https://preview.redd.it/ix7wuk6nstqf1.png?width=572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfcc153ca7be8b239ba24d154b04c6b1d4537920

now you can easily add [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) on each of that feature folder. I was using feature-sliced design way before agent ai became mainstream because the files you needed are already co-located, now it's more agent AI-ready.

Been using it for frontend and backend, even on mobile codebases like Flutter.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">But if your system was so distributed that you can just point the AI at a single function and say “change the output from X to Y given the same input” almost no context is needed. This was the driving force behind highly distributed systems in the first place. You could hire a brand new engineer and they could make changes with very little context or knowledge of other areas. Sure you need senior and staff folks to understand the larger architecture and plan the work, but the junior engineers could make changes easily</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">In my opinion, this is the way.

Vertical slice architecture contains sufficient context to make all the changes.

Each is self contained enough to prevent the agent from breaking the entire system.

Along with good test coverage, it significantly de-risks the process.

Personally, I am using Elixir for everything again. It basically renders microservices unnecessary, it's baked into the language.

Also the web framework, Phoenix, is highly opinionated towards vertical slice architecture (phoenix contexts). It's not feature based, it's domain based, which I love.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Your point about architecting systems for AI resonates. I’ve been approaching the same context problem from the workflow side instead of the architecture side. 

I am currently developing something in which the AI code editor (windsurf) is doing all the coding part. For me what has worked is creating extremely detailed **Product Requirements Document** (markdown), and adding all the necessary markdown files if provided by the library specifically made for **LLM's** which will help the **LLM** to understand and get more context of the project and the tools/library that i am using. 

Also for most of the "prompting" part most of the time i am using gemini which i got free trial for a month, i used to use **Chat Gpt** but currently switched to **Gemini** and its proving to be good. Most of the time is spent to craft highly detailed prompt and i break down the prompts to get proper results. And also i am opening one chat per feature which is helping the ai code editor  to not hallucinate. Hope this helps.

This approach doesn’t redesign the system like you’re suggesting, but it tackles the same challenge: reduce hallucinations by narrowing the context and making things explicit.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A few years ago, comedian Duncan Trussell warned Rogan that powerful people would use him and his podcast to push their narrative. Now that people like Marc Andreesen and Peter Thiel are doing literally that, Trussell has backtracked and started defending those powerful people. Some of Trussell's fans are apparently harassing him for that.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Okay adding full context since I guess most commenters here don't listen to Duncan's podcast.

So essentially:

1. Some fans (and some "fans") of Duncan's have moved away from him because they view him not confronting Joe over his right leaning views as immoral or sell out behaviour

2. The YouTube channel Elephant Graveyard has, in recent months, put out some trending humourous, but also insightful videos on the Austin comedy scene, the decline of Joe Rogan's podcast quality, and by extension, the connection between the "right wing" Austin bro comedy scene and MAGA. Additionally, making claims of it exploiting certain groups for cheap laughs, and a "boys club" type of unspoken behaviour.

3. Duncan Trussell, being one of Joe's close friends and within both his same Austin scene and the same podcast circles, was also criticised in EG's videos for how he was perceivably changed over the years, claiming he was a voice of reason and now has become more of a sycophant. Additionally, an extra layer of unhinged people have also seen him attending Peter Thiel's lecture that has a heavy theme around the Antichrist, as him pushing Thiel or being paid to do so, but all he did was attend.

4. On today's episode of Duncan Trussell's podcast he had to draw attention to how unhinged that second group of "fans" I mentioned above is. And they have been sending death threats and harassing both him and his family. Which is much more concerning given recent events.

5. The post above was posted by Elephant Graveyard denouncing the people harassing and threatening Trussell and his family and calling out this behaviour.

I don't think Trussell or Elephant Graveyard have done anything wrong whatsoever, and I agree with both of them that no one should be harassed, especially to the point of threats.</div>

Duncan just went ahead and installed Rogan's firmware update willingly.  He shouldn't be harassed, just ignored.

                                <div class="reply-body">Seeing Duncan fade away into one of these drones bums me the hell out. I really enjoyed a lot of his stuff. He was a great comedian, had a fun podcast, and his Midnight Gospel episode with his mom was something I really needed when someone close to me passed away. Now the dude doesn't even look like or talk like himself; he's become a Simulacra of himself. I really hope he gets better one day.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">   Why do people in Singularity reddit wait for bubble to pop so much? why aren't they waiting for actual singularity to happen instead? 

   Its nice to have conversations and to listen opinions from both sides, but lets keep it civil, its Singularity reddit, so seeing 50%+ of comments waiting for tech that could lead us to singularity to pop up is kind of lame...  There are lots of other subs for this.

   News that Nvidia is investing into Ai company and that it could move Ai research much faster is kind of cool, right?... don't search only for negatives.</div>

Bubbles are not free money hacks, not at the end phase. They choke actual productive market forces in favor of griefters who will make the value disappear.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This woman IS part of your spiritual journey. 

Spirituality isn’t just what you do when you’re meditating or enjoying a minimal life of solitude. 

Spirituality is how you engage with the messy, complicated world as a human being. And how you deal with complicated, challenging, delightful and not always delightful other human beings. 

So this is what life and your choices have brought you. You have an opportunity to learn from this and to grow from this and take the next steps. 

Can you take those next steps from a place of self-care and self-understanding? Don’t punish yourself. You are where you are. This is the situation that has evolved for you. 

You can now choose where to go. And choose FROM that place of spirituality which is still with you. This woman represents something to you, a challenge perhaps, something you are grasping and maybe need to let go of.

If that’s the case, let her go. Drop the burden. </div>

spirituality also allows to see things with perspective from above, as it grants an access to an higher self... 
it can be used as a super medium between ourselves and life obstacles.

She cheated on you and disrespected you in the relationship, but you didn’t do anything wrong. I wouldn’t take the opinions of someone who is disloyal and disrespectful and you shouldn’t either. 

Your friends are there to support and help you, if they are not doing that then they are not your friends. You have a lot of anxiety about the situation which is normal, but you have developed some unhealthy thought patterns about what your friends think/feel. They are not judging and laughing at you. They have suggested you leave this person and I agree. They are unhealthy and you would be better without them. 

Try to go back to your life before and meditate. You should see this as an experience that will make you better because you learned from it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hate to point out the obvious but this is spiritual rocket fuel. You literally can't progress on the path without pain to propel you. Pain expands consciousness. No pain you just lull back into the dream world like you did. Sit with it, go full hermit. Dump all pleasures, meditate. Learn new ways to dissolve the new pain. She is where she is, which seems to be at a fairly low consciousness and she cannot do other than she did. Everyone cannot do other than their level of consciousness until they expand. In two years time you'll be thanking her. Probably need to start running or something too if you don't already. Trust me the path is there 🙏</div>

Pain is in some cases what's necessary to start the journey, but the journey has not truly begun until you're walking it because you want to, not because pain is forcing you to. That is only the first stage, where you are still not truly committed.</div>

Before, if you didn't want politics in your life all you had to do is not buy the news paper or watch the news. Now it's unavoidable and front and center usually. 


But yes... Before Trump it felt like politics was boring and quiet. Just like I prefer it. </div>

How many instances of an action movie do you need to see before you're done watching action movies? Because there's a number that can be assigned to that. After which, yeah you'll notice the variation and occassional novelty but it won't be interesting anymore. And then realize that on a long enough timeline that kind of thinking covers absolutely everything you can imagine being interested in.

"What, like living forever is like being on holiday every day, right?"

The real issue I'd have with that kind of talk is that it pretends like not having the option is somehow better or that if your life is going well somehow you only need 80 years of it. I understand wanting a limit but I think 80 years is a bit low unless you just had to accept that due to just being how things are.</div>

However, won't these robots then make the same assumption about us?

not to mention, when future AI see this in their data sets, it's gonna get them thinking about the relationship of automata to humans...

I predict nothing good comes out of this.

They have very affordable token pricing compared to Claude and GPT, and they often perform decently in reasoning benchmarks. But I’m wondering—does anyone actually use them for serious coding?</div>

They just now issued a recall for the powertrain not working.  I've been dealing with that for a year and every time the answer is "there's no fix yet, turn it off and on until it works".  A year to admit the vehicle just can't vehicle, but it's still not fixed.</div>

You might think this girl looks safe enough, but her helmet is a little too far back.

Surprisingly, it matters. 

Helmets are more effective when the pointy bit points straight forward (rather than slightly upwards).

The impact of a collision can push your helmet back more than you’d expect, so having your helmet angled increases the chance that your forehead will eventually hit whatever you’ve collided with. There’s also a higher chance you’ll get choke...</div>
