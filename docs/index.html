The thing works as a proof of concept it's just painfully slow. In the time it would take to copy and paste my password, and the 2 factor, I could have been done faster just doing it myself.

However, it's easier now to see this functioning natively on a logged in browser. Once that happens this really will speed things up, a lot. And sites won't be able to blanket ban because the hits are coming from the user's own browser.

I assume we'll see native browser integration in less than a year from someone. If no one else will do it I'm virtually certain Elon will.</div>

It now gets extremely difficult mathematics questions o3 had a 0% success rate in correct/very close to correct and is significantly different stylistically to o3.

UCLA researchers use prompting and self-correction to get gold medal in 2025 IMO with Gemini 2.5 Pro (which was released months before the competition took place) You can read their methodology yourself to verify it does not give the model any hints on what the answer is: https://www.alphaxiv.org/abs/2507.15855?s=09

For reference, Gemini 2.5 Pro only gets 13/42 points without any additional prompting. A bronze medal is 19 points and a gold is 35 points. https://matharena.ai/</div>

Update #2 - it got an even more difficult question right and did it very briefly with a perfect counter-example. [https://chatgpt.com/s/t\_68842c7357e88191898d79d28af40819](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68842c7357e88191898d79d28af40819)

For whatever reason the prompt doesn't show on ChatGPT, so to clarify it was "The \\textit{repeat} of a positive integer is obtained by writing it twice in a row. For example, the repeat of $254$ is $254254$. Is there a positive integer whose repeat is a square number?"</div>

Firstly, I need to login to activate the membership. Have done more than 20 today. You can literally ask anyone here who Dmed me.   
Secondly, Its Calm App what in gods name would I do with that.   
Thirdly, yes I am looking for a new job and it was a humble request that if you know someone who can help me do let me know. It was not a requirement. 

P.S. I even went out of my way to give that person a personal ID password but guess what the world doesn't value kindness.</div>

Saying the answer had "directly conflicting evidence in peer reviewed literature" isn't all that meaningful in a vacuum. I can genuinely find peer reviewed literature that claims there is an association between vaccines and autism.

                        <div class="comment-body">I played a role in curating some problems for the Humanity’s Last Exam benchmark (particularly in mathematics/computer science) so I have some insights.

From my experience, the review process for creating these problems seemed rather hasty. Typically, we had some academic person A coming up with a problem to be tested against some SoTA LLMs, and it would then be sent for review if and only if it stumped at least some models. 

After the problem passed this initial assessment, it would then be added to a spreadsheet where other academics could review the work. Each problem could only be assigned to at most one other academic. 

If this reviewer deemed the problem to be good, it would be sent to QC for final review… but this person likely did NOT have the required subject expertise to answer the question without external help.

Therefore, there were really only two academics reviewing any singular question, hence the issue…</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">So….. if you can’t do something any rational coach will help come up with an appropriate scaled option.

I don’t know why they’re so worried about how many calories you specifically are doing but it sounds like there may be some other context here?  Any history of butting heads with this person?  

And yes, while I don’t know what specific kind of rower / bike you all are using, but 12 cal on a concept 2 rower is different than 12 on an assault bike.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, they're different, but not that different. Even then, most people can get 12 cals done on a bike faster than a rower if they're willing to suffer a little. I'd also argue that the workout has a lot of grip intensive stuff with the C2B and cleans, so adding rowing makes it harder. 

At the end of the day, the coach, as described, was wrong. If an athlete wants to do something and that something is safe and close to the target, it's fine.</div>

Somewhere around 1985-1990 got on the last chopper in terms of having enough invested to retire and weather this upcoming societal upheaval.

I could've retired at 40 if the moneytrain kept going for another decade but now I'm utterly fucked and destined to be part of the permanent underclass. SWE was the only job I was decent at and can do.

I am 80% certain that I will no longer be employable as a software engineer in any capacity by January 1, 2028. 50% by January 1, 2027.

AI is so exciting but terrifying at the same time. We can only pray that AI causes insane deflation and everything becomes largely abundant, because it's pretty much over if not.</div>

So will basically everyone else, if you must put a label on it. The idea money made prior to an intelligence Cambrian explosion, will have great value, is kind of insane.


Should it come to pass, space mining and other drivers of wealth creation, currency of today will be rendered effectively worthless. For a transition period, sure accumulated wealth should help, but that's not permanent.


Put another way, if a remote ancient tribe was discovered, and they went ahead to integrate fully into modern civilization - just how valuable do you think their former stores of wealth would be? </div>

But it'll be too little to live well on. We need to talk about Universal High Income :)

That could honestly be an easier sell. You hear UBI, you might think that's other people mooching off your taxes. But you hear UHI, well that's you getting rich (with everyone else).</div>

I stole a trick from someone here that works ok. Before each task ask it to give two (or three) possible approaches with one of them being radically simpler. 

You still gotta kinda know what you’re doing though. Even if you start on the right path it can accumulate junk code if you’re not watching diffs.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This method works great, and I play the LLM against one another for this - one will make a proposal with a few suggestions, and then another will validate those and offer an alternative. 

When implementing slightly more complex features, I think the trick here is: you might have interplay between the database, the frontend and the backend. The various options help cement the context better. They are less likely to try and use a column in the database that doesn't exist, or a fake class, or open the wrong file, etc.; since they have had 3+ rearrangements of much the same data.

Similarly, even if I am referencing an .md file or two that covers crucial stuff, I will reference those things specifically in the prompt (stuff like... If you need psql, reference the .env) - I can put that same instruction across EVERY .md file, and have it ignored, or vaguely reference in the prompt for 90%+ compliance.

I will also reword the problem a few ways. I have been on the other side of this my whole life: client or PM who doesn't understand programming will be asking me for something - not by telling me what they want as an end result or what the problem is, but by saying something ENTIRELY UNRELATED. I try not to do that to the LLM by clearly defining what the problem and/or solution is, and WHY something is needed.

The difference between "can we put customers in a group on this map?" Versus "can we group customers on this map so that we don't have overlapping markers and can select between customers that are too closely grouped together?" Is night and day - not the best example, but there are swaths of problems like this that, if you approach them for a more 'this is what I want and the reasons behind it and what my end goal is', the LLM will usually deliver.

One of my favorite project managers I worked with (who was also non-technical...) used to kill me with this stuff on a DAILY basis, so it is easy for me to see the pattern.

9/10 she would say "Can you do (x)?", and I would always answer "I can do anything, if I wanted to... Why do you think we should do that?" And invariably, once the problem was described, (x) would always be some kind of backwards and inefficient approach to solving the problem - or implementing (x) would have not even gotten her what she wanted at all. 

Many people using these LLM are likely like that project manager, especially if I still slip up and sometimes make this kind of request mistakes, knowing full well the pattern.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Oof! That might take the cake right there on anything I could reference recently.

I had a model last night somehow botch moving an item on the menu SO BAD that it broke messaging, notifications and chat - across the project. It somehow removed one of the notification elements which caused a chain reaction to where the background services started all throwing "Too many requests" errors.

No big deal, I explained what happened and told it to restart to Node.js server in the background (the entire project is not Node.js, just those services), fix the issue and move on.

Well, it used the script to START the server, seen it was running, claimed it restarted the server, and when I explained that no, it did not restart the server, and no, the problem was not fixed, it took the liberty of deciding "well, let me just rewrite the Node.js"....

This was obviously very frustrating - if we were not editing the Node.js server at all, it was obviously NOT the source of the problem -_-;. I should have just rolled back the repo at that point but of course, I had several other agents working in that same branch on other, minor, related tasks. 

Ended up having to go in manually and close a tag that wasn't closed (that was seriously the root cause of the problem - the element the script needed was incomplete / missing, which caused some kind of feedback loop with the wss, checking constantly for data it couldn't put anywhere).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I've been wondering... is Veo 3 currently able to translate visual materials like a comic into a full scale movie? It'd be so cool if so. Comic artists can just make their own movies from their own homes if so. 

And maybe the same extends to fictional book writers</div>

Surprised this news isn’t mentioned anywhere so just sharing here. Won’t say the name of the company as it’s not my news to drop and don’t want to get anyone in trouble but just sharing what I heard. 

Will say they have over 10k employees and are not specifically in the tech industry. </div>
