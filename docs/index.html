It would take the best artists on the planet, the top 0.001% of photorealistic artists, a year, to produce what these systems can produce in seconds. 

The difference is the human artist could understand context and be a lot more specific abotu the composition and content of the image. But the actual quality of the output would be, at best, equal, but take 100000x as long to produce. 

By the same token(lol), no human could translate an entire pdf, or summarize it in seconds. It would, again, take them weeks, at best.

These systems fail in some ways we still excel, but they are superhuman in many other ways, and we don't know how hard it will be to patch in the stuff they still cant do better than us, but when we do, they wont match us, they have already exceeded us.</div>

No matter what technique I tried, my thoughts would only quiet down for a few seconds before rushing back. Honestly I started believing maybe I just wasn’t capable of real stillness.

Here’s the practice: instead of fighting your thoughts directly, shift your attention to the physical sensations of your body, especially the contact points like where your hands rest on your knees or yo...</div>

It’s written by two neuroscientist/researchers who are also meditators - and out of the 10+ years of meditating, this is the one book that finally made everything click.

Basically goes on about things like you said/pointed out. They call it “sense foraging”. And it’s all backed by legit research.

There are some parts where it talks and goes into detail about brain science-y things, but it helps make sense of how your brain and Default Mode Network (DMN) works and how to get out of your DMN.</div>

I do body scans- making sure to relax each area, slow box breathing while counting x4s in my head, or listen for sounds ex: cars driving by, air conditioning coming on, etc. There are a lot of little sounds if you focus on that.

                        <div class="comment-body">Small firms are more inclined to do those things. As someone who works for a retail network provider - small firms tend to make decisions based purely on cost cutting without the technical knowledge and often without foreseeing how certain decisions might be less cost effective. 

For an ai to perform the job of a single market analyst it could cost more than a human considering ai would need to adjust to an ever changing market. 

I think this is less a sign of “what’s to come” and more a sign of “small business wants to save costs so sees something that looks cheaper on paper and at face value and opts for it”</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I have different approach and view. Smaller companies are faster to adapt.

Usually such new technologies born new giants - smaller companies or newly created, ready to adapt faster.  I don't think it's something uncommon, new or shocking that it's small companies adapting AI faster. I can't imagine corporates doing half of the things we do in quite small business (gonna be about $7-8m revenue this year and 17 people).

Although, definitely many small companies will fail on the way as well. Most of them will adapt new technology incorrectly.</div>

What exactly was this analyst doing? Which tasks? How complex? How reliably?

Incredibly robust with how the people were messing with it and how it could overcome that. 

Then the fact that it’s actually moving and positioning its body dynamically to pick up all this stuff. 

Insane progress!</div>

 I really don't understand how Boston Dynamics robots still generate hype, we are not in 2018 anymore, the frontier has moved a lot. They can't even get cost-efficient robots after all this years.

Interestingly, Sam having seen hundreds of founders at YC, he may just be applying the fake it until you make it approach, let's hope he doesn't end up being the next Elizabeth Holmes / SBF. It sounds like he can keep raising, despite the org structure still being a question mark, so he should be able to keep going, assuming the GPT5 launch fiasco was just a hiccup. 

OpenAI failing may cause a mini, transitory AI winter, although it would make it pretty clear who would win once Spring comes around (Demis most likely, unless Dario gets most of the OAI diaspora).</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think what’s really changed is big time athletes don’t want their training/lives out there. If you think back to the 20teens, all those people were putting out cool videos of their teaming and day-to-day lives. Now, it’s all secrecy and highly produced videos clipped to leave out the training and personality. Makes its harder to connect with the athletes. There used to be much more “one of us” vibe that is now gone. Yeah I know, someone is going to give me a list of videos of “day in the life” or Hiller’s athlete profiles, or road to the games, but they aren’t the same and those aren’t the same.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Crossfits media team really deserves a TON of credit for the popularity of Crossfit. It was also a special time where online video was just blowing up. The media team was prepared to meet the demand and pump out consistent video content. Also many athletes would have their own videographers that would pump out their own content. 

Even if Crossfit hired back all the OG media team that they fired, they probably couldn't duplicate the success of the 2010's.</div>

They are not leftists or socialists, neither were the artists.

&gt;Though sizable, the Annenberg Foundation is a family affair. Publisher, diplomat, and philanthropist Walter H. Annenberg founded the organization in 1989. His wife, Leonore Annenberg, became President and Chairman after his passing in 2002.

This is standard capitalist tax write off money laundering that knuckledraggers will eat up as leftist money stealing, while playing into the hands of demons like Peter Thiel, who controls &amp; monitors the US now via Palantier and his stooges. The simple folk won't know better. Researchis 5D chess for most.</div>

The results:

- It can identify your diet with 87% accuracy from a single fart
- It learned there are only 7 basic fart types (all others are combinations)
- It started generating "fart symphonies" that actually slap
- It predicted the stock market with 52% accuracy (barely better than random but still)

Seems like someone has an agenda to push this normalization, which is a good thing I guess. (Or it’s organic, who knows.)

Edit: upon getting it to work again, it says:

"In terms of accuracy, I’m generally quite reliable in recognizing when I don’t know something—better to underclaim than overstate. But sometimes I might say “I don’t know” when, in fact, I could provide a reasonable answer (I err on the side of caution).

👉 Do you want me to break down how often I’m too cautious versus when I’m genuinely uncertain?"</div>

Unless the original question was true nonsense, this is setting a worrying precedent that any answer given by the bot is correct. And more people will blindly trust it.

                        <div class="comment-body">Alot of people see a scripted or possibly teleoperated fake-out, but I see great articulation and stability under self-power in a non-bulky format for an AI that could come later. It's still amazing progress for embodying intelligence even if it's only the body part. 

The downside is overestimating how much of the progress is on the AI side.</div>

Yeah, many people here don't know the Optimus is teleoperated.

I really wish the Optimus here didn't have to be teleoperated and was just autonomous</div>
