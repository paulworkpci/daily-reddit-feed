                                <div class="reply-body">As someone trying to lower the anxiety of a lot of people around me just hopping on the train I've been riding for a while:

It's not going to be just your job. It's not going to be just any job. Artists, translators, copywriters...

Everyone is going to be impacted for two simple reasons: if only a significant enough portion of jobs are completely replaced, then high enough unemployment is sufficient to impact the economy to affect everyone.

The alternative is that most jobs are replaced, in which case everyone is also affected but even more so: if you can't pay your mortgage, you have a problem with the bank, but if nobody can pay their mortgages, then the it is the bank who has a problem with everyone.

The third "option", for those who choose to believe, is that it's not a major change at all and only some jobs are going to be affected minimally. In which case you get yourself together and move on. Why believe this ongoing shitshow slowly descending into hell is better than significant change, I can't really understand but that is what some people want...

If you are, or have been, smart enough to keep yourself afloat so far, you're likely to figure it out in a new world order as well. If you haven't, then what's another fart to someone who's already shit themselves? If you're doing very well though, you are the one with most to lose. Those people are mostly not worried either due to ignorance or hubris though.

The day where AI can do all or most of your jobs, it will also be capable of doing a ton of others jobs.</div>

If you have a giant amount of intelligent AI's that are capable of being AI researchers / software developers / LLM researchers that can make something smarter than itself, this is probably the start of the singularity, IMO. We will see extremely rapid progress with so so many different things, in both the digital and physical world, such as humanoid robots

Colleagues are using A.I. to get a second opinion on 12 lead ECGs. Many physicians are now using an A.I. tool which listens to the conversations between the doc and and patient, and it’ll generate a patient care record off it, something that used to take a lot of time. Some A.I. narrators will also add suggestions, with things like “Have you asked about this? Have you considered this as a treatment?” It’s pretty crazy.</div>

You can see the full writeup [here](https://theaidigest.org/village/blog/season-recap-agents-raise-2k).

The results were both impressive and kind of hilarious:

Like a fractal... as above, so below. 

&gt;We appear to be separate, but the conclusion of this line of reasoning is that God is like an infinitely layered onion of universes with no beginning, middle, or end. It has no parts. We are simply One.

All is composed of the same substance \~ but all are also simultaneously distinct individuals. I am not you, you are not me, despite us both being composed of the same base substance.

The base substance can manifest in infinite ways, so everything can be quite different and sometimes even incompatible \~ at that layer.

It's like... everything is vibration, but negative vibrations conflict strongly with positive vibrations, creating an unhealthy disharmony. Things that resonate do so because they are of the same vibrational nature.</div>

The base rule should be that you do not accept abuse from others and that you won’t stand for it. How this is communicated should be adapted to each situation.</div>

You still have to be able to assert  you're not going to tolerate this. 


You're going about it a different way by giving the person an out. 


But that is still what is happening. You  have to be firm and aggressive in your response. 


That works for some people, unfortunately I am a child of Xbox Live and boy can I run my mouth.


A fight is a fight, literal or metaphorical and there is no better way to get someone to back off then showing you can hit harder. </div>

I've got to resort to copy pasting the [Reponses API doc](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) manually into the chat window or a file for the LLM to read because their own LLMs aren't even aware of the latest way to interact with OpenAI...</div>

Treading water is an essential thing to learn if you're planning on being in any body of water. Anyone can be pulled into quickly moving water or a deep body of water in an instant. A child can fall into a pool in the blink of an eye while wandering outside.

Please don’t do that. Treading is more work, yes, but that extra work, and your ears staying out of the water, MASSIVELY delays hypothermia.

If you’re actually in a circumstance where you’re waiting to be rescued, treading will save your life. Also, having your whole head out makes you more visible.

If you cannot tread, face float is better than nothing, especially if someone is less than a few minutes away, such as on a beach or in a lake/pool. But please, if you can, tread water.</div>

Grandma and Grandpa that you need to help press the green button to answer a call? These are the people who are drafting thousands of pages of legislation covering telecommunications, compute, and AI.

They are so outrageously in over their heads they don't even know how to ask the questions they would need to understand the basic terminology, in order to have the conversations they would need, to begin to grasp the issues they are literally passing laws about.

The Control Problem? AI alignment? They don't even know what these words mean much less have an informed opinion about the issue or a solution for any problem in any context.

They just do what their corporate sponsors tell them to do and collect their bribes. That's it. "Vote yes." And they just do it without even understanding what they are voting on.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I get that this is a common sentiment, but it’s clearly wrong. The average age of the US House is about 57. These aren’t boomers, these are Gen Xers who grew up with computers. And of course, much of the policy work is done by 20 and 30 somethings who certainly aren’t old. 

Yes, maybe it’s possible that the entire US government is just too dumb to grasp what random Redditors have grasped, or maybe AI people don’t have arguments that are convincing enough. No one is obligated to agree with you.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The goalpost at Anthropic seems to have shifted from solving AGI to solving SWE. An AI model that is able to write the majority of software to build a new software product, including itself, is still nowhere close to AGI. You could even argue that they're already there. That's how near meaningless it is.

And it's important to note that his last remark

&gt;so we can go home and knit sweaters.

in the context of his prior statement is referring to owners of Anthropic stock that are able to go home and knit sweaters. Not anyone else. Not related to UBI. Not related to AGI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is false. Anthropic has as a target goal to close the recursive loop. As someone that actually works in the industry it's bizarre how big of a disconnect there is between what people outside of the industry seem to know and predict and what people outside of the industry seem to think.

To give you some indication, most colleagues of mine think we will have closed the loop and be replaced in just 2-3 years from now. You have no idea how far along we are and how much is already delegated to AI systems. Every couple of weeks we make a breakthrough and delegate yet another piece of the process. This not only makes us more productive and faster to iterate but it also is the clear endgoal.

Once the loop is closed we will beeline straight to ASI, potentially the phase where we are at AGI will only last a very short time, probably without public release.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Mental illness often happens when you try to push down your emotions. You beat yourself up when you feel social anxiety, so in the future you become more anxious about social anxiety, hence making your social anxiety worse. I was stuck in this feedback loop for over a decade.

Meditation helps me catch myself when I’m trying to avoid my anxiety.

Instead of thinking “ohhh no I’m anxious right now! This is the worst time to be anxious because this girl is so beautiful!” I now think “it’s okay that I’m anxious”

Instead of thinking “oh no I screwed it up because I was anxious” I think “it’s okay that I screwed it up”

When you’re feeling those emotions, meditate on them and experience them fully. You’ll notice that they’ll eventually pass, making the next time a little easier.</div>

Apply the awareness and mindfulness you develop thru meditation

The space you create from your awareness and thoughts is crucial to understand, feel and express your emotions and feelings in a healthier way

One thing I learned, its also the same for positive emotions. Be sure to apply the same awareness when your body and mind is trying to feel them as well especially in expressing love, gratitude, appreciation and peace.

Can you elaborate on this? if I allow myself to feel these emotions then it usually just allows them to get a deeper grip on me. 

It's like letting someone inside your home when your goal is to get them out of your life completely. It just makes the connection even stronger.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It has actually. Through meditation it becomes clearer that most of our anxiety is caused by being lost in the past or future, in planning and remembering. Meditation helps to clear our mind, so we can catch ourselves when we are off lost in a stressful thought. When we are more present in the moment, we aren't worrying about what we should say or do next, or what people will think about us, so we become a lot more confident in every situation.

For example, I used to be quite shy and awkward, and I would get anxious easily. After I started meditating, I just felt a lot more free, social situations felt easier and more spontaneous, and a natural sense of happiness and clarity started to grow.

The ability to slow down and be present naturally makes us happier because all those worries and regrets about past and future have started to quiet down. This happens naturally when we stop following our every thought.

So through the process of meditation, we become less anxious, more confident and happier. These are all benefits, however they are not the point of meditation. The point of meditation is to begin to know ourselves more, and in that silence comes a wisdom that will be a wonderful gift in our lives.</div>

Even calling LLMs a simple word prediction tool is a vast oversimplification, especially given what the reasoning models like o3 can do.

Anyway, I digress. The guy is right that current AI can't be called "inspired" or "sentient", but he lacks imagination if he thinks *it must be* impossible for AI to achieve some form of those things, even if it takes many decades.

                        <div class="comment-body">I've been saying this since RAG first became the term used to describe the method. And you are exactly right, the whole reason it became a thing was because, back when context windows were 4k or 8k max, it was out of necessity. Now, in the age where context windows are 1M or 10M tokens, it only makes sense in specific enterprise cases where you have vast datasets to query for specific, isolated information.

Using embeddings and vector DBs for coding with codebases that can fit into context is a huge mistake, and it's mainly done by companies to save money for greater profits (like Cursor) at the cost of performance. Roo or Cline don't do it because it hurts performance, and it's your own dime.

I cringe when I see projects come up that brag about turning small personal codebases into "1500 layer vectorized embeddings to intelligently access the code that matters." To the uninformed, it sounds sophisticated and "better".

No, you are just needlessly adding a layer of complexity that tremendously hurts performance, adds points of failure, and gives incredibly unreliable or inconsistent results.</div>

A lot of the large context models drop off in accuracy after 100k tokens, anyway.

                                <div class="reply-body">AHH yeah you say that. But I've been messing around with different models for a while.

I used roo code with sonnet 4 today to do a large refactor on an app. 

Architect mode, to orchestrator, boomerang tasks etc. roo code blew 60 dollars and eventually I pulled the plug and started over. 

I did it again with built in cursor models swapping, I did improve the initial prompt to specifically address the issues we had on the first attempt. With a little more hand holding I got it done in cursors for less than 5 dollars of credits. 

One thing it does prove is that the quality of your prompt is still king. It's a tool to be guided nit does not replace engineers.</div>

I won’t lie, Dems suck, but not for the reasons Joe uses to justify himself and who he supports. 

And this won’t be an issue for the new sober Christian Joe Rogan. He’s going to say “maybe it’s not such a bad idea, maybe these things, drugs and alcohol aren’t conducive to a constructive society”.</div>

A friend recently asked for help with their community platform as he wanted to rebuild their clunky PHP forum into a modern React app with AI-powered content moderation and smart member matching. "Just something clean that actually works," they said.

Famous last words.

                        <div class="comment-body">This is why I continually say "vibe coding will steal jobs" is wrong.  If a dev just vibes in a lot of features, they end up with exactly what you described; a pile of slop features of which they have no idea how any work under the hood, or even where to quickly start debugging.

Making a plan is ESSENTIAL and I spend most of my time planning - both creating and refactoring plans - until I feel that it's following the architecture I want &amp; understand, each phase of the plan ends with something testable, and each step of every phase is small enough for me to review all the code after the LLM writes it.  All that goes in markdown files in a /plan directory in the repo.  I then have the planning LLM write me the prompt to use for the coding LLM that includes everything the coding LLM needs to know to understand what the project is, what the major phases are, what tools to use, what the tech choices were, and where the planning docs are.  Finally, I put that prompt into the coding LLM and ask it to ask me any clarifying questions.

As an example, I did this last night with a React Native app I've wanted to make for a while - it was 30 minutes of back and forth with the planning LLM (Claude Desktop using 4.0), then 5 minutes with the coding LLM (Zed's Claude 4.0 credits) answering questions, then I unleashed the coding LLM on the first phase.  20 minutes and 4 phases later I had my fully functional app - and most importantly - I knew exactly how everything worked.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">At that point, with all that planning, I feel like it would just be simpler to write the code yourself, no? 

I mean if I have to spend hours planning and refactoring plans, I’d honestly rather write the app myself.

It’s much easier for me to store the plan in my head and pump out code versus spending hours managing a complex knowledge system hoping the AI gets it, while simultaneously hoping to not oversaturate the context window. 

Like where’s the AI advantage here exactly?</div>
