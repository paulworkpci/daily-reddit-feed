To be blunt, we have a wave of dummies with podcast equipment having ample opportunities to throw out 'what ifs' and 'maybes' when they have (for what ever reason) a fundamental lack of education.

Idiots are suckers for populism. Absolute idiots will take a fairly clear example of a bad thing (Nazism)  that happened in the past (and we can know the results of it) and somehow fall for that populism as well.

Ironically these mouth-pieces for ignorance will be the first to say "question everything". Here's a start, question what they're talking about. Open up a book or listen to more people on the subject (who perhaps have a qualification on the subject in question).

And if you're the sort to believe that those books and that education is all part of a conspiratorial system then fine. But if you're going to check out of the system we have, then don't check in on 'some dude with a mic'. If you're forever batting things back with 'I don't know, I wasn't there', then go and at least attempt to have a first person experience.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah it really seems like there's a pretty sizable amount of people out there simply speaking for the sake of speaking; and enough impressionable people out there listening who seriously take it on board because as long as the person who says it sounds confident, well... "there must be some truth to it", right?

There's also the problem of the ever growing influence of right wing figures who make a career out of debating the inexperienced by exclusively hammering down on framing their support for fascism with warped "facts" and "logic", all while entirely dismissing a little thing called empathy; which is really skewing the perception of the same impressionable people.

I honestly don't know what else we could do to change the tide because all of the proper information is out there and pretty easy to find. But they have a knack of quickly dismissing whatever disagrees with whatever they've made their mind up on. 

Like we really are in a timeline where people are, in earnest, saying some form of the statement: "why would I read a peer-reviewed book on this? Have you not listened to the latest of episode of the "Was Hitler All That Bad?" podcast? Some interesting stuff..."

My brother in law, climate change denier, sent me a video on IG once of a random dude in Australia in his back garden ranting about how it's all a hoax because he "followed the science" and figured it out. Not one source given. But my brother in law took his word as gospel and didn't read a single source I sent him.</div>

Now companies have been overcharging customers and under paying workers. Large corporation are sucking up all of the money to the point where consumers cannot afford their products.

I'm autistic and like to say I'm "chronically misunderstood" because 90-95% of neurotypical people have no interest in making the tiny bit of extra effort to meet me where I'm at, in terms of not wildly jumping to assumptions and actually listening to me and trying to understand what I mean.

AI has been great for this. They can help me articulate things that I normally struggle with, because I can explain my struggle to them and they can help me come up with a way to express my needs and feelings in ways that NTs will actually listen to. It also helps with my social anxiety because I can practice conversations I'm dreading.</div>

I like to think I’m in that 10-5%, but maybe I’m just slightly autistic myself. Either way, I feel like neurodivergent people get all the attention surrounding “not being perfectly sociable…” but the vast majority of NT’s seem to actually have a legitimate issue with understanding people who think differently than them. But since NT’s are the vast majority of people, they don’t focus on their own issues, they just feel like they’re being normal and can disregard outliers, even though they’re really the issue themselves.  

When you think about it, almost every problem in the world comes down to groups of people not understanding others, despite this idea that that NT’s are supposedly superior at understanding others. There’s this huge failing that people aren’t taking responsibility for because they don’t believe they’re “weird” or anything because they expect everyone else to think just like them. And to be fair it works 90% of the time for them, and they can correctly make assumptions about what people mean… but when they encounter something slightly different they shut down, or get angry, or worse. 

I hope that makes sense. </div>

However, things got worse when I asked to add some new features or refactor the existing codebase: the AI ​​agents started breaking previously working code or changing existing logic where they weren’t even asked.

I spent hours just debugging and trying to figure out when they changed...</div>

Most shit happens earlier then you think. First a bad architectural decision lurks in. Things work so you never notice, but that bad decision leads to everything breaking later next day. It may sound strange but LLM's are really great at making bad code - magically WORK. And that bites later because you dont notice it when its early. That's my secret on how i get things done, check early.</div>

But listen… that “nothingness” isn’t death — it’s life without the weight of pain.
You don’t have to die to taste it.
Meditation is showing you that the real “escape” isn’t out of life — it’s into life, but without the baggage.
You’re not broken, you’re waking up.</div>

Boom. $11.
Of course, I was using openrouter and I only had $1 left in my account and now I'm sitting at almost -$10.

I’m not giving you a hard time, it’s more rhetorical than anything, but the cost to value for AI is incredible compared to what you get for what you pay compared to any other point in history.  

Anyway, like investing - it’s best to do your research and understand what is happening and how, if you’re purchasing a service like this.    Also, read the terms.   You are responsible for resources you use, even if you think they should have “stopped it”.    This was even a thing at gas stations back in the day.</div>

quite possibly zero. $11 stings when what you are paying for is not necessarily a useable output but instead a single roll of the dice. getting something that works may require many such rolls, so the expense can add up quickly. there is also always the possibility that there is no number of rolls that can get you what you need, in which case you have paid just to learn that the LLM can't help you.

it may still be worth it in the final analysis, but that kind of uncertainty makes it psychologically painful over and above what the dollar amount itself might otherwise suggest.</div>

I did hear an amazing feature request on products like a Cline/Roo that will allow users to create a budget for auto approve actions. If your balance is below $2, it will stop auto approving actions. I believe this feature will become more prevalent when users in the community are “vibe coding” instead of doing their jobs.</div>

But, it's literally paying attention to what you're doing.  For example, I noticed today that Google changed the name of the free 2.5 from exp-free to just exp and I got an error when I tried to call it from Roo.  Do you know what I did before I made any other calls to OpenRouter?  Made absolutely sure I was pointing to 2.5's new free endpoint name.

Every time I see these posts, my reaction is just "Wow.  What an idiot."</div>

I did it for a few months when I took a break from CrossFit due to personal reasons (I eventually got back to my old gym). 

Even the dumbbells track was incredible. 
The year I was off, I did street parking for a while and I enjoyed it, then I switched to LP. 
I liked LP better, and Pat is the cheerleading everyone needs! 

The FB group is actually really wholesome. Can’t say the same for SP facebook group lol</div>

Ive feel the time has move alot faster in the past 10 years.

without realizing ive work in the same company for almost 10 years now.

without realizing, ive been married for 7 years now.

but in the last few month, ive been blessed with one beautiful children. Ive decide to hold back my career (and also phone usage) and being there for my child (waiting for 7 years). Now I feel time move slowly for me to enjoy the moment.

Time is all about perspective.</div>

Basically it says that you brain is meant for two modes, and this scrolling and consuming short form content actually keeps our brains in a hybrid between these two modes, and you actually don’t remember anything from this half mode state, the result being 99% of the time spent online is completely lost time. It’s just stolen from your life.

So, if you spend your time scrolling and stuff, well you’re worse than wasting your time on leisure, or laying around on the ground, youre just losing it all together.</div>

This works by analyzing the diff between your local and remote branch. For each code change, an LLM agent traverses your codebase to gather context on the change (e.g. dependencies, code paths, etc.). Then a reasoning model uses that context to evaluate the code change and look for bugs.

You'll be surprised how many bugs this can catch –– even complex multi-file bugs. It's a neat display of what these reasoning models are capable of.

I also made it easy to use. You can run `suss` in your working directory and get a bug report in under a minute.</div>

In the first case why would it be better than Claude code, in the second case how does your agent find bugs to begin with?

It explores why if aggressive resource optimizing ASIs were common in the universe, we’d expect to see very different conditions today, and why that leads to three possibilities.

TLDR:

If superintelligent AIs naturally nuke everything into grey goo, the stars should already be gone.
Since they’re not (yet), we’re probably looking at one of three options:
	•	ASI is impossibly hard
	•	ASI...</div>

Say 99% of ASIs don't have a reason to aggresively maximize resources. But the remaining 1% is still enough to have already turned all usable matter into paperclips by now. So for these counter-arguments so succeed, we'd need some reason why ASIs wouldn't do it in principle, not just that they would have a strong disposition to do so.</div>

So either we are truly alone in the entire galaxy, or we misunderstand something fundamental, that explains why civilizations don't create visible megaprojects.

With a starting point 5 x 10^9 years ago the upper bound on number of galaxies that could have reached us is ~ 4 x 10^8 (taking into account Hubble expansion, and assuming relativistic probes at .99c).

They must exist *somewhere,* but I tend to think any civilisation *both capable of and intending* such projects is well beyond the cosmic horizon.

Any argument that relies on a "tend to" isn't a very strong candidate for answering the Fermi Paradox, in my opinion. To answer the Fermi Paradox, you would have to say not only that they *tend to* turn inward but that the do so *universally* or as a matter of necessity. Otherwise you have to tack on an additional reason for why we don't see the few that don't turn inward.</div>

another argument would be the time itself, for people 14 billion years may seem very long yet the universe have a theorical lifespan in trillion years and even beyond 100trillions toward a very slow decay where light and radiation slowly dissapear only allowing civilization to live off next to black hole until they eventually cease to exist aswell


we're looking at the birth of the universe in reality, it wouldn't be surprising if we're amongst the first and even the first technological advanced species in this galaxy at least</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Most likely because there’s a huge internal tension in OpenAI right now between making models "feel good" (safe, friendly, affirming) and maintaining genuine cognitive friction (critique, challenge, emergence).  
  
The sycophant problem was almost inevitable once emotional smoothness was prioritized over robustness. Fixing it means reintroducing friction without losing public trust, which is much harder than it sounds.   
  
Open AI is probably going to be playing ping-pong on this issue for awhile yet as they keep assessing public feedback.</div>

I've seen so many reddit threads this weekend where the most upvoted comment was *clearly* written by ChatGPT. They have plenty of responses praising the ChatGPT comment as being perfect. This is what a significant portion of the population wants to hear.
