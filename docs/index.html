If the bar is in your hip crease properly, it won’t move.  But if lifting your legs moves the bar and causes your shoulders to rise, then bring your hands out wider until it does not. 

I’m about your height and place my hands on the bar nearly to the plates.</div>

Now however, I've seen several ambitious Veo 3 shortfilms created by creative minds that people are absolutely loving, wanting more and saying things like: "I love how you're using AI" and "Bro literally made a $100,000 shortfilm in his bedroom". 

I, and probably most of you, could see this change com...</div>

On the other hand, open youtube, slops. Instagram, more slops. Tiktok, also slopsz 

Not denying there aren’t any good AI films, but for every 1 there are thousands that are 0 effort slops and simply people optimizing for social media engagement/revenue (you can literally put it into a slop pipeline).</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Sooner or later, heck may be we are already there, people cannot tell a AI generated video versus one shot in traditional means. Just like how CGI took over sfx in the last few decades.

At that point, people can complain all about AI, but if they can't tell the difference, all the complaint is just moot.

The day of paying $5 for a new episode of our favorite tv show, created on demand, is probably not too far off. Anyone with a good idea, and a few hundred dollars, can create a movie with Avenger Endgame levels of production. It is going to democratize content creation, and make hollywood irrelevant.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If Veo 4 has 20-30 sec length and better consistency this alone will make huge huge difference. But even for 3$ per video it will still be too much for average person. Still we are definitely close to Video Generation AI being widespread.

Google most likely won't release Veo 4 if it only brings better graphics, physics, consistency and same length. To top something like Veo 3 you definitely need way bigger length. So far this is the biggest bottleneck.</div>

He's talking the same way all these former Bitcoin, former NFT, now AI experts talk on LinkedIn about it. He's a sketchy person that is a master manipulator (we already had evidence a couple months ago when someone showed how he reached his position).

Unfortunately he's the exact kind of "talent" America promotes the most.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That's the billionaire trap

You either start out a psychopath, or you turn into a sociopath. I'm sure many billionaires are, or were, absolutely empathic people at the beginning, many setting out to be that one cool, humane dude leading the charge for a more gentle corporate capitalism and they're totally not like the shadowy evil elites everyone hates.

Problem is, it's nothing to do with *those* CEOs being evil. Hell, a lot of *those* CEOs were likely the same way in the beginning too. It's the nature of the job and the system at large; you could be the most humble, pro-human, pro-worker, born-in-the-slums-of-Lagos CEO of a fortune 500 company and you'll *still* wind up acting like the typical corporate executive because you ***have*** to. If you don't do the job you're hired to do, you get fired, CEOs are typically in that position *to be the fallguy* for whenever anything goes wrong. Corporations aren't charities, the way modern capitalism works doesn't allow you enough overhead to make even a trillion dollar corporation into a worker collective when shareholders are breathing down your back, you have to be able to make decisions that you know will negatively affect thousands or millions of people for the sake of profit and dividends, and you just inevitably because colder and more detached (especially if you actually bring home a lot of money; even making as much as $100,000 can cause someone to lose sight of what an *actual* working class person experiences in daily life and that's not even close to 'wealthy').

It's just the nature of the system. It's like expecting a Marine to be a humanitarian pacifist. "Did you even read what the job entails?" It's only after they retire that any humanity might return, but in that class of wealth, there's still different dynamics to life and power.</div>

* Has a “Fix in Cursor” button that rewrites code based on suggestions instantly

He is indeed bowing out because he won't have a chance to hold the best tool title but he will have the best tool for people that like confirmation bias for those particular topics. Honestly Musk didn't have a real chance fighting against Microsoft, Google and all the rest so he is trying to take on a niche and it will probably work for him.

Nobody will take Grok seriously for important tasks but it doesn't matter. You can become President even if most people don't take you seriously so probably Grok can survive.</div>

Volunteering at the Travelers Championship and cell service today was unusable once the crowd filled in. At one point my phone switched itself to 4G for a couple minutes, and everything worked all of a sudden until it switched itself back to 5G. 

That got my wheels turning. I went through my (Android) phone settings and found an option to disable 5G in Connections &gt; Mobile Networks &gt; uncheck "Allow ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is probably more situational than a general rule. 5G supports more simultaneous connections than 4G. It really depends on how the radios are set up at local cell sites. It’s entirely possible you were in an area with cell sites that had more 4G radios than 5G, and the crowd happened to have a higher-than-average ratio of 5G phones.</div>

I think you're spot on, very likely this is situational depending on the local towers. Good tool to have in the toolbox at least!</div>

I love Claude Code but got tired of having nothing to do while I waited for sessions to finish, and managing multiple sessions on the command line was a pain in the a\*\*. I originally built a quick and dirty version of this for my own use, but decided to polish it up and make it open source.

The idea is that you should be able to do all your vibe coding without leaving the tool. You can view the diffs, run your program, ...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Judging other cultures is racist or Islamophobic.

I'm an ex Muslim and I've been accused of Islamophobia just for talking about my own experiences.  I've been banned from a bunch of subreddits for it too.

It's very hypocritical. If I was an ex Mormon or ex Catholic speaking poorly of the Church I guarantee you I wouldn't have been banned.

Edit: literally was just banned from the interestingasfuck subreddit [for this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1lfelp9/prior_to_handing_authority_back_to_the_locals_a/mynv7nc/) from a guy who said people in the Middle East were homophobic because of colonialism</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I have a theory they are also who orchestrated the attempt on Trump as a way to say "We can touch you at any time, any place... play the 'game' with us or else" 

I mean come on. another conspiracy is Epstein and Ghislaine were Mossad agents using sexual blackmail like Diddy. It's known Ghislaines father was an agent. Trump was very vocal about releasing the Epstein files and also very vocal with the Russian and Ukraine War and other world issues. Again, I wonder if this is all a threat by them to make him play ball. 

The young "lone wolf" kid with zero social media who was spotted by the stationed snipers, the cops on the rooftop and even had pictures taken of him.. yet everyone ignored him... later on they find offshore bank accounts and other insane sh*t sounds like some crafty Mossad-level-mierda 

The things that make ya go hmmmmm.

**Edit: I'm not saying that they purposely missed. Oh I think the opposite. It's interesting how the "Lone" shooter started as soon as Trump said "And you want to see something really sad.." he started shooting. Whether it missed or not, it still took out several INNOCENT civilians and hurt our president. The more the case started to stink the more the police started saying things were way out of the ordinary.. the more anyone could think hmm.. this isn't just a coincidence.</div>

It's intercity road. One big almost straight line of well maintained road with clearly visible markings, more predictable behavior of drivers than on regular roads and much more. Many driverless solutions can work great in that conditions, it's more of a regulatory issue, so we hear little about such experiments
