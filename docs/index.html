The streets where you can shop were quite full of people and terrace's were half  full with people having animated conversations, even tho it's only 2 degree celcius (35F) and misty outside. 

Colleagues are usually in for a chat in between work and two weeks ago in the train I had a 20 minute friendly conversation with another woman that I'd never met before. 

People do use their phones quite a lot here, but no social contact at all anymore doesn't seem the case. Now granted, I am someone who easily puts away my phone and look at people and start a conversation if I think someone might be up for it, so I make my own contact. 

Maybe that's what's going wrong as well. Everyone waiting for someone else to engage first while looking at their screen?</div>

What many people, even major Google fans, may not know, is that the original founders purchased a farm after selling the company. The weird part? Since introducing AI into the farm's workflow, their cattle have been grazing on some new type of grass. Apparently, the steaks have never been higher.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Google is just so well positioned to reap the rewards from AI.   Really they have been building the company for this from pretty much the start.

There is no company that has anywhere near the reach that Google enjoys.

Take cars. Google now has the largest car maker in the world, VW, GM, Ford, Honda a bunch of others ones now using Android Automotive as their vehicle OS. Do not confuse this with Android Auto. Google will just put Astra in all these cars. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero access to automobiles.

Same story with TVs. Google has Hisense, TCL, Samsung and a bunch of other TV manufactures using Google TV as their TV OS. Google will have all these TVs get Astra. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero on TVs.

Then there is phones. The most popular OS in the world is Android. Google has over 3 billion active devices running Android and they will offer Astra on all of these phones. Compare this to OpenAI that does not even have a phone operating system.

Then there is Chrome. The most popular browser. Compare this to OpenAI that does not have a browser. Google will be offering Astra built into Chrome.

But that is really only half the story. The other is Google has the most popular applications people use and those will be fully integrated into Astra.

So you are driving and Astra will realize you are close to being out of gas and will tap into Google Maps to give you the gas station ad right at the moment you most need it. Google will also integrate all their other popular apps like Photos, YouTube, Gmail, etc.

Even new things like the new Samsung Glasses are coming with Google Gemini/Astra built in.

There just was never really a chance for OpenAI. Google has basically built the company for all of this and done the investment to win the space.

The big question is what Apple will ultimately do? They are just not built to provide this technology themselves.

I believe that Apple at some point will just do a deal with Google where they share in the revenue generated by Astra/Gemini from iOS devices. Same thing they are doing with the car makers and TV makers.

They will need to because of how many popular applications Google has.

Astra will also be insanely profitable for Google. There is so many more revenue generation opportunities with an Agent than there is with just search.

BTW, it will also be incredibly sticky. Once your agent knows you there is little chance you are going to switch to a different one. This is why first mover is so important with the agent and why Google is making sure they are out in front with this technology.

Plus the agent is going to know you far better than anything there is today so the ads will also be a lot more valuable for Google.

The other thing that Google did that helps assure the win is spending the billions on the TPUs starting over a decade ago. Google is not stuck paying the massive Nvidia tax that OpenAI is stuck paying. Plus Google does not have to wait in the Nvidia line.

That is how Google can offer things like Veo2 for free versus OpenAI Sora

Or how Google is able to offer Gemini Flash 2.0 for free. But this is a very common MO for Google. They offer this stuff for free and suck out all the money and hurt investment into competitors. Then once the competition is gone Google will bump up the ads and/or subscription price. Plus the fact that people are not going to want to switch Agents it will also allow Google to bump up the ads without losing material customers.</div>

Good or bad, he is a visionary, back in 2016 [he said this](https://blog.google/products/assistant/personal-google-just-you/) and he was spot on:

&gt;"In the next 10 years, we will shift to a world that is AI-first, a world where computing becomes universally available — be it at home, at work, in the car, or on the go — and interacting with all of these surfaces becomes much more natural and intuitive"

I used to buy 12 packs of energy drinks from Amazon. They would sometimes get damaged to the point of not being able to be delivered. So the delivery status would change to Non Deliverable.

Multiple times, even after having to request a refund, I would realize a few weeks later that I never got my money back. I would have to open a chat with customer service to actually get my money back. 

Amazon is just shady like that. The last time it happened was finally the catalyst I needed to quit my daily energy drink addiction. So at least some good came of it.</div>

Even when you cancel your prime - if you have a payment method saved - they have charged me and re-enabled Prime without consent.

It was super suspicious so I took screenshots before reaching out. 

Even going to the area to show subscriptions enabled it just said that I was able to sign up and haven't had any active subscriptions.

Lo(thanks oxfozyne ^_^) and behold when I reached out, they denied and said it showed it was subscribed. I sent them screenshots showing otherwise. Funny enough. They asked me to check again after they refreshed on their side, weirdly enough it showed up as an active subscription since a certain date. 

Weirdly, no record of charges for the dates showing. 
They proceeded to refund.

Moral of the story - keep an eye on their charges because they're known to commit fraud without admitting even with evidence.</div>

Google is guilty of reenacting charges as well.
I got charged for YouTube TV a couple years ago, 6 months after I cancelled the trial..they restarted it &amp; charged me for 2 months and I was unaware of it until the last 2 days and they wouldn't refund a dime! Over $125!</div>

I guess because they've been convinced that the elite is some gay guy on social media and not the billionaires that are going to make us fight each other for scraps.</div>

If this doesn't tell everyone, you need to work for yourself in this landscape I don't know what will, but not everyone can work for themselves, what are people going to do ? create enclaves, produce products in groups of 3 - 4 highly skillset workers? with a factory of 3D printers, a weird enmeshment of content creator, mixed with softer engineers and a few textile experts?

Because its going that way, but as of now thats the extreme, but honestly, working to just work is broaching on insanity especially if the yield isn't insanely high.  Sure, plenty will do it to remain competitive, but everyone? when do we wake up.

Some of us can endlessly run on treadmills and be underhanded and competitive (cluster b types, and so on) but there are many who will just want to live a peaceful life, and do a reasonable amount, a required amount).  I feel like we're letting the gears go into overdrive and we're not saying "but most of us are just human."

Very dangerous I feel.  Like to what end, do we draw a line? place a humans value in society.  Everyones got to be at the top of their game at all times.  It just doesn't compute.  Unless your not human in the mind.  So now we forgo our humanity? do those just split off lol its crazy to envision.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think there is a massive asterisk here. First off, I would argue that DeepSeek’s low inference cost has less to do with technical innovation and more to do with financing. It’s impressive to get such performance out of 685b parameters, but the cost to compute on such a platform can be estimated, even from the outside, and is above what they are offering it for. With high certainty, we can say the inference costs being offered to us are subsidized. 

Now, these companies (ie DeepSeek, Alibaba, etc), certainly have other sources of fund raising (especially Alibaba), but it is worth noting that the CCP has identified artificial intelligence as a major strategic interest. These companies are certainly being obstructed by import bans on advanced chipsets (it’s arguable how easily that obstruction is to overcome in practice), but it would not be surprising to me if they were also being massively supported by their local government in ways more direct and robust than the U.S. government supports OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic, etc. 

I think you are mistaken to believe that the chip import ban is making Chinese engineers more creative than they otherwise would be. The corollary is to say that if Chinese engineers had easier access to H100s they would be lazier and make fewer advances, simultaneously American engineers are made lazy and ambivalent to innovation due to access to H100s. This is absurd. 

These sort of retrospective stories about the Russians and writing code on paper feel good. They make us believe that hardship makes us stronger. In reality, it’s a form of survivor bias. Those who are strong survived and became a larger relative fraction of the observable representation. Those who could have succeeded had the hardship not existed are never heard from. As a result, all the Russian programmers on Wall Street seemed really strong. 

The fact that you are falling victim to the survivor bias is evidence that hardship is hard. Well crafted obstructions (and I have plenty of thoughts about how our current ban could be better constructed) obstruct. In all likelihood, the U.S. chip ban likely is slowing down and suffocating many Chinese AI advances that otherwise would have proliferated, but you only see the strongest. An argument *could be made* that by weeding out the weaker competitors, the United States inadvertently concentrates the best Chinese engineers and CCP capital to a smaller number of successful giants, but that is hard to prove and if you have any belief in a free market economy you’d suspect America will have the same concentration, but simultaneously get more shots on goal.  

TL;DR No, the U.S. is not accelerating Chinese innovation. You are observing the results of survivor bias enhanced by direct government support.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">OP never mentioned lazy. You interpreted it as lazy, and completely missed the point.

One of the points is about doing more with less.

In the west, cost of hardware is relatively cheap, that you can have as much RAM and disk size as you want, even for retail consumers. As such, when you do development, such as games, you often don’t care for good memory allocation and efficient coding, in favor of speed and aesthetics. 

This often translates to wholly inefficient products that are bloated in size, and riddled with bugs.

In the 80s and 90s when things were more constrained, developers were much more creative, because they had to be creative.

As such, one of the points of the chip restriction is it forces countries like China to do more with less, to be more creative and efficient, just like the Russian programmers. And ironically, we will inevitably want to steal those ideas, and come full circle.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">While there are some kernels od truth in your argument, there are other factors that you ignore.

For one, in countries like China or the former USSR, general economic conditions are much worse compared to the US. At the same time, they also have much wider access to decent education, chruning a larger number of highly qualified scientists and engineers. Basically, in such societies, anyone who has the intellectual or whatever abilities will almost automatically get all the way to university and even post grad regardless of their family's economic conditions.

Both of those factors conspire to conspire to make an abundance of human capital for the few options that are sanctioned by the political system. Colloquially, human capital is much cheaper there compared to the west. It's not so much that US engineers are lazier, it's that it's cheaper to throe extra H100s at the problem to get to the market sooner, needing less human capital.

A Meta or Google or whoever have so many other projects worth Billions of annual revenue that they need highly skilled engineers for, and there are so many of those companies competing for the same pool of talent.

For another, having grown in a country and a time where access to computers was quote limited, and the access we had was mostly generations behind, I saw firsthand how this forced almost everyone to get very creative in pushing the resources we had to the limit. I wrote code with pen and paper despite having a decent machine at home, because that's how our coding exams happened and were graded. Literally everyone in all the computer science departments in the country in my generation had to do the same. We not only had to write code that would compile and execute, it had to be efficient. Our professors were used to reading code on paper and grading it for both correctness and efficiency. It was just the way things were.

It's almost a quarter of a century since the time I had to write code on paper, yet I still make use of that skill. I can still "write" a few pages worth of code in my head and debug it faster than anyone I've worked with can type said code. It's literally coding at the speed of thought. And no, I was nowhere near the top of my class, and most of those who were with my in uni at that time now have great careers in Europe and the US.</div>

With high certainty, we can say the inference costs being offered to us are subsidized. 

Can you show the math?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think human ingenuity finds a way. Throwing billions of VC cash at compute means you are busy solving other issues. I would say Deepseek has probably accelerated research around the world. Their success and their willingness to not only share their model weights, but meaningful insight into their methodology has opened the door for other, smaller ventures everywhere.

Instead of everyone lining up trying to give their funding to a few big players, I think we might see more cash going to smaller startups. More competition. More ideas. More progress.

The down side to me is that it's yet another blow to our ability to control the outcome. Lowering the barrier to entry means its easier to do this sort of thing covertly.  Using less energy, fewer and older GPUS means its going to be harder to track.</div>

Ironically I see this over and over.  AI doomers are resigned to realize the UN won't be any help, the US Federal government won't be helpful, the government of California won't help, and even the nonprofit board of openAI is in the process of quickly disbanding itself in favor of a standard corporate model with no checks whatsoever.  (Normally a board of directors actually has 1 job : to prevent the CEO from robbing investors, and to ensure the CEO is making an honest effort to enrich the company further. Thats it. )


So if human institutions can't be trusted....why are "we" any more trustworthy?  Exactly.

Eh, Businesses are getting a little nervous after have been bitten by the dragon. Every nation state seeks to control something in their own way.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/Better_Than_Free123:

---

**Nuremberg UFO Sighting (1561)**   
Explanation: The official explanation was a mass hallucination or meteorological phenomena (like sun dogs or ball lightning), with some suggesting meteors or weather balloons.

**Basel UFO Sighting (1566)**   
Explanation: Similar to Nuremberg, the explanation was atmospheric phenomena or cometary activity—possibly meteors or fireballs.

**1566 Air Battle of Stralsund**  
Explanation: Likely meteorological phenomena or optical illusions caused by light refraction, misinterpreted as a battle in the sky.

**1897 Great Airship Mystery**   
Explanation: Officially attributed to hot air balloons, blimps, or military test craft—or even mass hysteria. No evidence of extraterrestrial craft.

**1952 Washington D.C. UFO Incident**   
Explanation: Initially attributed to temperature inversions, later military aircraft misidentifications. No proof of extraterrestrial involvement.

**1965 Westall UFO Sighting**   
Explanation: No clear explanation. Some suggested experimental aircraft or weather balloons, though witnesses rejected these theories.

**1997 Phoenix Lights**   
Explanation: The U.S. Air Force said the lights were military flares, but many witnesses and researchers dispute this, as it doesn’t explain the V-shaped formation or the solid craft.

**2004 Mexican Air Force UFO Sighting**   
Explanation: The Mexican military released infrared footage, but no official explanation was provided. Speculation includes weather balloons or birds, though these don’t explain the high-speed movements.

**2006 O'Hare International Airport UFO Sighting**   
Explanation: The FAA suggested it might have been an ice crystal or weather phenomenon, though no definitive evidence was provided, and witnesses still believe it was a UFO.

And yet, we're still expected to believe that all this is prosaically explicable?

Let's cut the bullshit, it's time for disclosure.

                        <div class="comment-body">So it's kind of obvious that we are dealing with something that lives on this planet too considering how far back these sightings go. At this point, if they have lived here for hundreds of years they probably aren't just observing us. How far fetched is it to think there might be an advanced species sharing this planet with us that is either subterranean or aquatic? My guess is the latter since they continuously come out of the ocean.</div>

Why have they been so intent on keeping humans--generally--unaware of their existence? Their technology protects them from any threat we pose and makes the entirety of the planet theirs for the taking, if they want it.

If an advanced civilization called the oceans home, I don't think they would tolerate what we've been doing to the oceans. I don't think a long-term presence suggests this is their species' home.</div>

Yes, there are many weird sighting as of late but also many obviously man made objects that people would probably be able to distinguish if it wasn’t for all the buzz about these unknown objects.</div>

A great story well documented if you ever fancy looking it up, they blamed it on mass hysteria. It’s just bizarre to me that it could ever cause mass amounts of people to dance themselves to death</div>

Go 15 minutes without picking it up. Then once you can handle 15 minutes and you’ve done this for a few days. Increase it to 30 minutes. Then 1 hour. So on and so forth. After doing this for weeks on end. You’ll see the desire and need for your phone begin to fade. If you try to cut yourself cold turkey, you’ll only worsen the problem. Hence why diets and quitting anything cold turkey is often less effective.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey!

Phone addiction is similar to alcohol or drugs, in the sense that it numbs all your feelings and senses so you don’t need to face reality and avoid it.

Could it be perhaps something going on in your life that you’re not happy about and causes you anxiety?

For example your appearance, relationships, grades, recent breakup, etc?

For me, when I used to reach my phone was when I felt overwhelmed. If I had to do a lot of big things I would get paralysed and just be on my phone since it would distract me from the daunting task.

Also, the way dopamine works, if you wake up in the morning and first thing you do is checking the phone it will be almost impossible to do anything productive afterwards.

What has worked wonders for me was to replace to alarm by a digital clock, put the phone far away in a drawer and go on a 15m walk after I wake up, without phone, music or distractions.

Once you achieve your first victory of the day which is waking up, not using phone, go on a walk without dopamine you will see how much better you feel once you come back home and will keep stacking wins, brushing your teeth, going your bed, etc.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think the screen time limits are more likely to work if you can find fun things to do instead of using your phone. Try out different hobbies until you find some you’re really passionate about, and you might not even need the limits anymore. You also have to figure out exactly what need your phone is fulfilling for you and replace that need with something healthier. For me, I need the mental stimulation and I’ve been able to replace a lot of screen time with books pretty successfully. Maybe if you’re using your phone to calm anxiety, for example, you need to find some better way to do that, like journaling or exercising.</div>

1. Stop eating after night teeth brushing 
2. After each cup of tea or coffee, meditate for 5 minutes.
3. Drink 200 ml of water after each meeting.
4. Upon plugging in my phone for charging at night, decide three top priorities on my task list for tomorrow.
5. Reading 10 minutes while drinking morning coffee.
6. Journaling while watching TV.
7. Listen to audiobooks while driving kids  to school

P.S. Stacking more than two consecutive habits never worked for me; I tried it, but I always stick to two, i.e. I can never do x, y, and z on the same stack. I don't know why</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">my mom bought me a 'build your own sock monkey kit' for Christmas when i was 13.  I started it.  One night i saw it just sitting there with the bottom open where cotton was stuffed into it. 

I fucked it.  Then in a fit of remorse and guilt, buried it in the back yard at night. 

Years later my dog dug it up and brought it inside.  My mom has questions but I had no answers, only silence.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm imagining a young lad out in the yard, middle of the night with a thunderstorm raging around.

Face soaked with rain and tears... The sound of the shovel scraping the muddy earth between the thunder claps... You drop the husk of your sock monkey, a once dear friend given to you by your mother, into the shallow grave. 

You look down, agonizing over every decision that lead you here, silently praying to God to show you another way... 

Right as you start to cover sock monkey, a blazing flash of lightning illuminates him sending paralyzing dread through your soul...

                                <div class="reply-body">Two questions:

1) Did you bury it that night or did you have to live with the corpse of the sock monkey you raped for several days before you had the opportunity to get rid of the evidence?

2) Did it come to life?  Because this really sounds like the origin story of a horror movie plot.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">My first job at 18 was as a phone sex operator. 

This was in the late 90’s. I had a headset and everything. It was all done by phone, online chat hadn’t become an industry widely used platform yet. We had male employees too. They kept track of our average call times. I usually made the top of the list. A life achievement I proudly carry with me to this day. 

Lot of weird stories from that time. 

Also, if you’ve ever gotten a tarot reading from a hotline psychic, good chance you’re speaking to a phone sex operator who got promoted to what we called “the other side” which was literally the other side of the call centre.</div>

It's a very good offbeat movie.  If you haven't seen it you might really enjoy it based on that employment history.</div>
