                                <div class="reply-body">The executive branch and Doge using the the executive branch have repeatedly violated laws and the constitution. 

Court orders have been completely disregarded. The executive branch has taken powers from the legislative branch. The executive branch has stated and (iirc) signed an EO that says the executive branch is who determines what a law means. The executive branch has paid a foreign country to commit human rights violations on asylum seekers. Doge illegally and by force took over the US International Peace agency. And the list goes on. 

I really wish people would read things like The Jungle, read about the DuPont case in WV, PG&amp;E, or about the river fires (yes rivers that caught on fire) in the 50/60s.  

There is a reason it is REALLY bad that agencies like the EPA are being stripped of their ability to do their job. There is a reason legal experts were so concerned about Chevron being turned over. Then I want you to read about Putin, Mussolini, Hitler, Mao, and other dictators and their rise to power. 

The US is in a really bad spot right now. For a group of people that claim to read between the lines and to be so perceptive y'all are missing a lot.</div>

And they suck at doing even that!

They’ve wasted so much more money than they have ever saved because most of the moves have been subsequently blocked/reversed. There are now thousands of federal works doing **nothing** while on paid administration leave thanks to DOGE.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Been extensively testing this model today - it first appeared a couple of days ago. In my experience it is very capable and a big leap over all of Google's previous models, almost always matching Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking/o1/o3 mini and often exceeding their performances, especially on maths related tasks. Some of the tests I've run:

It's very creative and really just seems to *understand* what it's saying and formats it's response in the way that introduces the premise from the ground up, like what I've seen with 4.5, this is a really good model and this might be the best I've seen on lmarena yet</div>

I've been spending 14 hours a day for the past 6 days doing nothing but reasoning with models about our response to the defendants' brief in our legal case.  A key tell with these models is when you ask them how strong the defendants' case is.

When given all the motions and some relevant evidence, Claude 3.7 Sonnet and o1 (not pro) often rate the defendants' arguments as "strong."  Gemini, with the same prompt, rates them as "weak."  My assessment was in line with Gemini but I was wondering if I had missed something Claude was seeing.

But I think it turns out that Gemini just seems to be able to reason over its entire context window better.  The other models don't seem to "forget" - they just seem to deprioritize critical evidence.  When reminded, "look at the chatlogs," they then say "oh, yeah, I see what you mean."  But since the whole point is asking the models to look at what you're not seeing, that doesn't work in the long term.

All of the models say the defendants' case is "strong" when you I present their brief without showing the evidence, confirming that the intelligence is about the context window.

The "reasoning" benchmarks seem to be performed on useless riddles and small prompts, so you don't see how insane Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental 0205 is in benchmarks.  Claude 3.7 Sonnet is stuck in Pokémon land because it doesn't know what information in its context window is important.  Gemini's understanding of its context window - even back to the 1.5 days - has been its superior asset.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of these theories making the rounds... that the UFOs aren’t coming from deep space at all, but from right here, beneath us… the oceans.


And honestly, it makes sense. The logistics of staging an alien invasion from space would be impossible to pull off... too expensive, too hard to hide. But from the depths of the ocean? Much more believable, much easier to control.


Of course, the real twist is it’s all man-made... a carefully crafted illusion designed to stoke fear and tighten control. Just another chapter in the same old playbook.</div>

It seems like he's providing more information each time he sits down for interviews... as if he knows he doesn't have a whole lot of time to reveal what he truly knows to be fact. Just my opinion anyway.</div>

You guys must be thinking why only 10days. Because i don’t know if i can do it for more than 10 days😅. Lets start with small number.

It has already passed 2hrs and again and again i am searching for youtube in my phone’s search bar😂.

If i will pass the 10 days challenge. I will come again and tell you how it feels.

I'd hit the gym five days straight, then miss one workout and suddenly, I wouldn’t go back for two weeks. Same with reading, writing, or any other habit. One missed day turned into a full-on slump way too easily.

Then I found the 2-Day Rule, and it changed everything.

The rule is simple: never skip two days in a row.

If I miss a workout today, I have to go tomorrow.

If I don’t write today, I make sure to get words down...</div>

You also were originally on the ChatGPT board, and your posts appear formatted similarly, and are filled with rehashed advice and read inauthentically and polished. 

I’m genuinely interested - what are you getting out of posting advice which is clearly machine generated, and offers no actual insight from your own, true life and perspective? 

This is not an attack, I’m honestly fascinated by this approach that people are now having to posting on reddit self-improvement boards. Like, what is the end goal with this stuff?</div>

During covid the government in my country gave people access to their super if they needed it due to the emergency or being unable to work etc. The number of dumb motherfuckers I knew that didn't need the money at all but drained almost all their super to buy a new car and get a new gaming PC etc was insane.</div>

No, look, I agree with Keanu to a certain extent and who doesn’t love the guy. He’s probably right tbh. But it is an argument for apathy, isn’t it? That can’t really help anyone, except helping yourself stay out of trouble. And if you’re a multimillionaire, then yeah, you can get by pretty comfortably just staying out of trouble.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You mention you have two phones, that's perfect for triangulation. It doesn't matter if it's blurry or whatever to confirm anomalous movements.

Just have both phones record the thing (do you have tripods or some way of making them stay relatively still?) at the same time and note down details such as location, time, date, direction and  upload it. 

The data can be analyzed in Sitrec then for example.</div>

There is a speed improvment at higher usage rates but i don't know if that is a radical enough of a diffrence to make it worth it.

                        <div class="comment-body">I remember the company I worked for working on magnetic 'bubble' memory at the end of the 70s. Little magnetic bubbles that circulated on a long train, IIRC. They wanted to use it for non-volatile program memory on their telephone systems, so they could update the software as new versions became available. At the time, EEPROMs were superexpensive and UVPROMS were difficult to work with. But ultimately, it was dropped because non-volatile semiconductor RAM became cheaper and faster.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This isn’t that hard to make. I worked at Lindamood Bell for a while in reading intervention years ago while getting my undergrad, the hardest thing to scale is assessment and calibration of providing material that wasn’t too hard but not too easy. Fucking around with chat GPT, I was able to get it to take a text, have a student answer comprehension questions to find a baseline to their reading level, then generate new text to where the reader would be able to get about 70-80% comprehension. It would ask new questions, loop and loop and loop. Obviously not perfect, it would need a lot of tuning, but it could really help a lot of kids who fall behind and never catch up.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If I had to guess, this is because the use of AI enables students to answer as many "dumb" questions as they want. It's very common for people to refrain from asking questions out of fear of looking "dumb" for not getting it. Especially if you ask and you still don't get it, you don't want to keep asking more questions.</div>

I used ChatGPT a lot to help me out during an econ class I took last fall as a non econ major who hadn't taken an econ class in 2.5 years. The math aspect isn't great, and I'd double check everything, but it was a huge help in understanding the material/refreshing my memory, especially since I had other classes or work when the prof and TA had office hours.</div>
