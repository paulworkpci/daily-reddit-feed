He'll make cuts to programs designed to help people but look the other way when the DoD is set to receive their next 900 billion for the fiscal year.

Edit: Oh, I'm sorry. It's a paltry 850 billion slated for 2025. To put this in perspective, China, who is undoubtedly our closest potential rival, spent 296 billion in 2024.</div>

My instagram stopped showing my all the cool amazing stuff I was into from years ago, and Im kind of happy for it. 
I follow almost 5000 accounts and only get shown like 20.

Now its all reels, had a great night of laughter a couple nights ago scrolling.

But still the way I perceive the world feels fundamentally different. Completely brain rotted.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I used to be in the same boat as you. I had severe brain rot and had a hard time doing stuff other than social media. I specifically wanted to read books instead of social media. So I started to read more and do social media less, and I did it little by little. There is hope. It is like a muscle, and the more you use it the more you will be able to be stronger and get your attention span back. You can do this.</div>

One of the challenges is that we're in a quick-fix, instant gratification society. So a lot of people struggling expect that a few changes will result in the desired outcome fast. And when they don't get the change, they struggle even more. Digging deeper into the hole.</div>

Even if openai didn't exist and bard was the frontier model, i do not expect Google to make Bard's entry into the market as a free to use tool and an API so easily accessible for anyone. Not painting Google to be the bad person here, but Google would need to go through tons of legal hurdles and social drama to even make an attempt. It would have been deeply integrated into google products without the user even realising that it's using AI tech, something like smarter auto complete in gmail or smarter editing in google photos.</div>

Here are some that have helped me:

-If I sit down to watch TV, I drink a glass of water first.

-Every time I pick up a snack, I also grab a piece of fruit.

-If I go to the toilet after dinner, I brush my teeth immediately after.

                                <div class="reply-body">Note: this is considered a routine vs a schedule. 

A routine is a series of events, and a schedule is time based. 

Adhd has a broken reward pathway in your brain that makes routine and habit building more difficult. Also a broken internal clock that makes time management (part of executive function) dysfunctional and can make schedules a struggle. Therefore, if you want to bed more successful at routine building, you should combine activities that make sense  or set up your environment to help build routines. For example, if you want to drink water when you watch tv, keep your remote in your kitchen or put a mini fridge next to your couch with reusable water bottles filled. 

Things like brushing teeth you might find it easier to keep a toothbrush by every sink in the house and in the shower so it's easy for you to do whenever you think about it, routine or schedule be damned.


It is also a big recommendation if you have children to focus on the routine and not the schedule, that way you can be flexible with time a little and it's the routine that helps the kid know what to expect and transition from activity to activity.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think the thing is, AI will arguably make the part of life that sucks even worse.  We all live close together, but we're all isolated.   I'd argue most people aren't on anti-depressents because there's just this epidemic of brains with chemistry problems... people are using them to flatten the downs coming from a modern world that takes away real freedom, and replaces it with fake freedom.  That makes it easy to buy something, but really hard to form real human connections.

The world was pretty bad pre-covid, but post-covid it's just become devoid of human contact, and I think people crave that.  Not in a "here's your coffee" service oriented way.  Something more than that.  We're still tribal monkeys who just want to go hunting with our bros at the end of the day.  Video games kind of give you that, but it's fake connection in the same way porn is fake connection.</div>

There are some of us who have kids who might want them to inherit possibilities that are something beyond "Work for 30 years, most likely in a career that you don't enjoy, while trying to outcompete your peers globally."  You don't have to be depressed to want humanity to move beyond our status quo.</div>

No but seriously this will eventually become a massive market so it’s not surprising.

Not saying this isn’t troubling, but tech companies have been doing the non-AI equivalent of this in China for at least a decade- prolly longer.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Why are we surprised? All models developed in the US have a strong Western bias. Try asking for specifics or recommendations on Chinese literature, Thai philosophy, Malian history, or how gender is perceived in Polynesia. The responses will likely be approximate and, at best, reflect a Western perspective approaching those themes through *Western* anthropology.  

The fault lies not only in the limited data available for some regions but also in the fact that we naturally embed our culture and values into our language and then into the way we build models.  

There’s a HUGE debate about biases and issues like racism and sexism in LLMs, but we are only beginning to pay attention to cultural sensitivity and how to better represent humanity, not just the worldview of the typical 20-30-year-old, cisgender, upper-class, white Californian engineer.</div>

Went cold turkey because I kept hearing things like, “Your energy levels will improve,” and “You’ll feel less anxious,” and so on. All these promises.

Guess what? Nothing changed. I was just constantly tired, stuck at an energy level of like 3 or 4 out of 10 the whole time.

So I decided to start drinking coffee again a couple days ago, and wow! Instant improveme...</div>

Personally, even though I only drink 1 cup a day, skipping just one day gives me a headache like clockwork. So I prefer to let myself keep it as a daily habit, but just limit the intake amount.

Try to be strict with it! I generally treat 2 cups as my absolute upper limit, for days when I'm really exhausted for some reason.</div>

Google don't have the same profit incentive that OpenAI do, Google can keep on printing money from their advertising business and burn billions on this a year forever. Same as Meta being able to burn money on AI and VR until it works because they just print money. AI is OpenAI's entire revenue generator, this has to work and take off for them sooner rather than later because they're burning through cash and have no way to make it back outside of funding rounds.</div>

"I've been saying this within DeepMind for at least 10 years, with the additional clarification that it's about cognitive problems that regular people can do.  By this criteria we're not there yet, but I think we might get there in the coming years."

  
**François Chollet Post:**

"Pragmatically, we can say that AGI is reached when it's no longer easy to come up with problems that regular people can solve (with no prior training) and that are infeasible for AI models. Right now it's still easy to come up with such problems, so we don't have AGI."</div>

This isn't something that we'll have to wait until 2100 to see. It's coming because all the incentives are in place. Multiple engineering challenges have been overcome. There are still some major hurdles, but they're far from insurmountable.

Making AGI isn't like trying to go faster than light. It's primarily a hardware/software problem. General intelligence is possible. Every human is proof of that. Making it in a machine is just engineering and refinement. And whoever achieves it first will likely reap incalculable rewards.</div>
