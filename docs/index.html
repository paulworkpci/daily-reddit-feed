                                <div class="reply-body">Back in 2017 or so I actually managed to get enough comment karma or whatever to post an answer to a question there. Felt like a major accomplishment at the time, because Stack Overflow did not have the real answer but it was hard to post one and mods claimed it was solved. It drives me crazy how often you look up a topic and some moderator has responded "Closed as already answered" and yet it's not answered.

Wikipedia used to be similar with the overzealous moderation. I had multiple articles removed wayyy back in the day (like 2005-2006) by the power moderators as "redundant" and pointless and now there are gigantic articles about the topic... and Mr. Power Moderator gets to take the credit for writing them. We're talking topics like "Barred Spiral Galaxy" and stuff like that, and I went through and added photos from astronomy papers and everything. Wikipedia super-users quite literally stole authorship from authors and young scientists for years, and then put the credit on their own resumes.

I love free resources like Wikipedia, but it's why I'm immediately skeptical of people celebrated for "decades of contributions." It's easy to be a huge contributor if you block out everyone else  and take credit for yourself.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The problem with Stack Overflow has always been that they gave moderation powers to those who are good at answering questions (i.e. those that got points). Unfortunately, but to no ones surprise really, the skills to be good at answering technical questions (an eye for detail; being nitpicky etc.) have zero overlap with those which make a good moderator. I'd even go so far and say that often people who are good at answering technical questions are the *worst* moderators.


For a while people still were willing to suffer the abuse of the petty tyrants, but this lead to death spiral where less people were willing to put up with this, which means less questions got answered, which made the site less useful and so on.

In a way it's the same with Wikipedia, which also suffers from a lack of people willing to put up with petty tyrants reverting every edit and forcing you to fight weeks to month of discussions through. And then they wonder why they have less and less people making edits.</div>

"Ok, I need to pretty much ask for forgiveness for not knowing this thing, show that I tried to do my research, cover what I do know to show I'm not an absolute idiot, but don't make it over 2 paragraphs because these days everything that takes more than 2 minute to read is now a wall-of-text, also apologize that I'm just looking for entry-level equipment to do x and don't want to spend $3000 to start with... " 

Then make sure I read the FAQ and rules, 1 hour later finally find the moral fortitude to post. Get one bot answer, 2 troll answers saying I'm poor af and not serious, then someone answering without having read my question. I'm going to miss this soooo much. I'm getting emotional thinking about these shared moments that will be lost in time, like tears in the rain.</div>

The common perspectives on this sub, whether or not they are right, tend to be so fucking LAZY. Just shouting "well the billionaires will just kill all of us" is the exact kind of low effort doomer perspective that shuts down discussion and, once again while it's not impossible, it's just so lazy. How? They are powerful for sure, but there are forces immeasurably more powerful than billionaires.

Regardless, what do I mean by reason out from today? Well -- AI is moving fast, we know this - it's probably not going to take twenty years to start automating a lot of jobs. 

My money is on a few years, personally. 

There are not going to be robot armies in just a few years. Even if you somehow doubled robot manufacturing throughput every six months (which is beyond insanely fast) it would still take 20-40 years from today to fully automate physical labor. 

So, chances are, we are going to see Computer-using agents explode in popularity LONG before robots do.

So no, not everyone is going to lose their jobs all at once. And what about the billionaires? Are they just going to let us all starve?

Maybe. It's not an impossibility, but it just seems silly to me. How could you possibly get from today to a future where 100-1000 humans could effectively close rank against eight BILLION humans with literally nothing to lose?

The economy isn't some ethereal thing that exists away from its workers. The silicon in the chips comes from an actual hole in the ground you can go to. The chips are built in factories somewhere. Electricity is made in power plants that you can visit! A global supply chain that is only partially automated would absolutely not be able to survive half the global population being told "k thanks we don't need you anymore good luck"

I'm not especially convinced a fully automated supply chain could survive the entire global population being turned loose either.

I'm just shouting at clouds at this point but I wish people put more thought into their doomsday scenarios. Try to reason how you arrive somewhere from this very exact day today - and, at least if you ask me, a lot of them sound a lot less reasonable after you chew on the idea long enough. There are plenty of negative outcomes, but "oops all genocide" is lazy and (while I understand the motivation) a reflection of the widespread pessimism of our time.</div>

It only takes a small % to cause enormous social unrest. The Great Depression of 1929 saw a 25% unemployment rate. More than 50% of our current jobs are white collar jobs, which are prime for being replaced by automation in the near future.

I’m not a doomer, I think the machine god will prevail and I hope for a utopia when it happens. But until then buckle the fuck up, shit is going to get weird.</div>

&gt;There are not going to be robot armies in just a few years. Even if you somehow doubled robot manufacturing throughput every six months (which is beyond insanely fast) it would still take 20-40 years from today to fully automate physical labor.

Because if we have companies that can produce 700-900k cars a month, then I wonder how you came up with an idea that producing something much less complicated wouldn't be possible? It looks like you assumed that the amounts of robots we produce right now are somehow limited due to lack of resources or tech. While it has nothing to do with that. When the demand arises there will be companies ready to boost their production not 2x each 6 months but perhaps hundreds of times in the first month.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Software can be copied nearly for free. Hardware scales a lot. Once AGI happens, you almost immediately jump from a few billion barely useful computers to a few billion new humans, at least. Or maybe a single entity with all that compute power, or something inbetween like individual copies that coordinate perfectly. AWS prices are like 0.05 cents per hour, compare that to minimum wage.

You are correct about elites not mattering at all. You are probably wrong about the rest of humanity mattering at all. A lot of the economy is set up to produce and transport material goods that aren't mining hardware, chips, cables and solar panels, and the new AGI supermajority doesn't need those parts. Supporting that kind of foodless shelterless disposable educationless (and so on) economy is easier, not harder - their doubling rates are faster, they're more efficient in terms of raw goods, etc., so even if their intelligence is precisely equal to ours we're not guaranteed to win a conflict. If they/it cares about us (an engineering problem), we're good.</div>

I just keep planting more seeds and now I’m taking cuttings from random plants I see. I go to the grocery store, look at the produce: “yeah, I bet I could grow that rutabaga”. Celery, put it in a bowl of water, get more celery. I can’t stop. I have like 40 eggplant plants. Dozens of tomato plants. I’ve overcrowded my greenhouse (tent) and now I have to find places to plant all these things in the ground.

                                <div class="reply-body">I was super excited about the matrix multiplication finding but apprehensive because a lot of AI hype is… hype.  Finally found the “proof” in Appendix A of their white paper (was this peer reviewed?).  Also, appendix B has all their bound improvements on other algorithms.  

The matrix multiplication in Appendix A.  AlphaEvolve did not find a new algorithm itself.  Instead, AlphaEvolve wrote the code that optimized for lower rank tensor decompositions used in matrix decompositions.  The rank of these tensor decompositions represents the number of scalar multiplications required.  So, instead, AlphaEvolve wrote a numerical optimization program that was used to find these lower rank decompositions.  Definitely something a person could do.

Now appendix B shows improvements on upper and lower bounds.  All these improvements are done through the same numerical optimization approach to A.  Most of these already discovered algorithms use step functions that AlphaEvolve optimized.

Looks like a lot of these mathematical improvements come from AlphaEvolve setting up an optimization workflow while specifying: learning rate, grad noise, drop out, and a loss function.  Which is still really cool!! But we’re not break P!=NP anytime soon and these are far from new algorithms.</div>

When they hung up I immediately became extremely anxious. I could feel the electricity flowing through my body. My mind was going 1000 miles a minute. I tried to distract myself by watching TV but I could feel it getting stronger and I could barely concentrate on the show.

That might not sound impressive, but this record had stood for FIFTY-SIX YEARS.

Let me put this in perspective:

* Matrix multiplication is literally one of the most fundamental operations in computing - it's used in everything from graphics rendering to neural networks to scientific simulations
* Strassen's...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Since the end of last summer I have gone from extremely skeptical on AI as a whole to now reading about Gemini inventing new math paradigms with recursive learning and freeing up 0.7% of Google’s global computing power. Seeing as how this equates to hundreds of millions of dollars in savings, I understand that I was wrong before.

FURTHER, these AlphaEvolve discoveries were made over a year ago, so who knows what Deepmind is working on now? Announcements like these def make me think we are on an exponential path towards AGI in the next several years.</div>

Except for all the dozens of improvements to it that have been discovered since then?  This is only true if you are concentrating specifically on the number of scalar multiplications for multiplying a small matrix and ignore improvements in the number of addition/subtraction operations as well as larger asymptotic complexity which has steadily improved over the last 60 years.

My Advice is keep your foot on the gas and keep learning/specializing or you will be replaced as some point in time. learn to integrate and how AI will fit into organizations. There will still need to be oversight as AI learns reasoning and negotiation.

Focus on AI tools or how to command AI. Learning the Data science behind it will help.  
I think mission critical systems will take longer to automate but they will be automated in the next 10 years if not sooner.

There will be consequences, I can't foresee all of them, but again to remain relevant in a changing future i would learn cross domain skills.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Seriously, cgpt has amped my coding productivity by leaps and bounds. People who end up wasting more time than coding directly are just not utilizing it properly.

Coding yourself *could* be faster if (1) you know the language you're coding in like the back of your hand because you've been using it exclusively for a decade and (2) nothing in the code involves doing anything new you haven't done before or aren't very familiar with. But if that's your standard operating state for coding I imagine it'll get really boring really quick.

A good trick to coding with cgpt reliably is generating unit tests *first* that you check yourself and verify the output will do what you want, then use those tests religiously during the coding process.</div>

Almost 100% of the time they'd be overjoyed to bring fresh donuts to their entire staff for that shift, and I'd get two large sandwiches for free.

We have to get donuts to trade for burgers

I don’t think this LPT will work universally. When in a mall or large shopping complex, the employees can trust each other. If someone randomly came into my store offering to trade, who knows what happened to that food.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Maybe. GM and Ford will have gen 2 versions of their trucks at some point and RAM might fall behind. Demand may grow as the market electrifies in general, that's (obviously) real hard to predict.

The Ramcharger also might be a hit like the 4xEs are, seeing as it may have no real downsides for the buyer and some neat advantages over an ICE-only or plugless hybrid truck (assuming it's reliable...). And it likely saves Stellantis some emissions credit money. The delay is likely gonna cost them I bet.</div>
