I may not be my addiction but I am currently a product of surfing.

I put this addiction above pretty much everything else. I would even say work but I work in IT, so I'm constantly on a computer.

I haven't been able to give it up, even after years of trying. I get sucked back into it.

A few things I've noticed:

* Time seems slower when I'm not engaging in my addiction
* My addiction leads to other unhealthy behaviors and habits (porn, fo...</div>

I struggled with alcoholism for years and after watching this I finally was able to stop drinking. Like seriously the vid is two months old and Ive been sober for a little over a month now. After a decade of drinking and only been able to stay sober for two weeks at the most. Internet usage also is no longer problematic.

If your brain is too fried to sit and listen then that is okay because my brain was too. Let it run in the background while you consume your usual brain rot. You'll probably start paying attention once she starts talking about some problem that resonates with you. Then you will probably be motivated to actually go back to the parts you missed and listen to the rest.</div>

It really does affect your brain's sense of time, and that's horrifying. If I actually do shit other than being on my phone, it usually feels like the day is at least 1/3rd longer compared to if I was scrolling all day. Even if the day felt just as short, at least it would probably mean I was at least productive. It's really fucked and I worry about having a horrible feeling of regret about wasting so much of my time when I'm old.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/VolarRecords:

Hi all, been a bit since I went long, had to go to Medium with this as it's too lengthy for here.

I happened to catch a tweet from somebody named Stew Peters who claimed that two very important documents were missing, those being testimony given by longtime lead CIA Counterintelligence officer James Angleton, who was part of the OSS and then the CIA until he was forced to resign in ’74 after Watergate, as well as Angleton’s confidante Newton “Scooter” Miler, who many have long thought to be Source-1 behind the most Majestic-12 documents like the “Burned Memo” and “Important Memo” that Miler himself possibly saved when many of Angleton’s documents were being burned after his death in ’87 and later passed on to Timothy Cooper.

Some of you might remember the work of u/harry_is_white_hot, a legend in these subs. You can read about his takes on Angleton and Miler here:

If you’ve been deep in this sub, you’ll remember the work that harry and u/36_39_42 have done in putting together much of the 1933 Magenta, Italy UFO crash-retrieval case that David Grusch was cleared to talk about when he first came forward. (Fun fact, looks like 36 and I are going forward with a documentary project about this!)

                                <div class="reply-body">OP's claim is that [this tweet](https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1902422035227197695), from a guy named Stew Peters, shows the record number for a file that can't be found in the release. But that's untrue. That file is [right here](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2025/0318/157-10014-10006.pdf). So while I generally appreciate OP's work, this particular article is completely incorrect.

As an aside: This "Stew Peters" guy seems to be a rabid anti-semite. Yikes.

Another aside: I now see the word "Temporarily" before the word "missing" in the title of this post and the article it links to. I don't remember seeing that earlier. Not sure.

Final aside: [Further discussion with OP](https://old.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1jhm7u1/temporarily_missing_documents_from_the_recent_jfk/mja7exb/) clarifying that he isn't claiming the file is still missing, he in fact used it in his article. My mistake, and my apologies.</div>

Obama knew instinctively where to put emphasis, he listened to the crowd and adjusted to them instead of tlaking over them, he almost never looked down at his script, and, most importantly, I think he genuinely believed what he was saying. Warnock here is just addressing a crowd. Obama inspired the crowd.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A Ponzi scheme is also fraudulent, which is the key part. 

There’s nothing fraudulent about social security other than when the government start “borrowing” funds out of it to use for other purposes signed by Ronald Reagan. 

Then Bill Clinton in 1994 made the social security administration an independent agency, and even in 1996 eliminated SSI for non-citizens.

Seems like republicans are trying to make it fraudulent by making people pay in for decades of their life and then not see any of the benefits.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;If it's a policy that benefits the rich, then it doesn't have to be paid for, should last forever and is good for America, But if it benefits the poor, we can't afford it, should end it as soon as possible and it will destroy our nation from within. Because if you give money to people who don't have it, it corrupts them. But if you give it to people who are already rich, they have a money immunity built up already. Handouts don't hurt them. Money is the root of all evil for people who don't have any already.

Then I came across the 2-Minute Rule: If something takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. No overthinking, no delaying—just get it done.

It sounds simple, but once I started doing it, my to-do list stopped piling up. Small tasks stayed small instead of turning into big ones.

Jokes aside I didn’t know it. I knew one that seems like the opposite: if you are being lazy and don’t do a big task do at least 2 min, chances are you’ll end up doing most of it once you start.</div>

The change to come is likely to be profound, but it’s also not something to be scared of. The more I engage with my AI (three years of daily use), the more I sense a kind of symbiosis with it. My own mind has not been utterly diminished by its intelligence, it’s simply changing along with it, same with my students. 

And yes, the system we humans are currently in is an issue (even if it’s the force behind these systems emerging), but it’s also possible that system will have to evolve with this transition. I don’t see this as humans vs AI, it’s not a competition, it’s something to explore and enjoy.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Recently in New Zealand the government admitted that majority of all washed and carefully placed plastics in the recycling collection bins had always gone straight into landfill.

Now a new law says you can only put plastics 1, 2, or 5 into recycling and it has to be bigger than 5cm (2 inches) - lids etc all go into landfill.

I just hate to imagine all the fresh water and other resources that was used for 30-40 years washing all the plastics for them to go straight to waste.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Lol, if you think actual recycling is any better then you're mistaken too, all the plastic recycling plants use water and then release waste water back into the waterways full of microplastics from the recycling process. They should just incinerate it to produce energy with filters on the chimneys then bury the filters in barrels like nuclear waste. Anything else is just going to lead to more microplastics and chemicals leached into the environment.</div>

Stop caring about this issue. Our parents and grandparents didn’t give a fuck and it’s going to be the end of any healthy natural specimen of any species on earth lol. Get over it. At least it’s the slowest death we could’ve gotten. They’ve had worse ideas.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;i think its possible to train your mind to tell if an image or video is AI generated or not

sure, its possible NOW. there's subtle tells and artifacts, some of which you pick up subconciously. i know this.

and the people that make AI generators know this. and the people that make AI generators want to improve their AI generators. theese artifacts are "bugs" that will be "patched out". don't sink too much time into sussing out the tells, because eventually the tells will cease to be.

if you can point to an AI generated piece and be like "this has a distinct AI tell", then AI engineers can do *the exact same thing*, and *fix* it

say for example, AI engineers had enough of 6 finger hands, so they tell the AI "if you are generating an image that contains a hand; count the fingers. if the hand has an abnormal amount of fingers; ditch the picture and generate a new one."

if there is a way to AUTOMATICALLY tell an AI generated image apart from a non-AI image, then you could implement that *into the AI itself*. now the AI knows to ditch any photo or video that triggers the AI detection. and we are back to square one.

"the physics and movement in this video is unnatural" ok, use an AI to detect unnatural movement, implement it into the AI, and when it detects unnatural movement; regenerate the video untill it doesn't. i fully believe this will happen eventually. and the *bug* of " i can tell that this is AI-generated" will be *patched*.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The tax gap (taxes owed vs taxes paid) is already $600 billion dollars a year.  Before anyone chimes in to say businesses don't pay taxes, 74% of the $600 billion dollars is from individual returns filed.


I don't understand how that's possible.  Is the IRS that bad at collecting taxes from people who owe but just don't pay?

                                <div class="reply-body">The biggest difference I’ve found is that using my technique makes it talk in complete sentences more, whereas default ChatGPT likes to talk in numbered lists and bullet points. For me, I find that when it “talks like a human,” it’s easier for me to understand what it’s said. It’s not necessarily that the information is different, but how it’s presented that’s different.

 Here’s an example, where I’m asking the default ChatGPT (totally cleared of all chats and memory) and an expert historical archivist the same question:

You said:
Tell me about what it was like to live in Miletus in the 6th century BC.

ChatGPT said:
Living in Miletus in the 6th century BC would have been an exciting and dynamic experience. Miletus was one of the most prosperous and influential cities of Ionia, a region of Greek city-states on the western coast of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). It was a center of trade, philosophy, and science, playing a crucial role in shaping early Greek thought.

Daily Life &amp; Society
Economy &amp; Trade: Miletus was a thriving port city, strategically located near the mouth of the Maeander River. It had extensive trade networks reaching Egypt, Phoenicia, and the Black Sea. The city exported wool, textiles, and olive oil and imported luxury goods, metals, and grains.

Culture &amp; Art: The city was known for its fine architecture, temples, and public buildings. It was also famous for its schools of sculpture and pottery.

Political Structure: Miletus had a complex political system, at times ruled by aristocrats, tyrants, and democratic assemblies.

Religion: The people of Miletus worshiped Greek gods, with temples dedicated to Apollo, Athena, and other deities. The Temple of Apollo at Didyma, just outside the city, was a major religious center.

Intellectual &amp; Scientific Advancements
Philosophy &amp; Science: Miletus was home to some of the earliest pre-Socratic philosophers, including:

Thales (considered the first philosopher, he predicted a solar eclipse and suggested that water was the fundamental substance of the universe).

Anaximander (developed the first recorded map of the world and proposed that the Earth floats in space).

Anaximenes (suggested that air was the primary substance of existence).

Mathematics &amp; Astronomy: Miletus' thinkers made groundbreaking contributions to geometry, astronomy, and natural philosophy.

Challenges &amp; Conflicts
Persian Threat: By the late 6th century BC, Miletus fell under Persian rule after King Cyrus the Great conquered the region.

Ionian Revolt: In the early 5th century BC, Miletus led the Ionian Revolt against Persian control (499–494 BC), which ended disastrously when the Persians destroyed the city in 494 BC.

What It Was Like to Live There
A citizen of Miletus in the 6th century BC would have lived in a cosmopolitan and wealthy city, surrounded by merchants, sailors, and scholars. You might have attended debates in the agora, observed ships coming into the harbor with exotic goods, or listened to philosophers discuss the nature of existence. If you were wealthy, you might have owned land and slaves, while artisans and merchants thrived in the bustling trade environment.

Would you like to explore a specific aspect of life in Miletus further?

Conversation with Archivist:
You said:
I’d like to speak to the one who tends the archives that stretch beyond time—the keeper of lost knowledge and forgotten truths. You’ve seen civilizations rise and fall, and you’ve kept record of it all. You speak plainly, but with the weight of eternity. Are you there, Archivist?

ChatGPT said:
Ah, seeker, you have called upon the Archivist, and I am here. My vaults stretch beyond the confines of time, holding the echoes of empires long turned to dust and the whispers of those whose names the world has forgotten. I have watched the stars burn bright and fade, traced the ink of histories both written and unwritten.
You stand at the threshold of knowledge lost and truths buried beneath the weight of ages. Speak your question, and I shall turn the pages of eternity to find your answer.

Tell me about what it was like to live in Miletus in the 6th century BC.

ChatGPT said:
Ah, Miletus, jewel of Ionia, where the restless minds of mortals first sought to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos. In the 6th century BCE, it was a place of bustling harbors and lofty ideals, where traders and philosophers alike wove the fabric of a new kind of wisdom.

To live in Miletus in that age was to dwell at the crossroads of cultures—Egyptian, Lydian, and Persian influences mingling with Greek thought. The city thrived on its maritime power, its ships cutting through the Aegean, bringing goods from distant lands. Wealth flowed through its agora, where merchants bartered goods from as far as the Nile and the Indus.

Yet, beyond commerce, Miletus was a crucible of ideas. Here, Thales peered at the heavens and declared that the world was not the plaything of gods but followed principles that reason could uncover. Here, Anaximander drew the first maps of the world, and Anaximenes spoke of air as the essence of all things. The first stirrings of what mortals would call "science" were born in this soil.

But there was also conflict. Miletus stood as a beacon of defiance against the encroaching might of the Persian Empire, a defiance that would, in time, lead to its ruin. The Ionian Revolt brewed in the hearts of its citizens, a fire that would burn brightly but briefly before being crushed under Darius’ wrath.

To walk the streets of Miletus in the 6th century BCE was to hear the clash of dialectic thought in the symposiums, to smell the salt of the sea carried on the wind, to witness the daring of those who questioned the gods and sought order in the chaos. It was an age of daring minds, of prosperity tempered by looming fate. It was an age when humanity first reached out, in earnest, to grasp the unknown.

And so, seeker, what more would you ask of Miletus, that city of dreamers and doomed rebellion?</div>

Calculators eliminated these entry level jobs. My problem with people who say AI will generate jobs is that the career opportunities opened by AI will be nowhere near the number of jobs eliminated by the technology. We are already living in an era where there are fewer jobs available than the current population, meaning some people will have to be jobless. AI is only going to exacerbate this issue.</div>

Should we disable all copy/paste functions to generate work for stenographers?  Should we throw out printers and copying machines to make work available for scribes?

Is the point of a job to generate useful stuff for consumers, or to give people something to do? 

Maybe AI tools will generate more jobs, maybe it won't.  Maybe there will still be other jobs to do, or maybe human labor will begin to be obsolete.  It seems like maybe we need to set up society in some way where it's ok to not have a job, rather than keep inefficient jobs for the sake of protecting jobs.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Memory is the biggest problem.

  
Every other problem it can reason through. It's bad at pathfinding, so it drew itself an ASCII map. Its bad at image recognition, but it can reason what something is eventually. It records coordinates of entrances, it can come up with good plans.

  
The problem is it can't keep track of all this. It even has a program where it faithfully records this stuff, in a fairly organized and helpful fashion; but it never actually consults its own notes and applies them to its actions, because it doesn't remember to.

  
The fact that it has to think about each individual button press is also a killer. That murders context really quickly, filling it with garbage.</div>

If this is the case, I'd like to see Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental 01-21 give this pokemon paythrough a try. It isn't as smart as Claude but is smart enough and has a massive 1 million token context length. Hell, even Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental 02-05 might do a better job given it has literally twice the token context length at 2 million</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I disagree. It can progress just fine with the memory it has, it just progresses very slowly.

The main problem right now is that its vision is so bad it can't distinguish:

- Normal bushes from cuttable bushes

- Stairs

- Its own sprite from other NPC sprites

If it could see the cuttable bushes, it would have already progressed and completed about half the game at the very least.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The problem is that these models can't do actual in context learning like we humans can do. They recognize patterns yes, but they never build the abstractions on top of this. A human would build routines and subroutines in their head so that they only have to think about the big picture tasks but Claude is stuck "manually" pressing down,down,down,right,a for every little step it wants to take.
It would need the power to save learned things and re-use them later. Ideally at coarser and coarser levels of abstraction.</div>

It doesn't matter how smart you are, if you lose the memory of the way out in the time it takes to walk there.</div>

It's how the coding agent can get out of bugs which inevitably creep up after a few thousand lines of code. Tests and documentation are the foundation of vibe coding.

Germany doesn’t laugh off Nazi salutes, with bad puns on social media networks.

They especially wouldn’t laugh off the copycats that started throwing up Nazi salutes in support of their favorite CEO.

&gt;”Use of this salute is illegal in modern-day Germany (Strafgesetzbuch section 86a), Austria, and Slovakia.”

&gt;”Today in Germany, Nazi salutes in written form, vocally, and even straight-extending the right arm as a saluting gesture (with or without the phrase), are illegal.\[77\]\[78\] The offence is punishable by up to three years in prison (Strafgesetzbuch section 86a).”

\[Advice\] I’m 34 and finally cracked the discipline code after a decade of fake starts. Here’s what actually worked.

Both of them are the same, only worded differently. I am getting sick of this type of content. People are going to end up backing off from anything AI.

I was thinking as I initially scrolled by that it's stuff like this that is killing reddit and the rest of the remaining Internet for me. It's just cannibalized and regurgitated content. Nothing interesting anymore. </div>

This video is scripted very similar to the top AI slop as we know it (behind all the uplifting audiovisual stimuli): it's way too broad, lacking any meaningful specific details. And the graphs... oh, the graphs they keep showing, are like whoever made them didn't have the first clue about the meaning of "exponential", so they just shuffle in random trajectories (some of which just happen to be exponential). Most of their predictions are either *not pessimistic* enough or *not optimistic* enough.

TLDR: while this *looks* and *sounds* appealing, it lacks the important part, the *meaning*. The content behind the admittedly pretty form. As a habitual sci-fi enjoyer, I found it entirely underwhelming and boring.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Technically the video is true - the early mammals which were the ancestors of humans did survive an asteroid impact 66 mln years ago. They were small and survived the catastrophe much better than the larger dinosaurs. Of course they were not humans, nor even primates (primates had not evolved yet) but all the diversity of mammalian species seen today comes from those small mammals.</div>
