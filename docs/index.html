Once im done with a clay project or gaming like I don’t have people to talk about it with. But if I do try disciplining long enough I can actually fix my dopamine possibly.

                        <div class="comment-body">You need to start small. Even if it's moving your phone to the other side of the room or place you stay in. Create obstacles in-between you and easy dopamine hits. Buy an alarm clock and sweat it out if you need your phone to wake you up. 

You sound like you are depressed and lack the drive to exist. I've been there and it does feel like there's no way out but there always is because you had to use an entrance to get to where you are now. 

Start thinking of who you are even a little bit close to, reach out to them even if it means you get rejected. There is nothing more exhilarating than sending a message that is very significant. Most people want to help and if the people you reach out to don't want to help or find your current situation embarrassing, they aren't worth your time. 

The interests you still have, use reddit to interact with people that share the same interests, seeing people like yourself make stuff always inspires me. Use the resources on your phone to help too.

Delete the apps you doomscroll on most, it's an addiction, alternatively you can use a passcode to restrict screen time, get a friend or family member to make the passcode and never tell you it. 

There isn't one thing you need to do, there are many but a lot of them are small. If you really want to get out of it you will, just keep at it and record your progress and make sure to look back on it every now and then for a moral boost.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">As a new truck driver, I am getting to see A LOT of the US, and what most people dont understand is there are an overwhelming amount of houses sitting vacant. Rotting. No upkeep being done. Neighborhoods looking like ghost towns due to the 1/2 empty properties sitting around. Homes where families should/could be living being bought up and left vacant.

The land is being bought up by corporations. The homeownership process has become so difficult and expensive that people are having to find other means of "home living." (RVs, cars, tents ect)

The system is broken. There are houses empty all across America, however, they have been made inaccessible for those without generational wealth.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Because the people with money see them as investments first, shelters second. The system is broken. I shouldnt have to make 150k a year to be able to afford a house, especially if there are a ton of lots sitting vacant. The only way this gets solved is through government intervention, but the people buying up property for investments are the same people who strongly advise our politicians. I don't see a way out of this at the moment.</div>

The catch? It's in a town where you either work at a steel mill, a foundry or food service (or similar). There aren't a lot of other opportunities if you're not a doctor or something like that.

It's an 1.5 hours way from any large cities where most of the jobs are.</div>

# Overall Assessment:

The plan’s ambition to tackle tech addiction and rebuild communal values is commendable, but many proposals are **overly authoritarian** and lack nuance. Measures like mandatory service, censorship of influencers, and outright bans risk violating personal freedoms and fostering backlash. While regulating addictive design and funding public goods through taxes are pragmatic steps, success would require global cooperation, careful implementation, and balancing innovation with ethics. Addressing root causes (e.g., mental health support, education reform) may be more effective than punitive measures.

**Verdict**: A provocative starting point for debate, but impractical and ethically fraught in its current form. Incremental, evidence-based policies would likely yield better outcomes.</div>

Reminds me of the old days where any serious programming had to be done in Assembly to ensure maximum performance on the very limited HW we had.

He's accusing DeepSeek of "IP theft" because of the distillation and I wonder, whose IP? Because 99.9% of the IP content OpenAI parsed is stolen. Also a few weeks before the DeepSeek earthquake Altman was accusing smaller companies of "copying OpenAI's approaches" when OpenAI solely exists thanks to copying Google's groundbreaking *Attention is All You Need* paper.

It's infuriating how "Open"AI is constantly taking from the open source community and publicly available research and they never contribute anything to it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’m sure you could design an ASIC around any of these models, but it’s honestly moving too fast to do so. That’ll probably come at some point in the future, however. 

There’s some fascinating people out there. There is a PHD thesis on S tree traversals where the author optimizes for page size and registers on an Intel cpu. Down to the L1,L2 and L3 cache sizes. 

It’ll never run on anything else, and even limited within intel’s own chip line. But, they’ve gotten a 40x speed boost over the record holder. 

Plenty of room down at that level.

It’s not that they couldn’t do it, it’s just that it’s not really reusable. Higher level languages allow you to iterate a lot quicker at the cost of efficiency, which adds up with every abstraction</div>

Can AI make Stuxnet-like weapons or not really? (Especially if you gave it a Zero Day-authentic pass type thing)

Or is AI just helpful to build Stuxnet 100 times faster but only if you already know what you’re doing ?

Or is there no real comparison … like comparing the invention of cement to the blueprint of a beautiful building ?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">An ex-girlfriend of mine - lovely person - was out at a restaurant/bar with a friend one night.  They had a meal and played pool.  When they left, for some reason she drove his car.  I don't know why, but I know that when she and I were together she asked to drive my car just for the experience of driving a different car.  Maybe that was it.  And I imagine, driving in someone else's car, you take a few extra seconds to adjust the seat and the mirrors and get your bearings.

Unbeknownst to her, a teenager was driving a Mustang nearby.  He was pissed because someone passed him a mile earlier, and his ego was hurt.  He decided to catch up to the guy and floored the Mustang, getting up to speeds in excess of 100 mph.

As my ex pulled out of the parking lot to cross the median, she had no way of seeing the Mustang barreling toward her over a hill.  He crashed into her, killing her and her passenger.  Two seconds earlier or later and they would not have made contact.

I went to his trial.  I remember her poor mother sitting there stone-faced while testimony was given.  Several lives were ruined in that moment.  My ex was only 26.  She never got married, never had kids, never found her way in life.</div>

OpenAI whistleblower was trying to raise the alarm about their misuse of copyright material before they could obfuscate all of the evidence. 

So now you can't produce copyrighted material via ChatGPT as a way of proving it was trained on copyrighted material. It alters it just enough that you can't say for certain.

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes depression really is a valid reason for all this, it really is that powerful, and the more unkind to yourself you are (like calling it an excuse, all your "shouldn't have" statements) the worse it gets and the more it paralyzes you. It legally counts as a major disability for a reason.  
If you can't afford therapy, which is the most long term effective treatment but also takes super long to have that effect, fine. Talk to your primary care provider about medicine.  
The only way through this is to absolutely ditch that old hyper-productive expectation of yourself for the time being. You're a human not a machine.   
You will get there again, but that line of thinking is 100% the wrong direction, not the way to get there. You have to start counting every little thing like making a meal as a win. Because it really did take up limited resources of effort and energy to overcome obstacles and get that done. Whether your resources of mental and physical energy should or should not be limited by this 'excuse' does not matter. They just are right now. Illness is not going to work the way you think is fair or acceptable.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The first thing to know about depression is that it mutes your feelings. It makes the world greyscale. That makes it very difficult to get out of because if you no longer know what feels good, so how are you meant to know which direction to go ? This will lead to you falling into a short term dopamine chasing cycle. So underestimating depression is your first mistake

Second mistake is you're trying to sprint, all the time. It's not a sprint, so slow down - you don't need to be david goggins every damn day. Just make some progress each day and that's all you need to do.

Third mistake you've made is you're using external validation. Who cares what others think or thought of your goals and ambitions ? This can, will, and evidently has, led to burn out.

Fourth mistake you've made is you've tied your work ethic to your identity. So what happens when you retire or get hit by a car and can't work ? Find something to build upon that isn't work, it's ok to have work as a core value, but don't make it how you judge yourself.</div>

I decided to stick with subs that are about my true hobbies and passions. r/synthesizers, r/meditation, r/sewing, and a few others.

To be honest, it completely changes my relation to reddit. It is still some kind of distraction, but I cut my usage in half, if not more. I Only spend up to 5 minutes on it before leaving.</div>

Hes raised hundreds of millions and about 2 million total is from healthcare companies

Bernie and AOC are the only people who don't take superpac money, you can see where all their money comes from and the majority is small donors.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm sure what RFK was saying is true. Bernie received the highest amount of donations from pharmaceutical companies.  What Bernie was saying, is it wasn't from the companies themselves, but from people who worked at the corporations.

The single worst law for democracy ever put in place, Citizens United, classifies corporations as people. Donations from minimum wage Wal Mart employees are recorded the same way as donations from Wal Mart the corporation. Same with Pacs and Super Pacs, they're classified as people. Bernie's donations from Pharmaceutical companies are from middle class employees. 

Edit: 

As a self proclaimed Libertarian, RFK should know the difference. He's either misinformed, or purposefully lying.</div>

A very candid admission from a retired USAF Brigadier General Blaine Holt: "I absolutely do not refute that there are extra-terrestrials and that more will be coming out". On the White House drone announcement he said "We need to dive into who's MISINFORMING the President this early in his administration, need to root that out, we need to find out what's going on across this nation....because it's the tip of the iceberg and it's part of something much bigger."

To think they are all lying is just not even plausible imo. This is what tells me there is clearly something to it all.

Edit: I’m done replying to the comments that say “but where is the evidence?”. Yes, of course we need evidence. Hopefully with time we will get it.  You don’t have to believe anything, just consider the possibility at the least.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is one of the facts that surprises me the most. The *caliber* of people coming forward is important in itself. If this was ANY other topic, people would be listening intently to what these people say. Some would straight up take it as matter of fact. 

When it relates to the phenomenon, however, what happens often in this and the other subs is that "this must be a psyop" arguments. Which makes no sense in all honesty. 

If it's a psyop on us, then what's the end goal here? They are just getting people who are already in the topic more invested. Worst case scenario, and it all turns out to be somehow false, we all just go back to our lives, and nothing happened. So what's the point? To make us look "crazy" for a bit? So that John in Accounting laughs a bit at us and then forgets about it all by the end of the week?

And if it's a psyop amongst themselves, they are hitting their own highly decorated, experienced personel just to make them look... crazy? What for? People already distrust the government (mostly), this just make things worse for them cause the argument would be "why keep so many 'crazy' people in important positions." 

We should listen carefully to what these folks are saying, whether you believe it or not, there *is* something going on, and it's fascinating to see ir unfold live. Reality will be weirder than fiction, and I'm all in for it!</div>

You probably have tons of NHI species, you have the gatekeepers, private contractors, billionaires, tons of random low level politicians etc who all want to be gatekeepers

Too many people want a slice once you build a system that encourages an endless conveyor belt of greedy bastards 

They behave like people at the reduced section over money &amp; human power let alone NHI power

Even the good guys, even us

Sure we would disclose, but let’s be honest we would feel like UFO Jesus if we had any clout towards disclosure credit
