                                <div class="reply-body">Yes but this is o3 (low).  The model that passed the original ARC-AGI was a "high" version.  There was controversy over that because of how ridiculously expensive the high version was to pass the test.  The "low" version of o3 performed dramatically more poorly on the original test.

We need to see the "high" version's results to have a fair comparison.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Performance by humans is basically the same for both ARC 1 and ARC 2. 

However, based on the examples on the front page ( [https://arcprize.org/](https://arcprize.org/) ), I think it went from "children-level easy" to just "easy". Some of the examples they published definitely take more than 1min to figure out.

The advantage is that brute-forcing the test seems ridiculously difficult to do. Applying random transformations probably won't be enough anymore.   
  
I just hope the next versions of ARC still keep the "easy for humans, impossible for AI" approach (which, according to François, they will but we'll see)</div>

Generous interpretation is that they are there to give some flavor of the kind of problems ARC presents. Non-generous interpretation is that this is a way to hype up how amazing the test is at revealing AI weaknesses.</div>

The hands and masks look a little goofy. There's room for improvement. But for instruction-following, 10 out of 10. https://imgur.com/a/PHIDJCw</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Hi! I'm one of the founding engineers at Reve. Your test case looks a lot like mine - every day we get a little closer to actually being able to render my D&amp;D party faithfully! I knew we had some magic once I could start to get the right clothing, armor, skin &amp; hair, expressions, weapons &amp; accessories, with 5+ characters all in a specific setting...

Our research team is top-notch so I'm confident that the artifacts I still get in such complicated images (usually hands, ears, confusion about who is holding what &amp; how things are mounted where) will continue to resolve every day.

On the other hand, the images are not up to the quality of Imagen 3 and the faces, particularly when smaller, are not quite as good. I would say more, but I have run out of credits. 
    
I hit some censorship (I was not trying nudity) but it does not seem quite as insanely censored as Imagen 3, a model whose random censorship totally drives me nuts.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Since the whole 'contactee period' back in the 50'/60's... it was seen that there was some measure of fame or money to be made being associated within this realm.

I think the success of the book 'Communion' (the movie was crap) and the 'Fire in the Sky' film along with the 'Taken' series upped the ante.

In recent years, it been about hyping books/documentaries/conferences/podcasts/whatever.. with the 'next big thing - right around the corner!'.

Its hard to tell if this is all tied into a drawn-out acclimation period or if its all just a cash-grab.

While there ARE sone things of note happening with the rebranding of the phenomenon and the US government admitting these craft are real.. they are not going near the final piece - the intelligence behind it - with a ten foot pole (and I'm not buying this recent crap about people being able to summon this 'alien'-tech willy-nilly because they are special or psychic).</div>

Regardless, this is something that should keep happening. We *should* keep trying to make benchmarks that humans easily pass and machines don't. When that's no longer possible that's when you'll know AGI has arrived.

Frankly, if we can still create benchmarks that humans can easily pass and machines cannot, I don't think talk of AGI is very reasonable.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Holy shit humans score 1% on a 6 digit multiplication test where computers get 100%.

Unless one intelligence is a strict subset of the other, it will always be possible to construct a test where one scores well and the other scores poorly.

If the test is no longer a test of general intelligence, then it is of little use.

Edit:also it should be noted that they're fucking around with the results. Humans don't score 100% on these tests. That number is a blatant lie. Instead of taking the average, they count up how many questions *at least one person got right*. It's a bogus test. The whole point was to create a test for general intelligence. They did that with the original agi test. You can't move the goalposts on what general intelligence is! Rename the test entirely - AGI**2** is idiotic.</div>

**edit**

To add more information: Apparently they hired 400 people to solve these puzzles. If anyone solved any problem, they count that as a pass. Because it's not measuring humanity as a whole, it's measuring if any human can beat any AI. They said at least 2 people solved every problem.</div>

"wait" is not an indicator of reasoning, it is a placeholder. (more than likely visual for the end user) 

"Wait" is a term used at the beginning of a sentence to denote a pause and thinking, yes, but it's a human thing, a construct of language and current lexicon.  Slang, if you will.

It has nothing to do with actual reasoning, if you are encountering this it simply means the training data has included many instances of it to give it enough of a weight to be in the prediction of the output.

LLM's have not changed at all, reasoning models are NOT "reasoning" they are simply redoing the math on a more content and consider set of retrieval.

Super duper simplified:

Mary had a little ...

Mary had a little lamb(95)

Wait (check again with dataset)  

dataset contains all the "mary had a little" 

Options: cut (94) finger(45), ball(67), doll(12), bicycle(12), lamb(95).

Then it goes through the options for the next word and so on, eventually coming back to lamb simply because it checked within its results and did not simply pick the first one.

"Reasoning" is running the same prompt through a smaller subset of results for accuracy.


Deepseek has retrained on "reasoning" outputs.</div>

It would also make for more mainstream entertainment(something sorely needed in the AI industry), having all of these companies stream their model playing games on twitch as a benchmark. I kind of feel like Anthropic struck on a really promising thing with this Pokemon Twitch playthrough, and would like to see this be expanded upon.

It would also convince regular people that these models are capable, if they're able to play games and improve at them, rather than just numbers that 99% of people don't understand or care about.</div>

JD Vance, Hegseth, Steven Miller, and others (including former guest, Tulsi Gabbard) then proceeded to discuss and plan, in detail, the attacks on the Houthis. 

Apparently with zero idea the journalist was in the group chat, and apparently with zero concern about using proper channels to discuss classified and national security materials. 

If you thought Hilary's emails were a scandal, you should probably be having an aneurysm over this.</div>

**Full Interview:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku9CYCKw4Aw**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku9CYCKw4Aw)

I think Dave and Alex are two of the most credible witnesses I've ever seen. And the Tic-Tac case remains one of the most corroborated cases of a truly anomalous craft.

Here are some things I found in the past about the Tic-Tac case you guys might find interesting:

&gt;[Popular Mechanics interviews 5 Navy Sailors who witnessed the Tic-Tac encounter on Nimitz. Including a new previously unknown witness who says “What really made this incident alarming was when a Blackhawk helicopter landed on our ship and took all our information from the top secret rooms".](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1iop0vz/popular_mechanics_interviews_5_navy_sailors_who/)

&gt;[Navy Sailor and Nimitz Tic Tac eyewitness Omar Lara tells the amazing story of seeing a Tic Tac UFO up close when it dropped out of sky next to his ship after a crewman fell overboard. Along with many other eyewitnesses (one more named).](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1cx83ub/navy_sailor_and_nimitz_tic_tac_eyewitness_omar/)

&gt;[Former Nimitz Chief Radar Officer Kevin Day goes off on AARO and Kirkpatrick: "They will not contact me or any other radar watchstander. Why? They don't want to know the truth and/or are afraid to say they don't know jack shit".](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1bm39y9/former_nimitz_chief_radar_officer_kevin_day_goes/)

&gt;[Tic-Tacs were recorded on advanced radar to be going at least 80 thousand feet (15 miles) in less than a second.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/162psp2/tic_tacs_recroded_on_advanced_radar_to_be_going/)

                                <div class="reply-body">Sean Cahill was quoted as saying Fravor initially believed the sighting was US technology or a decoy and only changed his story once he started getting attention from the ufo club at the pentagon. 

Now, should we believe Cahill?  I don’t see why not. He was part of the group. 

There’s also evidence of Fravors ego and why stroking that could get you what you want. His callsign is/was SEX but he initially tried to get sexual and was denied. Sexual Fravor. 

Again I have no idea what was seen or what happened but between that story and Project Nemesis I think we can say the Nimitz event could have been an electronic warfare weapons test with a decoy used for a visual. 

It really all makes sense if you stop with the initial narrative from the ufo group and only pay attention to what we know and connect those dots. 

I know it’s not as exciting as aliens but that’s life.</div>

Let's remain in the present and offer a list of places anyone can go to in order to go *experience* instead of forever remaining stuck in hearsay....

Ever since discovering that this exists, *all* other forms of disclosure frankly feel like distractions from their already daily presence. Now. Not years ago in a one off sighting. But happening now, every day, since November somewhere. December in other places. Depends on where you ask.</div>

Something we all need to keep in mind is that pilots have had these very intense contact experiences and have to often go through an existential crisis in the air **and any of us could be in the plane when this happens**.  They have no official channels to report this that will result in investigations and they are subject to the stigma still and they are left often times having trauma because they can’t discuss it openly.</div>

We are now on a r2 vs o3 vs gemini 2 pro thinking watch.

R2 has a chance to be first released and the best of those 3. And the cheapest of the 3. And the only open source one. Wild.</div>

This doesn't show in the mainstream benchmarks but if you care about obscure information regarding some random dialect of some primitive tribe then 4.5 will perform way better than Deepseek v3. I am not saying that it's useful, and I would much rather have a cheap capable for normal tasks model but still, if you want an AI encyclopedia of the world then 4.5 is the best by far right now.</div>
