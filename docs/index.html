They’re still plentiful enough, while being cheap to buy and own. If i were your age, i’d def consider buying one of the Japanese options while they bottom out on price. Having secondary fun cars isnt viable for most, but with current prices of these. it isnt obscenely expensive compared to 90s icons. Un-clapped 2000s sports cars are becoming rare already.</div>

Who the hell still makes cars like that? The 718 GTS 4.0 that just got killed off and the unobtanium 911 GT3?

Other than that, is the only option left V8 Mustangs?

Edit: Totally forgot the Miata and the 86 twins.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Having owned every one of those cars except the Beetle, you didn't miss anything. The early 2000s were awful for sport coupes (and sports compacts in general). The RSX Type S was a shadow of the Integra it replaced, the Celica GT-S embarrassed every Celica that came before, the Tiburon was overweight and underpowered for what it was and sloppy as hell to boot, and the only thing worse than the 3rd Gen Eclipse was the 4th Gen Eclipse.

People look at these cars with nostalgia now, but a) every one of these cars was better before the 2000's, and b) Today's cars are so much better than any of these that it's laughable to compare. This was a truly awful in-between generation that had already lost much of the rawness and connection that 80's and 90's cars had, but hadn't yet figured out how to go fast or handle well the way truly modern cars do.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Also plugging these into the inflation calculator makes it wild, these things weren't cheap as tested.

1. The RSX Type S would be about $42,500.

2. The Celica would be $44,500.

3. The Eclipse would be $47,600.

4. The Tiburon would be almost $35,000.

5. The Beetle would be almost $43,800

If any cars these days had similar interiors, they would be blasted by reviewer.</div>

&gt;How about setting the dollar target in the low-$20,000 range? Can we show you something in a sports coupe, emphasis on driving fun?

That's about $36,500 USD in today's money. Even then, most young people can't afford that anymore. 

Tiburon GT = Dead
RSX = EV Crossover
Celica = Dead
Eclipse = Dead
Beetle = Dead

The industry has fallen pretty far.</div>

Elantra N.

&gt;Acura RSX

Civic SI is close enough, or there's the Integra.

&gt;Celica

GR Corolla.

&gt;Beetle

Jetta GLI or Golf GTI.

The industry still has plenty of cheap, fun, available cars. Hell, most of those I listed are even in the ballpark of $36k - most of them are under the $42k ish that a 2002 RSX Type S would be in today's dollars anyways. They're also all faster, more comfortable, and more economical.

If you want a two-door specifically there's the BRZ/GT86, ND, Ecoboost Mustang, 400Z...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">$36,500 today will get you a Mazda3 Turbo, a Golf GTI, a Toyota GR86, Mazda Miata, Elantra N.  I don’t think the industry has fallen far. Except Subaru, you could get a WRX brand new for $30k just a couple years ago and now they start at $38k. They’ve fallen pretty far. 

People definitely don’t have the buying power they used to though, but that’s not the manufacturers fault.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Before the wires started retracting, Noland was talking about how Neurolink people were talking to him that he should really consider if he wants to be the first patient, as there is a decent chance they might need to remove the implant or won't be able to upgrade it or that, when new models come out, he might not be eligible for the better implants, but Noland said he still wants to do it, he wants to pave the road for others and it was pretty awesome to hear.   
  
It's a shame the threads retracted a bit, but I'm glad they managed to keep the implant functioning, considering the bravery of Noland. Now that the implant changed his life so much, it would be heartbreaking if they had to remove it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">People here need to understand that it’s perfectly fine to have opinions about Musk. He’s a controversial figure, and that will always influence how people judge anything he does.

However, it’s also important to discuss the technology itself without constantly shifting the focus to him, because that only harms the conversation about the actual topic.

Advances in this field matter. Neuralink is not the only player in this space, and unlike many here, I can’t say for sure whether they’re ahead of their competitors or not—but they certainly draw media attention.

One point I’d like to raise is how some people here talk about those with disabilities. Being disabled doesn’t mean they’ll accept anything without question. Everyone has the right to their own standards and preferences, and assuming otherwise is pure ignorance.

Keep in mind that invasive technologies are often abandoned, leaving participants without support and preventing them from joining future projects. So, no matter how challenging someone’s situation may be, they still face a tough decision when choosing to participate in something like this.

It requires a great deal of trust.</div>

                <div class="post-content">A year ago, I was at complete rock bottom. Daily panic attacks, couldn't go to school, failed all my exams, severe insomnia where I'd stay awake for days. I was basically a shut-in (hikikomori) just lying in bed watching shows and gaming because I was in too much psychological pain to function. I had nothing left to lose, so I figured I'd try meditation.

Meditation makes us aware of who we are.  From there we can make changes, if we want to.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I just came here to add, having financial safety is having a sense of safety. Only when you have enough of it that you feel safe, you can stop thinking about it. There is nothing wrong in wanting to be safe. I don't know about "influence" though.

From working with young people (13-17) I noticed that they were overall more obsessed with money that I remember myself and my peers at that age (Millennial). Don't get me wrong, having a thing was a source of pride, and not having a thing was often _devastating_. But now, if you don't have money, you are nothing. That's the sense I am getting. My take is, this obsession is what is in you and around you, and now you can see it clearly. As with any obsession: be careful ..and good luck.

Your meditation practice is impressive and brings real benefits! Don't get too obsessed though haha 😉</div>

When I was feeling my best, someone would ask me what I did yesterday and I could absolutely not remember, and I didn’t really care to take the time to strain to remember. I rathered to stay in the now. As far as the future goes, I largely stopped caring and it felt great. This also scared me because the irreverence made me uneasy. I didn’t desire any control. Damn it was a great ride. Trying to get back there but maybe not to such a high degree…</div>

"Energy restriction is closely related to cellular senescence and species longevity. Here, based on the structure and function of ATP synthase, a key enzyme for energy generation, we develop energy metabolism-engaged nanomedicines (EM-eNMs) to rejuvenate aged stromal/stem cells, and help to prevent skeletal ageing. We show that EM-eNMs infiltrate the mitochondria of aged bone marrow mesench...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is really interesting because it goes beyond the usual antioxidant or NAD+ replenishment strategies we see in longevity. Targeting ATP synthase directly to re-engage mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy is a more upstream intervention, almost like flipping the switch on the cell’s energy engine rather than patching the damage after the fact.

The fact that these nanomedicines not only rejuvenated BMMSCs in vitro but also reversed bone loss in aged mice makes it look like a genuine systems-level effect, not just a biomarker tweak. If this translates, it could mean a way to maintain stem cell function and tissue regeneration capacity deep into ageing.

It also raises the question of whether similar mitochondrial-targeted nanomedicines could be designed for other tissues, like neural or cardiac, where stem cell exhaustion and mitochondrial dysfunction are major drivers of decline. This feels like a step toward precision longevity therapeutics rather than broad metabolic hacks.</div>

And when I moved to canada, despite the fact that their houses are 10 times bigger, everybody is machine driying their clothes and laughing at me for being cheap to try to save a few dollars by not having a machine. 

It s not for saving everybody, it s just to keep my clothes nice for longer. Even if not deformed, the fabric gets used and bleh with a machine.</div>

To be frank I think this has been brewing since the civil war, Trump was just johnny on the spot that harnessed that hatred that had been laying there rudderless. You went from slavery into segregation and when LBJ took that away the Republicans created groups focussed on packing the courts with judges who think a certain way. Up until Trump republicans had leaders that would denounce the [overt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIjenjANqAk) racism. Trump was the first one that showed them they didn't have to hide it anymore. Social media threw gas on the fire making it easy for people to be vulgarians to one another and ramp up that tribalism.

It would seem their only "principle" is they dislike the other side. They yapped on about the constitution for how long but crickets when Trump tried to get Pence to go against it.

I think your only way out is education over generations but they're suspicious of that too so don't hold your breath. With the benefit of hindsight I think Lincoln would've let Sherman go a lot harder than he did. Should've gone full Carthage.</div>

They're the smallest men in the world, spiritually speaking (also Joe is 4 feet tall).

Wielding power makes them feel important and significant, it's like a drug. Rogan felt SO SPECIAL for getting involved and influencing the election. For a few glorious months, he felt 10 feet tall.

The thing is, the reason doesn't matter. The result doesn't matter. The mere act of exerting power, even incoherently, even illogically, even to the detriment of everyone, gives them that sense of self-importance.</div>

So much body tension... Really forces you to stay tight throughout the trunk. I also recently managed strict RMU and the feeling is very similar: maximal strength via bodyweight only, a pretty unique feeling as far as CF movements go.

                <div class="post-content">Hey everyone,  
I've noticed that recently all my chatGPT chats were becoming longer and it was hard to navigate through them. So I built [ChatSight](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatsight-chatgpt-prompt/aamihahiiogceidpbnfgehacgiecephe?authuser=0&amp;hl=en) \- **a neatly designed chrome extension to instantly show all user questions/prompts in a ChatGPT chat.**

ChatSight also displays the **total number of questions/prompts you have asked in a chat** and also **shows token count** ...</div>

Regarding the data, chrome has a very strict review process. This extension won't be in the store if I'm doing anything shady. ChatSight computes everything locally.

You’re not including the water use of building a farm, the rainfall loss of burning the Amazon for pasture, of the rise in global temperature from the obnoxious amount of methane. 

Which really is criminally underestimated as a source of temperature gains.

"The knock on GPT-5 is that it nudges the frontier of A.I. capabilities forward rather than obliterates previous limits. I’m not here to argue otherwise. OpenAI has been releasing new models at such a relentless pace — the powerful o3 model came out four months ago — that it has cannibalized the shock we might have felt if there...</div>

It has not improved in terms of agentic usability, despite OpenAI staff teasing this for months. GPT-5 also isn't a unified model the way OpenAI planned it to be. This shouldn't be that complicated. Others have done it already. Instead it is a very basic router that fails way too often.

The bearish signal from GPT-5 isn't about model capability, it's about OpenAI failing the meet system functionality targets for GPT-5 that were relatively unambitious to begin with.</div>

That said I have had it give me bad info before, but I tend to search for things I can't figure out myself, niche knowledge and stuff, or questions that don't actually have an answer because I don't know any better. Those things AI isn't going to be good for in the first place.</div>

To make products with technology like this you just need raw material (atoms and molecules), information (product blue prints), and energy. There are more than enough of those resources in the solar system to sustain trillions of lives. And these devices will be essentially self replicating so “hoarding” them will be impossible.

It checks websites across a several different industries, uses AI to analyze which ones are bad, and extracts the data for bad ones. When all is said and done, I can export it to an excel sheet and sell the leads. I've been able to generate several hundred a day.</div>

We're about to see how technology advancing much more rapidly than legislation can create huge issues. Art, music, movies.. it's all going to be flooded with AI generated content and a lot of it will resemble existing art, music, and movies. 

It's going to be interesting to see how it plays out.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;There's now a growing trend, though, for established (but not superstar) artists to be targeted by fake albums or songs that suddenly appear on their pages on Spotify and other streaming services. 


Spotify makes this really easy. When two artists have the same name it just munges them together. I've seen it happen again and again, artists with the same name all get smashed into a single page and going through releases you can go from ambient to rap. All clearly different artists.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is drop dead stupid. If I'm an artist and I have an artist page, why the hell is anything being uploaded on my own page without my consent? Wouldn't this be solved on a dime by just having a notification alert saying, "hey, an external source is trying to add X to your page, is this your work?"

Why isn't that already a feature? This is clownish.

A while ago I've seen this happen to, IIRC, Blackmill. Suddenly like 10 albums of AI slop got uploaded to his page. He had to comment on "his own" songs, attached to his account, saying *"hey everybody this is Blackmill, and this isn't my song nor album, I'm trying to get this taken down..."* Meanwhile the other comments were like *"this is sooo good!,"* believing they are listening to (1) real music by (2) the right artist, which is its own form of peculiar dystopianism we've already slipped into.

Btw his comments were months old. Meaning everything was still on his account. Apparently artists don't even have the tools nor ability to take down stuff on their own accounts. What the actual fuck is wrong with these music platforms?

If I didn't play with Suno enough to know its thumbprint and identify the slop it makes, I perhaps would have never known this. Because I listen to Blackmill's genre and that slop randomly came up on my song station for that genre. I remember thinking, *"huh... what is this song... why is Suno playing on YouTube Music?"* Checked the artist and was like *"there's no fucking way he'd be using AI to make music."* Hence my investigation.</div>
