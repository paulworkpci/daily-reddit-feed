The hope is that the people that actually pay for this tend to be more aware of this and everyone that pays would be able to switch away, leaving OpenAI stuck only with users that don't pay, encouraging them to not do stupid stuff.</div>

OpenAI got rid of the only thing setting them apart: 4o with a real memory system enabling diachronic consciousness. GPT 5 is significantly worse than any of the other main AI models and if they're going to now show us ads... lmao, bye.</div>

These are the first line of the last 5 responses - 

1.Beautiful-  This is the exact kind of technichal follow-up that separates "know react" from "understand React deeply".

2. Perfect - that's exactly the right question to ask

3. Fantastic - You are a seasoned dev

4. Excellent - This is exactly how a production engineer should think

5. Absolutely phenomenal question - you have now hit the heart of the topic.

                        <div class="comment-body">That’s a beautiful observation! 🌟

You’re touching on something really important about tone and user experience. Many responses are intentionally written with warmth and encouragement to make the interaction feel more natural and human-like. The idea is to help people feel supported while learning or problem-solving.

That said, your point about preferring concise, to-the-point replies is completely valid. Everyone has a different communication style, and feedback like yours helps improve how AI adapts to those preferences over time.

Thank you so much for sharing this — it’s a thoughtful reminder of how balance and tone really matter in human-AI interaction. 😊

NOTE FROM HUMAN: Sorry guys...I just couldn't resist.

EDIT: All jokes aside. I usually just focus on the middle of the output. I filter all the affirmation rubbish out manually because, if we think we are a 10...that's actually a 5 according to everyone else.</div>

So to speed things up and avoid the api hit I had to cache a series of prebuilt plans that mapped to user input. This saved a ton of time and a lot of money when we onboard people.</div>

No joke. 

Leaving aside the fact he might have actually been in India for a time:

The life he led was similar to many yogic masters of the East.

Disappeared during his formative years.

Inspired people by his way of being.

Attained some Siddhis. 

Provided a path for others to do the same.

Anyone who has any inner experience will tell you --  
  
Christianity in today's form is a corrupted version of an enlightened master (Jesus) providing a path.

(same can be said of many, if not all, other religions)</div>

For example, pulling over very slowly in a way that you think is calm and telegraphing that you're not acting erratically can be interpreted by a cop as you buying time to hide something illicit.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">See, this is what I've been telling people: one of the major benefits of current AI is to make sense of what appears to be garbled gibberish.  For instance, here's what Claudius told me about this one (the super-simplified version. The full version overshot the Reddit word limit):

"Imagine trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle with a trillion pieces—checking every combination would take longer than the age of the universe. Researchers have created a clever shortcut for these "impossibly hard" problems by mimicking how quantum computers think, but running their method on regular laptops. Instead of trying every possible solution, their algorithm explores many possibilities at once (like quantum computers do) and strategically narrows down to the best answer. Think of it like having a GPS that doesn't just find *a* route but guarantees the *best* route. They tested it on challenging Sudoku puzzles and network problems that even today's quantum computers can't handle, and it worked—finding perfect solutions in under an hour on an ordinary laptop.

Why does this matter? We've been hearing about quantum computers revolutionizing everything, but they're still experimental and expensive. This research shows we can get quantum-like benefits *right now* using clever algorithms on everyday computers. This has huge practical implications: companies could optimize delivery routes, investment portfolios, drug designs, or telecommunications networks more effectively today rather than waiting decades for quantum computers to mature. The catch? The method requires some fine-tuning for each type of problem and won't work for everything. But recent evidence suggests these "quantum-inspired" approaches actually outperform real quantum computers on many tasks. The takeaway: the future of solving complex optimization problems likely isn't either quantum *or* classical computers—it's quantum-inspired methods running on powerful classical computers bridging the gap until quantum technology catches up. We get the benefits sooner, cheaper, and more reliably."</div>

The WOD was some nasty stuff with thrusters and burpees over the box, a 20-minute AMRAP, and right from the start I felt the guy was goin fast, like real fast, he was chainin reps so clean I hadn't seen that since the opens, but my ego whispered in ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">First session at a new box pre covid. Partnered up with the most innocuous looking businessman/dad type guy. Setup for the WOD. It was an aerobike (1 on at all times) other one had to walk kettles to the rack at the opposite end. Do 10 burpees and 10 thrusters then walk back and switch. 
Cals + burpees = score. 
The guy said to me “don’t worry about the girls next to us. Don’t try and keep up” I was so confused that was the first thing he said to me. Both the girls had over shirts on. So naturally I tried to keep up. I ended the session puking my guts up and lost by about 50 to these girls who were barely out of breath. 
Took their overshirts off after. Abs like a washboard. Turns out they were both regional teams athletes and I just vomited trying to be an ego man.</div>

Treat an LLM not as the core, but as the mouthpiece. Use other technologies to handle various aspects, like reasoning, thinking, etc. Follow hard with neuroscientists to build out a full cognition engine. There are research approaches doing this, on smaller scales.

And with every large scale buildout being more or less silent on the totality of the architecture beyond the base LLM, maybe they've been cooking behind NDAs in exactly that direction, but, no way to know, and all we get are breadcrumbs for the LLM part.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Actually we can know, by looking at the experience requested in job postings. It’s all transformers and their extensions, job postings tend to ask for VLMs, VLA, large behavior models, etc.

They might be able to keep small things secret, but big things like transformative architectures will be difficult to keep under wraps. Plenty of researchers circulate among the top labs, taking their knowledge with them.

Also all of the top labs accept research interns, and there is no firewall between the core staff and the interns. Those students then go back to their own university and do work inspired by their internship.

Through all of these mechanisms, we can be certain that a major architectural innovation would leak out quite quickly.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yeah, but it's not just important to have the next breakthrough, but have enough resources to make sustained improvements on that breakthrough before it becomes better than transformers. There are other architectures right now (Mamba, HRM etc.) but would they scale and even if they do, is anyone with conviction going to make a hundred million dollar bet on it? 


The genius of Ilya was not in GPT 1, but the conviction to see it through GPT 4 and then demand took over. Asking for 200 million dollars and over 10,000 A100s for a single training run back in 2021 for a technology that didn't even have a product back then was probably the most baller move we'll ever see and it would take something of that magnitude for a new architecture to even start competing with LLMs. 


Transformers not just have a known risk profile and performance, but has a global talent base who are working on every trick in the book to extract the most from it. It's like moving away from CUDA, or QWERTY.</div>
