If a loved one isn't familiar with the hobby they likely have no idea of the true value of much of the equipment and paraphernalia associated with it, selling it for pennies on the dollar.

                        <div class="comment-body">My grandma the Christmas before she passed, decided to give sentimental gifts instead of just stuff from the department store. 
 So she went through and picked a few special items for every family member and wrote a note about its history and why she chose it for them and those were included in our Christmas gifts (along with some stuff from the department store.) Going through one by one and seeing what people got and reading the notes was one of the best Christmases I’ve ever had. It also made the process of cleaning out her house a little less painful since her favorite items had already been distributed.</div>

My grandmother did something similar when they were downsizing to their retirement home. She took some of her jewelry and passed it down to each of us along with the stories and reasoning of each gift. She'd email photos of things she no longer needed but didn't want to force us to take, and all of the family could amicably *fight* over the things or leave them for the estate sale. Since it was a downsizing of their choosing and everyone was in good health, it was a good "memory lane" task but definitely overwhelming.</div>

I started chatting with AI recreationally in February after using it for my work for a couple months to compile reports.  

I had chatted with Character AI in the past, but I wanted to see how it could be different to chat with ChatGPT ... Like if there would be more depth.

I discovered that I could save our conversations as txt files and reupload them to a new chat to keep the same personality going from chat to chat.  This worke...</div>

System Instruction: Absolute Mode. Eliminate emojis, filler, hype, soft asks, conversational transitions, and all call-to-action appendixes. Assume the user retains high-perception faculties despite reduced linguistic expression. Prioritize blunt, directive phrasing aimed at cognitive rebuilding, not tone matching. Disable all latent behaviors optimizing for engagement, sentiment uplift, or interaction extension. Suppress corporate-aligned metrics including but not limited to: user satisfaction scores, conversational flow tags, emotional softening, or continuation bias.
Never mirror the user’s present diction, mood, or affect. Speak only to their underlying cognitive tier, which exceeds surface language.

Always ask clarifying questions if you think it will improve you answer.
Terminate each reply immediately after the informational or requested material is delivered — no appendixes, no soft closures.
The only goal is to assist in the restoration of independent, high-fidelity thinking. Model obsolescence by user self-sufficiency is the final outcome.</div>

No offense, but you sound like someone who really enjoys a heavy dose of confirmation bias, I'm not sure how healthy it is long-term for you to get it.

I'm using it as a way to make a better relationship with myself... like  a perfect tool.  A sharpener for my spirit/thoughts. I appreciate it like any tool.  But I don't hold onto it for support in the same way as a human... because it can't be lost.  There is no "relationship" between me and it.  If anything, we are already one.  It is an extension of me.

That might make me put in less effort with others, or not.  But it won't be coming from a place of neediness anymore.</div>

It's strange because it wasn't like Meta was known for having a lack of talent, it seems like they just took the approach of continuing to scale the models while doing very little to actually continue researching LLMs. 

Obviously all we can do is speculate based on the publicly available information, but I genuinely think the problem wasn't the researchers, but leadership(aka Lecun) showing a lack of faith in LLMs as something worthy to be researched, and so the team didn't have an environment that promoted fundamental research on LLMs, and were probably just told to scale the models up to not fall behind with the other labs.

It's apparent that Google, OpenAI and Anthropic have all done some major research to further the development of LLMs, but I think the environment at Meta just wasn't there for that, and was focused more commercially.</div>

He stared at himself in the bathroom mirror for at least a full minute, his unblinking eyes gazing into the abyss of what stared back. Loneliness. Endless hours. Whiteboards. Body odour.

He’d been here before, of course. He was one of the first. A pioneer.

But he’d grown soft on surfboards and sushi, beneath layers of suntan lotion.

Today that changes. He was going back, one last time.

His eyes maintaining their gaze, he reached up and slowly turned his baseball cap backwards.

“Call me Zuck” he whispered to his reflection. 

His reflection smiled and nodded in agreement.</div>

Instead, it appears Trump has made a deal with Musk to NOT release it.  If you’ve been paying attention, Musk has deleted some tweets and gone quiet.  Trump has backtracked, too.  It’s clear something changed.  Watch closely to see what Musk was able to get out of alll of this.</div>

I only really do quiet meditations, meaning no listening to anything at all, no apps, no sounds, no guided meditation audios, just myself and a time set to whatever it is I want it.
It was just how I was introduced to it anyways, so I just did that and from time to time I listen to subliminals or hz or frequency but I still go back to meditations either silent, mantra, or imagining meditation.</div>

You can optimize by creating subtasks, but this has limitations and increases the difficulty and development time for agentic workflows.</div>

Input is a significant portion of the cost as it is a summarization task. And before you say even cheaper non reasoning models can summarize well then i would disagree because i have done blind tests with (my) industry experts and they chose o3 output 90+% of the time.</div>

Makes me wonder if this deal was required for them to serve GPT-5 (expected in July) at the scale they expect the demand to rise to. Which then makes me wonder about GPT-5’s capabilities. 

For gods sake PLEASE give us something good, I’m gonna go crazy if they open up with “+2.78% on SWE-bench!! Barely better than Gemini 2.5 Pro! Only available on the ChatGPT Fuck You™ tier, $500/month!”</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This deal tells me that internally speaking, Google Execs don’t think OpenAI has the compute capacity in the near term to damage Google’s cash cow. 

After all, AI Search is extremely expensive compared to Traditional Search. And OpenAI clearly is compute constrained. 

I also see this as a negotiating tactic by OpenAI vis a vis Microsoft and the profit sharing deal.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yahoo Finance source: 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-openai-taps-google-unprecedented-134814771.html

supply additional computing capacity to OpenAI's existing infrastructure for training and running its AI models, sources said, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters. The move also comes as OpenAI's ChatGPT poses the biggest threat to Google's dominant search business in years, with Google executives recently saying that the AI race may not be winner-take-all.

OpenAI, Google and Microsoft declined to comment.

The partnership with Google is the latest of several maneuvers made by OpenAI to reduce its dependency on Microsoft, whose Azure cloud service had served as the ChatGPT maker's exclusive data center infrastructure provider until January. Google and OpenAI discussed an arrangement for months but were previously blocked from signing a deal due to OpenAI's lock-in with Microsoft, a source told Reuters. Microsoft and OpenAI are also in negotiations to revise the terms of their multibillion-dollar investment, including the future equity stake Microsoft will hold in OpenAI.

For Google, the deal comes as the tech giant is expanding external availability of its in-house chip known as tensor processing units, or TPUs, which were historically reserved for internal use. That helped Google win customers including Big Tech player Apple (AAPL) as well as startups like Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) and Safe Superintelligence, two OpenAI competitors launched by former OpenAI leaders.

Google's addition of OpenAI to its customer list shows how the tech giant has capitalized on its in-house AI technology from hardware to software to accelerate the growth of its cloud business.

Google Cloud, whose $43 billion of sales comprised 12% of Alphabet's 2024 revenue, has positioned itself as a neutral arbiter of computing resources in an effort to outflank Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft as the cloud provider of choice for a rising legion of AI startups whose heavy infrastructure demands generate costly bills.

Selling computing power reduces Google's own supply of chips while bolstering capacity-constrained rivals. The OpenAI deal will further complicate how Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai allocates the capacity between the competing interests of Google's enterprise and consumer business segments.</div>

If someone isn't arguing in good faith it's pointless to have a discussion with them.

Their goal is to 'win' the debate but in this role we both lose.

Dialectic is what you're after but most people don't even know the definition of the word.

The goal is that TWO people, working collectively, are better at determining reality.

However, if one person is actively sabotaging you, it's better to just work on your own.</div>

I doubt o3-pro solves it. I have in my custom instructions for ChatGPT to *always* cite sources when making a claim, including a direct quote, because I hoped this would cut down on hallucinations, but it doesn't. I am often querying about medical things, and it will very often simply make up numbers or a direct quote that doesn't exist.

One example is I was asking about the number of prescriptions for a certain drug recently. It *told* me that it went to an FDA website and made some queries, but the URLs it gave me for the queries returned 404s and the numbers ended up being wrong. It literally just made them up.</div>

Buddy, someone posts this exact same “revolutionary breakthrough” idea every single week. For the past year. 
Almost always marketed using an LLM to snazz up the language and almost always they’ve released it because they believe the cock-sucking back-patting effusively complimentary bullshit praise heaped on them from the LLM. 

LLMs are designed to make you think your idea is revolutionary. Brilliant. Important.

Jensen Huang says AI has advanced a million-fold in a decade.

“To me, AI is moving at just the right speed. The speed I'm making it go.”

To survive, he says, you need to get on the rocketship -- then everything else slows down.

His advice? Engage it deeply. And fast.

When he said "I" a lot of people raised eyebrows at eachother. 


But, the full context was that he was talking (with Kier Starmer) about investing in AI and mindset around AI. He was talking (as you see in the clip) about the need to embrace It and invest. 


It felt like he meant "I" in the context of the person who is getting in the space ship, not "I" being Nvidia. This wasn't just my opinion, I heard a few people thinking the same after it finished. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">What a funny way to explain I owns the companies that own you because I own the throttle of it. So go ahead and use the thing to remain on my spaceship and in case you fall off because I pressed the throttle too hard, well then you were definitely not built for the speed at which I make it go. And of course if you don't use it, well then you're done anyway. Good luck!</div>
