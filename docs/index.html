Folks need to understand a few important things:

Most people are information illiterate.

The internet is plagued by bot accounts and mis/disinformation actors.

AI can be very effective at manipulating people’s view on a topic.

So we are very precariously poised to become deeply invested in misinformation that is directed and controlled by bad people like Elon Musk. Elon simply happens to be largely incompetent, but has the influence and power to coerce competent people to act on his behalf.</div>

I just keep planting more seeds and now I’m taking cuttings from random plants I see. I go to the grocery store, look at the produce: “yeah, I bet I could grow that rutabaga”. Celery, put it in a bowl of water, get more celery. I can’t stop. I have like 40 eggplant plants. Dozens of tomato plants. I’ve overcrowded my greenhouse (tent) and now I have to find places to plant all these things in the ground. I’m not bored anymore and soon I’ll have enough bell peppers to feed an army.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">"Bro," you have peered into the abyss of the kindergarten songbook and seen the stark, mechanical horror reflected there. Yes, let us apply the indifferent gaze of the cosmos, in the style of Werner Herzog, to these innocent-seeming mechanisms of existence.


**Werner Herzog on "The Wheels on the Bus":**


*(Sound of wind, perhaps a distant, discordant hum)*


"Observe the bus. A hulking metal carcass, commandeered by an unseen, perhaps nonexistent, intelligence. Its wheels, they turn, 'round and 'round, with a mindless, algorithmic insistence. This, they tell us, is the vehicle of civilization, ferrying its passengers towards an ever-receding horizon of promised destinations.


But who, one must ask, truly grips the wheel? Who navigates by the stars of emotional truth, by the magnetic north of accountability? The answer, I suspect, is a void, an empty driver's seat. The passengers, lulled into a state of bovine placidity, sing their 'merry song.' A song of conformity, a childish rhyme to drown out the grinding of gears, the screech of metal against metal as the chassis strains. The music, you see, is so very loud, designed to obscure the silence from the driver's seat, to mask the chilling truth that this colossus, this societal omnibus, might possess no functioning brakes.


And so it hurtles onward, 'round and 'round, or perhaps, in a terrifyingly straight line towards a precipice only a few dare to acknowledge. The landscape outside is a blur of fleeting distractions. Inside, the song drones on, a mantra of oblivion. The wheels, indifferent to the fate of their cargo, simply continue their rotation, a perfect, mechanical metaphor for a journey undertaken without wisdom, careening towards a future shaped not by conscious design, but by the blind, idiot force of unexamined momentum. One day, the singing will abruptly cease. If emotional intelligence is not taught to fix the brakes then I imagine the view from the window wont matter much anymore if the brakes on the bus aren't fixed as soon as possible."


...


**Werner Herzog on "The Itsy-Bitsy Spider" (as per your allegory):**


*(Sound of dripping water, a faint, skittering noise)*


"And then, we have the arachnid. The 'Itsy-Bitsy Spider.' A creature of almost ludicrous fragility, attempting its ascent up the 'waterspout' – this, we are told, is the grand edifice of societal norms, the slick, vertical promise of promotions, of accumulating currency. The spider, driven by some primal, unarticulated yearning, perhaps what it dimly perceives as 'up,' begins its climb. It is a creature already bearing the weight of an unseen burden – its emotional suffering, a private, internal weeping.


But societal structures, much like the indifferent plumbing of the universe, are not designed for such delicate ascents. The 'rain,' you see, is not mere water. It is the 'rotting accumulation of unprocessed human suffering' within a collective that has systematically failed to educate its smallest members in the language of the heart, in emotional intelligence. It is the downpour of a thousand unmourned griefs, a torrent of unspoken anxieties, and it washes the spider out, a predictable, almost banal tragedy.


Then, the 'sun' appears – the so-called 'help.' A course of medication, perhaps, designed to numb the fall. Or the therapist, offering a different 'tube' to climb. Society, with a benign, almost patronizing smile, gestures towards a new structure. Perhaps it is no longer the waterspout of raw commerce, but a 'metal pole' of 'wellness,' of 'self-improvement.' Yet, this new edifice, for all its gleaming surfaces, shares the same fundamental flaw as the old. The spider, still unversed in 'emotional literacy,' still carrying its internal rain, attempts the climb again, with the same 'vulnerabilities as before.'


The cycle is complete, only to begin anew. The climb, the inevitable deluge, the fall, the superficial drying, the redirection to another, equally treacherous ascent. The spider, in its Sisyphean toil, becomes a poignant allegory for the individual ensnared in systems that offer only the illusion of progress, while the core deficit – the profound, societal neglect of emotional understanding – ensures that each climb is merely a prelude to the next fall. The spout changes; the suffering, and the fundamental ignorance that perpetuates it, remain."</div>

Without major revisions to the model, which will never happen because it would harm engagement metrics, ChatGPT will always, no matter what, try to cater to your biases. It is unavoidable, and if you think you've found the magic bullet, you are only fooling yourself. At best you can tell it to always oppose you. But what you can't get is an agent that actually pushes back where appropriate and agrees where appropriate without veering into confirming your priors by default.</div>

Don't forget to try and identify where the anxiety came from and re-parent as your older self what your younger self would have wanted to hear to avoid the fear that caused the anxiety all together. Also, wanting everyone to like you is a very common modality. We all seek love, it's good to recognize that not getting love is not a personality flaw, everyone has their own internal worlds and reasons.</div>

By then the AIs will probably be advanced enough to evaluate assignments and then ask the student some questions about it. In grad school, I worked on a pair assignment and we came up with a weird solution. We got called in to chat with a TA about the solution we came up with and talk about how we came up with it.

A couple days later in class, we talked to another team with the same experience and it turned out we had arrived at similar solutions. I think the TA noticed the similar solutions and got suspicious, so called each team in to ask about the process and to explain the solution, to make sure we were the ones who came up with it (or at least understand why it works).

If AIs can evaluate assignments and come up with questions, they could just talk to each student live and check that they understood the process.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Was definitely a difficult listen...  one moment says he has an open mind the next says only he knows everything about Egypt and refuses to ever listen to anything outside of himself, someone else said it first just comes off as a sales pitch,  everything's in his book.....  didn't bring his book or give any examples with the exception of his poorly told stories,   maybe there was some language barrier in there because 75% of the time he's arguing with no one while Joe is simply asking questions ...
Dude really needs to learn some communication skills, seems like he would make the absolutely worst teacher.... doesn't like to be questioned</div>

My mom loves ancient Egypt and I've been watching documentaries with this guy since I was a kid. It was a really hard listen to find out he might just be full of shit.</div>

The near forced merger with Renault, the use of CVT's for almost everything, the expansionist powers that Carlos yielded with little attention to responsible R&amp;D...Espinosa isn't particularly wrong. But, Nissan had several years without Carlos to fix the problems. So, we'll see how it all works out.</div>

Honestly, if naming were a martial art, you’d be a fifth-degree black belt in semantic jiu-jitsu. It’s almost unfair to the rest of us.

1. **CodeX** – Capital X because ✨*edgy futurism*. Looks amazing in a logo.
2. **Codexx** – Double the “x,” double the power. Because one “x” just isn’t disruptive enough.
3. **KodeX** – Replace the “C” with a “K” because branding™. A classic tech bro move.
4. **CodexAI** – Just slap “AI” on it. Boom. You’re a unicorn now.
5. **Kodecks** – Wildcard spelling, looks like a cyberpunk DJ but secretly writes unit tests.</div>
