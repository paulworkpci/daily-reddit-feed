Infiniti has nothing to offer anymore except for generic tarted up Nissan CVT slop, and Mitsubishi has one good car that I never see around and will likely end up meeting the same fate as the Suzuki Kizashi</div>

They don't need to be profitable, they just need to prove that they can be profitable eventually in the future, to be able to attract more investors that fund the temporary loss as they grow.</div>

Their long term goal with these big expensive models isn’t to provide a luxury service to consumers, it’s to outcompete white collar workers for their jobs. 
               
Don’t think of the price as “a huge subscription” think of it as “a very low salary”.

He kept saying ‘If Australians had guns, they wouldn’t be doing the lockdowns’. I’m Australian and it was a pure example of he not knowing who we are as a people and a culture. He kept repeating it like ‘guns’ were the answer to all. 
Australia’s cool. We’re chill. We have our crazies but so does every other place.</div>

Mean while this lightweight short fuck is on a ton of steroids and uses whatever his money can buy to look a certain way, like and old whore still slathering on makeup and using baby voice pretending to be 18 years old. It is always funny to me that the Tates and Rogans of the world clearly spend so much time on their appearance and dealing with their fear of getting older and dying. Very manly. Bunch of pussies. While an average working dad doesn't have time to spend 8 hours day on his body and looks, because he has a fucking family to take care off. Narcissistic fuck.

The cunt couldn't fix a hole in drywall to save his life. Drop this coward in the middle of Africa with a bow and arrow and we will see how much of a man he is.</div>

He only hangs out with comedians who kiss his ass, and only does interviews while being locked up in his guarded bunker podcast studio.

                                <div class="reply-body">You're correct about OP misstating it, but Amazon's revenue increased 10% YoY every year for the past 4 years (and going back over a decade) but headcount has actually fallen slightly over the past 4 years. Another 5 years of this and this could be true. (Assuming the revenue growth is retail and not services, which is probably wrong.)

Still though, they don't have to lay anyone off to have 75% of orders fulfilled by robots, not as long as sales are growing. And sales have a lot of room to grow, Amazon is only 40% of ecommerce sales, and ecommerce is only 20% of overall retail. Although Amazon just did surpass Walmart, so that's getting interesting.</div>

Replacing humans with machines is never sudden... it's slow. Amazon warehouses have had robots since the beginning. Guaranteed 100% of orders are 'touched' by robots, but it's only 75% automated from warehouse to delivery truck. And soon warehouse to your door, if you've seen the recent robot deliveries news.

We all know Amazon warehouse workers' horror stories of pissing in bottles, no AC in a &gt;100 degree (F) warehouse, etc. They have such a high turn-over rate, **they can simply NOT hire new warehouse employees.**

Amazon's growth is also insane, so maybe instead of hiring new people (who would end up as part of mass layoffs) they simply "hire" robots.

% of orders by robots is a number on spreadsheet for Amazon. It doesn't matter if management is fudging the numbers or cherry-picking based on their most automated warehouse. They will continue automating everything and not even turn a profit because they increase company spending to maintain an artificially low level of profits to avoid taxes.</div>

2. Amazon has a something like a 150% annual employee turnover rate. That means that each year on average *everybody* quits or is fired, a new crop of staff are hired, half of them quit or get fired *again*, and are then rehired. Every year. You wouldn’t hear about massive layoffs because *nobody wants to work there anyway*.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is highly misleading, but the bigger point still stands. We're in the final stretch of human replacement for a large share of the total workforce. Probably 3-5 year window (probably less) where most jobs are affected.

[My friend at Workday got fired with 1750 coworkers](https://www.reuters.com/business/workday-cut-85-its-workforce-2025-02-05/) with a brief email saying you've been replaced by AI. They literally mentioned AI in the layoffs. You can google this.

Regarding the OP claim, it's a big exaggeration for now. The real stat is the following as reported by [Yahoo Finance](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-amzn-target-lifted-248-172636396.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANHY-f1RzQIGrROQHuLvvJ1OTtX90ll_TWi2JJXU9aSViII2ZiWG0FF2Ue-TXpaVnB3xTSUeodnczAbIV2AfCYR7xDgM01q6ESjOZgGIDXRKpnCOEV5oDeTTwODxSlTZ0JdGWmN_GO_zFy8XNUZ0645XKvXNgdzOZ1Mg7KEs3kPA):

"Amazon now uses more than 750,000 robots, which assist with roughly 75% of customer orders".

That is obviously not the same as 75% orders fulfilled by Robots. Most of the orders are handled by both robots and humans.

However, I would personally (opinion) give it 2 years for this to be true, especially in the case of trailblazers like Amazon.</div>

Amazon basically isn't laying people off. What they are doing is growing revenue while keeping headcount basically flat. Most of the companies actually using AI, that's what it's going to look like. 10% revenue growth with 1-2% layoffs. If they were doing significant layoffs they wouldn't be able to sustain their revenue. The places laying off 10% of their employees are doing it because any revenue those employees were driving is at least a year off so they can do it with zero impact to their quarterly balance sheets.</div>

Sonnet was perfectly happy writing endless volumes of code. I still find Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro to be far better for code than OpenAI. I still use OpenAI for some stuff, but its coding quality is still below Sonnet, from what I can tell.</div>

at first i didn’t know what to do with it but [theadvault.co.uk](https://theadvault.co.uk) (free) kinda opened my eyes to some of the potential. i feel like people aren’t using it as a collaborator, they just think it’s supposed to do all their work for them

It helped me realize that some deals aren’t really deals at all the "discounted" price is often the regular price dressed up. Anyone else doing something similar?

I also like how he had to stop himself at the end since he’s just so deep in that headspace of understanding what’s coming. Man I wish we could hear Ilya speak more because speaking with such certainty is a rarity in this field even though anyone who really understands the pace of AI progress knows everything he’s saying is 100% true</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hi, I wanted to share this as inspiration and maybe it could help someone. I percieve anxiety as a swamp, if you can catch it early you are fine, but the deeper you go into the swamp, the harder it is to come back.. I will explain

I suffered with anxiety for years, for the past 3 years as my business wasnt performing well it got way worse, to the point my whole body was attacking me. I tried pills but I felt its not a cure, it was just pushing down things in me, so I decided to go on a journey ...</div>

I'm half way through The mind illuminated too. Been trying to catch my thoughts before it leads to anxiety; as well as analysing thoughts during anxiety but progress has been slow. What's the connection with showering your anus though?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body"># I like to experiment a lot with stuff.. when you are 100% overthinking showering your anus with cold water will cool you down instantly.. This is what chatgpt told me:

# 1. Stimulates the vagus nerve

* The vagus nerve runs close to the **anus and pelvic floor**.
* **Cold water** stimulates this nerve, activating the **parasympathetic nervous system** ("rest and digest" mode), which helps **calm the body and reduce anxiety**.
* This is similar to splashing cold water on the face or using cold on the neck (also vagus zones).

# 2. Interrupts overthinking by strong sensory input

* Sudden cold to the sensitive area causes a **sharp physical focus**—you’re pulled out of your head and into your body.
* This can **break rumination or racing thoughts**, anchoring you in the present.

# 3. Improves blood flow to pelvic organs

* The brief cold exposure triggers vasoconstriction followed by vasodilation.
* This can **reduce pelvic tension**, which is often **somatically linked to anxiety** and trauma storage (especially in chronic stress or freeze states).</div>

Quite literally, I think they’re trying to go Meta before anyone else. If they pull it off, though, closing the gap will become increasingly difficult.

But yeah, Zuck officially stated they’re using AI internally. Seems like they gave up on competing with consumer models (or never even started, since llama was OSS to begin with).</div>

They have a decent amount of data, a lot of compute, and shit can change quick. 

Remember pre what was it, llama 3.2 or 3.2 their models were basically garbage. Sure they got used for open source because they were the best open source at the time but still garbage. Then 3.3 dropped and it was close to SOTA. 

Remember when Google was dropping shitty model after shitty model? Now it’s basically blasphemy if you don’t say Google can’t be beat in this sub and elsewhere on reddit.

Before you get mad at me and drop your downvote bombs on my head, please think about this.

Why is it now so cool to hate on Israel?

The Israel hate is being pushed heavy right now. 

Whenever I'm supposed to hate somebody, I think, why? Who benefits?

No, I'm not Israeli (or Jewish for that matter) and I've never even been to Israel.

I don't know if they would let me in. I don't believe in muh six millions, for one thing.

But I refuse to hate anybody or anything just because other people tell me I should.

                        <div class="comment-body">Obviously, Gemini is still 2x cheaper than o3 and slightly better now, but you can see the trend, can't you? Gemini is becoming more and more expensive. They used to be like 10x+ cheaper than the competition for the same level of competitiveness. Now, yes, their models are SOTA and they're still *relatively* cheap, but if the trend continues, they might just converge in the middle.</div>

Doubling that accuracy won't just cost $1200; it could easily push the price into the tens of thousands, as the engineering and materials needed for those marginal gains become exponentially more expensive. 

So Gemini being better than O3 and still 2x cheap is hell of an amazing feat.</div>

Currently, when I’m working (writing code) I use GitHub copilot. The best model that works for most tasks so far is Gemini 2.5 pro. All other models still work great and some even perform better at different tasks so if I prompt a model more than twice and it does not seem to work, I undo and retry with a different model. Of course I still have to check to make sure that the outputted code actually works the...</div>

Thanks for feedback. For transparency we are getting additional Gemini capacity this week, and I expect the gemini experience to get drastically better in the next 7 days.

                        <div class="comment-body">ive designed a workflow for development to manage multiple agents at a time, sharing the overall project workload into smaller actionable tasks that Copilot (or any AI Assistant) can manage swiftly.

Ive also designed a handover process that is useful when a chat session is reaching its context window limit and hallucinations start to appear. You start in a new chat session with a fresh context window right where you left off with the previous agent
