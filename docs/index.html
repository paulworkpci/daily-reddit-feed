The only thing slowing down animal rights progress and lab grown meat adoption is tradition.

I suspect it will be the same for AI's, while some people will create AI sanctuaries for them to express their suffering. Other's will simply dismiss their suffering because "they dont have souls" or that "they are non-biological."</div>

Looming threat of tarrifs clearly is being used to force quick action, Canada announced these meassures because of threat of tarrifs back in december, and obviously 30day delay on them now is basically continuisly threatening leaders of both nations to act on what they outlined. I mean this is literally what Trump publicly listed as his prime negotiation tactic before election even, and how he plans to force action and agreements with outside countries using it.

But nah reddit it's always the same, black and white.</div>

Threatening your allies is not good in the long run. Relations will be severely impacted. If this is how US acts towards its closest allies (Canada) and most important trade partners (Canada, Mexico, china), it sends a strong message that America is not to be relied on and leaders of other countries will not forget. And If they have a choice, they will reliance on America in any way they can. 

So the way I see it Trump sacrificed helluva lot of power projection (because he caved in without demanding anything on top of what was already agreed before), prestige and reliability for nothing. This 30 day deadline or whatever it is now carries no meaning too, since everyone now knows that Trump doesn't want the smoke.

I'd be surprised if we even hear about the 30 day deadline from the Trump camp anymore, they will probably just let it fade away and have Elon Musk do something even more ridiculous than meddling with the treasury/Roman salute to draw the attention away</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This reminds me a lot of *Atomic Habits* by James Clear. He talks about how small, consistent actions compound over time, kind of like what you’re saying about momentum over perfection.

One of my biggest takeaways from the book is the idea of identity-based habits. Instead of just trying to "go to the gym," you start seeing yourself as someone who works out regularly. Once that identity shift happens, the habit feels less like an effort and more like just *who you are.*

For me, reading has become that effortless habit. I used to struggle to sit down and read consistently, but after making it a daily thing even just 10 minutes at first, it became automatic. Now, I actually want to read every day, it doesn’t feel like a task anymore.</div>

I'm sure most folks here are familiar with "Bullshit Jobs" - if you haven't read it, you're missing out on understanding a fundamental aspect of the modern economy. 

Most people's work consists of navigating some vaguely bureaucratic, political nonsense. They're making slideshows that explain nothing to leaders who understand nothing so they can fake progress towards fudged targets that represent nothin...</div>

But, in reality, that change I already here imo, I am a person have increased my productivity around 50x in the last 90 days, while there are some people who don't even know what AI does. 

The distribution of the curve is just widening so far as we speak, where the folks who are and have access to AI are just going to leap so far in next year or two, there won't be a way to bridge the gap. 

I feel some sense of discomfort and pain knowing that there are people who will be affected by this through no action of their own. 
But I read somewhere a whole back, "No action is worse than wrong action" atleast the wrong action teaches you something. 

But yea, just my mini thought dump.</div>

Lots of people like that think that they're invincible and they have low empathy for others who couldn't do what they did. Being screwed over by something outside their control could lead to a better society eventually. Speaking as someone who suddenly became disabled, society has treated me like utter dirt for something that I didn't ask to happen. So if they realize how broken things are, it hopefully will lead to change for everyone.

Of course it would be best if society sees the writing on the wall and enacts change *before* the mass suffering, but it seems like history never works out that way</div>

Mind you arithmetic actually help with your cognitive abilities that is outside math - ability to carry stuff over and multiply allows your mind to imagine abstract scenarios to expand your analytical/logical thinking as well as problem solving skills outside math. In terms of just brain health, it will reduce or slow down mental deterioration as you age.</div>

Like there’s not much reason to think that doing mental math helps abstract reasoning than playing a video game where you need to remember maps. Or participate in any sort of building project where you have to plan things out and then execute. Or write a paper.

Like yeah, holding stuff in your head is important, I just don’t think it’s obvious that arithmetic is exceptionally equipped to build that muscle. You can just… do the types of things that you will need to be using that skill for in the future, directly. Which is probably more efficient.

I don’t even think mental arithmetic is that important for developing a good working understanding of numbers, tbh. Some of the best academic mathematicians and physicists were notoriously bad at it.</div>

Also using a calculator is fine but it's also been shown that students who first learn without it tend to develop better math skills and understanding than those who start with it. 

To me with AI I think we will get to the point where if the internet goes down people are going to become completely inept.</div>

Incidentally, the DOE may be the agency that finally stands up to Trump. Educators are highly organized on the national level and they are not going down without a fight. Trump does not have the Constitutional authority to shut down the DOE. He will still try, of course, but teachers may well be the first to call a national strike.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Many teachers are unable to do much because their state policies and educator laws state that such actions result in termination of state certification. All by design of course.

Edit due too many replies - 

I want to believe most of these comments do not work in education and are therefore not knowing how things are on the ground in many places already - they are already firing us. And replacing us with uncertified, paid hourly paraprofessionals or long-term subs, who hold no certifications and are unqualified but who also cost a fraction of the salary. They are "facilitators" of the curriculum in these instances and it's all by design to vilify teachers as unnecessary and horrible for demanding either fair compensation or for in this case standing up to a dismantling of the DOE. 

The theater is the point. The firings and replacement is already underway and a huge strike and push for the end is what they want so privatized education - with those systems ready and waiting to attempt to fill the gaps - will ride in to "save America from the evils of the socialist public education sphere." 

It may take some time but if they are the only ones available as many have said parents will turn to them. And that will signal the end, after a generation is indoctrinated under private, conservative values Moral Majority education, they won't need to enact draconian legislative measures anymore - they will be shouted for by the people themselves.</div>

Ss: that thing was super fast and appeared out of nowhere it changed directions before I started filming. It's was super bright when It moved and not so bright when it was still. I don't know how many character that was so I am adding a few more for the bots. But that was absolutely incredible. Still shocked to be honest. But yeah I guess they are real. Showed to a few people but they didn't believe me that it is in fact a ufo. But damn no plane moves this fast it was also super far away like a star. What an experience!

                                <div class="reply-body">“Drone” doesn’t explain anything. The supposed drones have been recorded changing shapes and not a single person has been identified as being associated with the objects. We might as well say it’s “rabbit balls” because at least we know what that means and it’s a real thing that we can locate. “Drones”allow for it to be identified without identifying anything.</div>

It's was super bright when It moved and not so bright when it was still. I don't know how many character that was so I am adding a few more for the bots. But that was absolutely incredible. Still shocked to be honest. But yeah I guess they are real. Showed to a few people but they didn't believe me that it is in fact a ufo. But damn no plane moves this fast it was also super far away like a star. What an experience!</div>

                <div class="post-content">I feel like I'm living in a post-covid dystopian nightmare. I drag myself to my job, then drag myself home. The town I live in is always completely empty. Restaurants, bars, all shut down (except for tourists on weekends). And everyone I know just isolates at home with their digital media. It wasn't like this before Covid. Now everything seems like an empty, depressing wasteland. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Depends where you are.  But I agree.  Covid plus political hysteria on both sides has made it difficult to go out alone and meet people.  I see tons of people out and about, but it does feel like people are more locked in their bubble now. I've noticed this with people who work from home and still don't do anything outside of their home. Best thing to do is try to find hobbyist groups and that isn't hollow advice, I think Covid gave people a time to develop hobbies instead of just socializing.  I feel like socializing for sake of socializing is lame now and doing something constructive or interest-based is the new thing.</div>

Here’s how: After reading a chapter or article, explain the key points as if you're teaching it to a 10-year-old. No fancy jargon, just simple words. If you struggle to break it down, that means you don’t fully understand it yet. Reread the tricky parts, then try again.

On my worst days I go on my phone. I know that going on my phone sets the wrong tone for the morning and gets me stuck. I try to avoid it but pobody’s nerfect.</div>

The 22m project vastly over performed compared to the one that got too much money. Scarcity meant no PowerPoint, no scrum masters, no coaches, no consultants, no frills, no slackers. If someone wasn't pulling their weight, they immediately got moved off.

Scarcity is an incredibly important part of innovation.</div>

Effectively you’ve started with the outcome you wanted to see (women have more money than men and are going to invest more ethically than men) and then asked for sources to back this up in a seemingly academic blog. But really, the research was done the wrong way around.

I’m not shitting on you mind, because I don’t know the full context of your own expertise and independent knowledge, but this just triggered the realisation for me that even seemingly benign research tools could be used to spew out propaganda.

At the end of the line, if I’d read your article versus an article with the opposite conclusions, I as a human am no longer capable to identify truth from falsehood. Worse, my own bubble could lead me to favour one truth over another.</div>

I did however omit a bunch of dialogue with Deep Research in finalising my piece just because writing this particular review inspired some laziness in me and I couldn't be bothered including every subsequent request/addition. 

Toward reaching the outcome I did, I did include questions to find counterpoints or socio-economic trends that would conflict with this outcome. 

But in the case of this particular blog, I was already aware of a sufficient degree of data to know that this was the case in terms economic/financial trends.   
So I am somewhat guilty of mostly looking for a broader expression of that data across investment spectrums. 

But to you're point, depending on how a user questions it, I can definitely see that risk.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">in the end, most truths cannot be known beforehand anyway.  simple truths, yes. like, good is better than evil. everyone knows this is an objective truth.

but something like "women will invest more ethically than men" is something that cannot be known. you aren't trying to determine if this is true or not.  it is a theory. it must be tested to become truth. and even then, it isn't necessarily true. it was just true (if it pans out) for this planet with this population this time.

so it does not really matter if it is 'propaganda'.  if it is a sound idea and you like it, and support the idea, you may pursue it or write it into your database (memory) as a positive idea and one you might enjoy discussing with others to spread the idea around.

propaganda does not automatically have to be wrong, bad or evil.  it just typically has that association because many governments use it very poorly.   "x" is bad don't trust 'x' without giving you all the details of exactly what 'x' is or what 'x' is doing in reality.

in this scenario, it sounds like an interesting proposal and i am inclined to think it would be a good thing if it were to turn out that way. women in general i find to be less easy to corrupt than men. they tend to be a bit more on the nurturing/caring side of the spectrum and most likely would invest in things that would keep us healthier/safer in general.  makes sense to me.  it might not work out that way but if i were in some dumb scenario where i had to choose a predominantly male or predominantly female presence in the investing scene, i would absolutely pick female.

now, obviously, the best answer is to have a roughly equal presence because we are wired differently, and we see things that ARE important differently. you can't ignore one and give everything to the other and expect balance. its not. it will never be.</div>

Its giving you access to proper PhD student quality research papers in like 30 minutes about anything you want and on the pro tier you get 100 uses per month which means you get over 3 research papers written for you every single day in a 31 day month and then some and this is coming to plus users and even free users albeit with a slightly dumber but still very powerful model soon</div>

I am not questioning the capability, but the mere limitation that it does not have access of any of the main publishers resources makes it inherently useless for research (at least in my field). It might differ in Fields that favor open access.

If it combines browser functionality, so I could log into my accounts so it would be able to access publishers, this would greatly enhance it from business research to actual scientific research.</div>

On the other hand, once someone releases a free, open source model that can take photos of a real person and turn those photos into a realistic 3d model of the person and then pose them / create renderings, OF models are gonna be in trouble. 

Basically something like Daz3d "face scan" except also body scan, and also.. actually good (daz3d face scan sucks), and free / open source.

Could be a long time but it will happen.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">All the previous video models were novelties.  You kinda just have to take what it gives you.  So there was no way that they would be useful in a real production environment where you need very *specific* performances, not some random thing.  Now that you can use a video to guide the AI generation you can actually make art directed videos.  With this you can actually replace actors, set designers ect without sacrificing directability.

This model and the ones to follow is where the entertainment industry and VFX jobs will seriously be affected.

More than 2 years they promised they will deliver source code they still gave NOTHING! I was there waiting since day one. We don't trust ByteDance and their lies of promises to release source code anymore. What a load of bs
