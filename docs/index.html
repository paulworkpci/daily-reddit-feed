You might be thinking to yourself, if I get trained first then I get beat this influx of people and be their boss/teacher. This is where your thinking will fail you.

Pretty much all critical thinking has been removed from the vast majority of construction. 3...</div>

100% correct. 

I used to do freelance translating on the side. About 10 years ago, there was a very noticeable shift in offers from translation to QC, as in “Hey we don’t need you to translate this text, we just need you to polish this translation we got from google translate!”

Naturally it only paid 60% of the translation rate because “it’s way easier and less time consuming to do”, which was BS because the quality of google translate at the time was dog shit. It actually took me longer to fix the bad translations than to just translate from scratch. I stopped doing it because it simply wasn’t worth my time. 

Fast forward to today, and rates have collapsed to the point where only the most desperate people would accept. In 2-3 years, a majority of translation work will probably be done fully by AI with minimal to no checks from humans. The quality is not as good as that of a skilled human, but it is “good enough”. The industry is all but dead.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The post-labor economy is coming, the only question is how fast. 

It will only take 10% permanent (structural) unemployment to trigger a recession. At 15-20% you are looking at a full-blown depression. And it only gets worse from there as more and more labor is substituted with each year. But wait, if we are unemployed - who will be able afford all the wonderful stuff AI and robots do for us? 

What is required is a complete rethinking of income, its distribution, and how to clear liquidity from an economy when the historic constraints of humans trading in skills/lifespan for income no longer apply. That world is going away. 

There are upsides and downsides obviously, and we can freak out or embrace it. I choose to look for the opportunities and aim not just to survive, but to thrive.</div>

Ah, this is what makes AGI/ASI scary. It fully replace human. 

The rich is quite comfy in their lifestyle but they know they depends on a huge educated underclass for the lifestyle improvement they want. They may want to take a stroll one day on Mars for 250th birthday thank to their life extending drug. It's not something the rich can achieve alone. 

With ASI, they can.</div>

As an electrician, even if i had ai glasses responding to my thoughts, it would be of no use to me except for doing calculations while I was bending pipe, and at that point you've replaced a calculator with AI glasses. Maybe referring the code book will be easier with AI, not much else. Really the augmented reality of labeling wires and pipes virtually are more intriguing then having AI available to me.  Advanced robotic arms that can reach impossible positions is more of a game changer then AI

Almost all trades are less about book knowledge and more about experience and capabilities.  Shove an electrical engineer in someone's attic and see how fast they can rewire something vs an electrician.</div>

I have a lot a lot of issues with the 4o parasocial folks, but when the GPT5 model router is routing people to mini models for questions which used to be handled by larger models, or low reasoning effort models when medium used to be the standard, its rightfully frustrating. 

GPT5-thinking-high is great. I would argue GPT o3 was far more capable than the version of GPT5 most people are getting routed to for 80% of requests though</div>

Their "tests" boil down to shit like "come up with new physics", "solve some unsolved mathematics", "write a story", "come up with a new business idea".

It's like those classic "I have an idea for an app" people but the idea has no substance beyond "I want to make money".</div>

I'm going to explain a scam which steals at least $100B from advertisers every year. The ad networks like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and LinkedIn make minimal effort to stop it since they earn so much money from it. They know any future fine for participating in the fraud will be minuscule compared to the hundreds of billions they're earning from it. 

Before I explain the fraud (known as "click fraud"), let me give a quick introduction on who I am: ...</div>

They essentially started developing it due to premature births and it was originally meant to help these children develop, but over the years they've advanced the technology so much that Japan was very close to having a completely artificial womb only a few years ago, so the technology is there. 

Whether or not this humanoid robot is the real deal, that remains to be seen, but it's certainly interesting.</div>

"The Chinese science and technology media outlet Kuai Ke Zhi reported on the 8th an interview with Zhang Qifeng, a PhD at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, who is developing the pregnancy robot. The pregnancy robot he envisions is not an incubator but a humanoid, with a womb in its abdomen that can replicate the entire process from conception to delivery.

The key to the pregnancy robot is the "artificial womb" technology, where the fetus grows inside the artificial womb filled with artificial amniotic fluid and receives nutrients through a hose.

These aren't clickbait creepypasta or obvious fiction. They are produced like legitimate local news reports. Their about me pages are unclear and their comments sections are curated.

For example, the channel: Nest Stories

                        <div class="comment-body">There's this phenomena here, too. But mostly through controversial topics involving real life figures, sometimes touching onto sensitive topics like politics.

They pick a event that occurred in real life and create a lore parallel to this event. For exemple, "a TV show host accused of treating their employees poorly". That's a fact, but then, they create an event, like I said, parallel to it. "A TV show host accused of treating their employees poorly... *because he was under substances while working*"

If you're used to consuming content on the internet, you'd probably tell EASILY that's fake. However, the comments are FLOOOOOODED with older people believing the situation was real.</div>

I just watched a charming animal documentary from a small creator. The narration was 100% AI (and probably the script too). Does it matter? No. It pulled in millions of views and likes. This is only the beginning of the AI era.</div>

Take a picture of anything you want to know how its different in the future.

Hell Id even go so far as to say you can take a picture of your child so you'll be able to look back and see how they looked yrs ago.

Another LPT - make a note of what date the picture is from so you know the date it was taken!


A super LPT - pro tips are more than basic sense. Like a  true LPT would be to learn signs of infection, take a body temp regularly and take a course on wound cleaning. A picture is worth a thousand words but those words dont matter if you haven't educated yourself on what to do.

All files that has been "processed" during cut operation, have essentialy been removed from the original location, and undoing the cut implies that you don't want your files to populate target anymore either.

2. A photorealistic still life of a bowl of fresh, colorful fruit on a white marble countertop. The lighting is bright and clean, with subtle reflections and shadows on the surface.

Other little details: For the eye the city is at night but the reflection hints at a clear sky. For the Tokyo street there are inconsistencies between the direction of the traffic flow, the arrows on the street and the motion blur of the cars, for the coffee and croissant why 2 spoons?


You get the idea, but for the other pictures really hard to say though.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Generally the way it works this:

Frontier lab produces a leading model. 

Chinese labs use those leading models to generate high quality training datasets. They invent and use novel and unique techniques, algorithms and optimizations to eke out a new model trained on those high quality datasets. Publish paper on said techniques. Release model for open source community and gain fame and fortune or use the highest quality version of the model for a web app where they profit. 

It’s a solid cycle of innovation. There is a reason why why Qwen image and Wan2.2 have ChatGPT-like yellow tints in their outputs.</div>

EDIT: Tried it out some image edits in lmarena, output does seem fluxish in terms of style but there's a very noticeable improvement in quality of finer details that flux often krangles, speed is fast which would indicate flux too (openai image gen takes 5x as long). 

Exciting, whatever it is I hope it's not some "ultra plus max" API that costs 20 cents per image.</div>

This summer he built a “Find My Phone” style safety app for kids. One tap sends location to trusted contacts, and kids can trigger a silent distress signal via Google Assistant using code phrases. He used AI minimally to check and refactor code, always with guidance, and completed the project entirely on his own.

everything about this - including that letter ("AI has no place in my classroom *or any other classroom*") - reveals bias.

are the students allowed to use computers? calculators? the internet? those faced backlash when they emerged in the past as well.

is the student allowed to come to school in a car or is that cheating, since every kid should walk?

incidentally, this happened to a friend of mine at college.

a teacher accused him of plagiarism based solely on an excellent piece of work he turned in.

the teacher didn't believe it was his... because it was so good!

he proved it was original and wound up winning a college-wise prize for it at the end of the year (Ivy League school).

OP -

I would write the teacher back thanking them for the note, and assuring them you took their advice to "discuss the matter with your son," which gave you an opportunity to explain to him how proud you were for his accomplishment, and to keep up the good work!</div>

I build nights and weekends and will have 300 hours into it when done. So not a huge savings when considering time but our productivity will increase. 

I peppered LLM features all over it and it’s going to help us onboard juniors WAY faster.</div>

And you can save out features like authentication and reuse for other projects. Of course, after the authentication part has been proven to be bulletproof. Modular design is the best design? My apologies.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There is logic in language. It doesn't have to "think" to come up with it's responses. It is just guessing, but, it's so good at it that if we ask the right question in the right way it makes connections, through language, that allow it to give these kind of responses. And thats not a bug, it's a feature. What it is now is extremely powerful. As is its probably the greatest invention ever. We have just started to learn how to use it. I think people overlook that when comparing to agi or asi. I'm sure it knew what the test would produce because it has learned from all the other tests and applied those results. Humans are where we are because we can build off what others have learned. This takes all that learning and "learns" it. The breath of knowledge, retention, and accessibility is not something any 1 or 100 or 1000000 people could do. At this point, as it's showing and doing, it is capable of changing the world. We just have to ask the right questions. The people saying it's predicting text are right, they just dont understand how powerful that really is</div>

Look: I get it, a capitalist company needs a healthy balance sheet. But OpenAI’s marketing pretends that it is not. And this is the underlying pattern in Silicon Valley; grandiose visions of a Utopian future but “It was capitalism after all” (Kara Swisher quote)</div>

"Cutting costs" is often said with a negative connotation, but as you said, getting more intelligence at a lower cost can never not be a great thing.</div>

But it wasn't even remotely that. It was just a clever update that cut costs and was efficient. It's not the best model. It's not the smartest. And I think it seems a bit desperate to be going so hard on hyping it when they knew it wasn't even state of the art.</div>
