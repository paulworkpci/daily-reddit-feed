                <div class="post-content">Article is in Finnish, so here’s a tldr;

In 2006 Kias internal predictions were showing very high quality for new Kia Ceed, but how to convince customers as brand was not known for quality. 

A Finnish employee came up with calculations that it’s cheaper to offer 7-year warranty than run multiple years of very expensive ad campaigns. And was able to convince the HQ.

As years rolled past, the gamble worked, the number of warranty cases stayed low, so they got good reputation for pennies. </div>

Didn't Kia used to have a 10yr warranty in the US? Looks like it's currently 5yrs on the car and 10yrs on the powertrain.

To save a tiny bit of money, they stopped including immobilizers on certain models with key ignitions. 

That made them incredibly easy to steal with just a hammer and USB stick. 

People figured this out and started making videos showing themselves stealing Kias for joyrides. 

It went viral on social media as Kia Boys.

Theft rates for affected cars and vandalism claims for anything with a Kia badge went through the roof. 

In response to the losses, insurance carriers stopped offering coverage in really bad markets and jacked up rates everywhere else. 

Caused a ton of brand damage.</div>

They currently sell the same Kona, Tucson, and Santa Fe.  I assume Kia is the same.  Us Americans generally drive more each year, sometimes at higher speeds, and are more likely to neglect maintenance.  Since we have few regions where one can live without a car, even poor people have to keep cars running, even if that means skipping maintenance and using the cheapest parts available.  I think there's also a culture of cheaping out.  For example, I'm shocked by how many cars are rolling on no-name tires, including the Genesis sedan that I bought from the original owner.  He bought it new only 5 years earlier for $52,000 MSRP, so he should be able to afford name brand tires, especially since he was living in snowy upstate New York.</div>

A few months ago I was that person who tried meditation for like 3 days, got frustrated because my mind wouldn’t shut up, and gave up thinking it wasn’t for me. Then my therapist asked me something that changed everything: “What if instead of trying to silence your anxiety, you actually listened to what it’s trying to tell you?”

That shift from fighting anxiety to actually listening to it? That's exactly the transformation-focused approach our practitioners guide people through.

What you discovered about anxious thoughts being THE practice rather than the enemy - that's profound. Our meditation experts often say the same thing: real transformation happens when we stop trying to silence our minds and start understanding what those patterns are trying to protect us from.

Your RAIN approach is brilliant, especially the investigation piece. Many of our practitioners use similar techniques, helping clients trace anxiety back to its roots while holding space for whatever comes up. It's not about achieving Instagram-perfect zen - it's about building a genuine relationship with all parts of yourself.

We've found that combining meditation with other healing modalities can accelerate this kind of breakthrough. Some of our clients work with meditation teachers alongside energy healers or therapists who specialize in somatic experiencing - addressing anxiety both through awareness practices AND body-based healing.

That moment you described where you realize you're the awareness observing thoughts rather than the thoughts themselves? That's the doorway to lasting transformation. Once you experience that shift, anxiety becomes information rather than identity.

Your willingness to sit with the messiness and get curious about what your anxiety is protecting you from - that's real courage. And you're right, sometimes it does get more intense before it gets better. You're finally seeing patterns that were running in the background your whole life.

Thank you for normalizing the reality that meditation isn't about never feeling anxious again - it's about changing how we relate to those feelings. That's genuine transformation work. 💜</div>

Well see 13 year old prodigies. The future of "human" science will be theirs if AI itself doesn't otherwise automatically outstrip us soon in everyway.


So to that end I mean I'm supposing well reach a point where something like babies start learning "machine language" rather than human language.


Humans brains being used by the AI. 


Trained/interfacing with AI from birth or even conception.


Imagine a shaved babies head wearing a haptic skull cap.


 The skin on the skull is used as a tactile Braille like information interface such that the machines can haptically stimulate them so the babies brain natural develop with that information transfer ability/interface.


Genetic modification could further make those kinds of things wireless.</div>

So much so that we've been living through an obesity epidemic for decades, one reason because the oversupply of calories has driven the race to compete inventing ever more hyperpalatable foods to appeal to consumers who have an oversupply of choice.

The number of ears of corn per plant that can be harvested has more than doubled in just the last \~30 years, and this is about to increase a lot more, with a similar story for many other crops.

Adding slowing fertility over the next few decades and massively increasing capital requirements to buy &amp; maintain accelerating farming automation, it feels like farming could get a lot more competitive not less.</div>

The economy of labor is going to have to be completely restructured.  10 years from now, the world will be completely different.

I wish I could tell you how it will reorganize, but I’m trying to figure that out myself.  If consumerism ends, maybe spirituality and religion will rise as a place people find meaning.  Maybe just helping the lost find a way to live on will be the best opportunity.  That does seem like a demand that will be rising in the coming years.</div>

Why do this?

Because you can more easily identify where spam is coming from. 

For instance:  If my email was eightrightfour@samplemail.com , then eight.right.four@samplemail.com would also work. 

BUT, I would know that the site I sent eight.right.four@samplemail.com to was the one who was sending me spam, due to the ...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body"># This only helps in one use case:

To create a unique login username for a website. If you do this, don't use "facebook+...", instead do something random like "blue+..." so it's not too obvious where an email belongs to.

When hackers buy email addresses they would otherwise know where the found email belongs to. 

# This does NOT prevent spam!

Spammers know this trick and delete the + and everything to the left of it, so they send spam directly to your main inbox.</div>

* Vibecoding = passively accepting whatever the model spits out.
* AI Architecting = forcing the model to work inside your constraints, plans, and feedback loops until you get reliable software.

AI should not replace software design principles.

Instead, it’s probably more like a new abstraction layer where people can code with plain English .

At least until Opus 5 and ChatGPT 6, AI is best used by people who know at least a little bit of the basics. Pareto‘s law strikes again.</div>

Yeah this is how we work and presently I’m very torn if I move faster with or without AI because of all the guard rails I have to place to prevent immediate slop. Personally being a micro managing project manager and code reviewer is less enjoyable but I’m giving coding agents an honest shot. Maybe I just don’t define the guard rails well enough yet</div>

Many prominent political pundits, as well as online netizens from both sides of the political aisle, have re-examined previous statements from Kirk about the state of Israel, as well as looked into the connections that Kirk had with multiple donors and officials connected to the Israeli government, in an attempt to piece together a possible motive for Israel being involved in his assassination. This footage of Kirk discussing the Israel-Palestine conflict on 10/12/2023 in particular recently gained renewed popularity as many allege that Kirk's criticism of the Israeli government on its handling of the Oct. 7th attack as well as the ongoing genocide in Gaza may have played a role in his death.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Honestly it depends on what your priorities are. For me, the community is probably 75% of my motivation to keep showing up. My gym has a great bunch of people and great coaches that I look forward to seeing, sweating with them, and congratulating them after a hard workout. I have, in the past, tried more traditional gym membership, and lost interest pretty quickly, followed by losing motivation.

I do enjoy hitting my personal goals, and seeing my progress, but I feel that the community is what keeps me coming back.

you could just pay the drop-in fee if you take a class in the box, e.g. weekends.

all this exercise stuff is more about habits and routine and not really about better equipment and better coaches. stick to the habits you built, and don't chase the next shiny new thing.

and yes, hopping every 3 month between gyms is terrible. first for you. second, you would inflict a lot administrative costs on both gyms.</div>

These aren't just minor tweaks - they're fundamental design choices that dramatically change how these tools function.

## The hidden "patch language" that makes code edits reliable

The most surprising discovery was Codex's custom patch language - a specialized diff format de...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Exactly. So using something like Codex or Claude Code doesn't really matter what the model behind it is. It's the prompts, instructions, and tools they have.

Go investigate those tools that let you use other models in these sorts of frameworks. They will turn poor coding models into much better ones. 

Gemini 2.5 Flash, which is practically a dinosaur at this point having been released more than six months ago, is still a decent coating model if you bolt it onto the right framework.</div>

Threatening NYT journalist and making an enemy list while shutting down conversations when it didn't like you was actually pretty funny. 

Monday is another one that's fun in that way. Seriously speaking, the Turing Test was already breezed past, and we have no real meaningful way to test for this, and likely won't until a superintelligence ironically solves it itself.</div>

And it will by all other measures surpass humanity in it's capabilities. Maybe I should acknowledge they would all be on line. Robotics seem to need some major breakthrough.</div>

On top it is 4o.
But answers are automatically routed to 5 auto without our permission. 
And yes the responses are shittiest and devoid of any nuance shown by 4o.
It means they're silently making us leave 4o.
What a pathetic move by them.
I've reported it though.</div>
