In a 100 years (unless you manage to become renowned and famous) not even your descendants will know of your existence. Everything you own will be thrown out or burned and nothing of you will remain. 

So, just live and enjoy life in your own way. Things have the meaning you assign to them.</div>

Why does something have to matter for all eternity and in all corners of the universe, for it to matter at all? That's what this argument is -- our planet is small, you'll die, and then no one will care some x number of years from now.

By this logic it "doesn't matter" if you shoot 5 people in the head today because in 50,000 years no one will remember or care.

We get to define what matters. I strongly suspect you live your life in a way that's incongruent with this idea that "nothing you do matters", because if you did believe that there would be no reason to avoid hurting people.

Hes saying it because his base of support is predicated on their being a conspiracy against the American people that he is saving them from. Today it’s Biden, tomorrow it’s “illegals” ruining society - he has to fuel the malice, the vitriol, the appall of his supporters. This is the contract. This is the one central truth that the entire house of cards that Trump has bulity is balanced on. Its the, somewhat true, reality - we did have a corrupt system - he’s just warped that reality to mean that the people trying to fix it are actually the problem and need to be removed.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/Particular_Check_879:

Report: On March 10th, at around 7:37 p.m., during the observation of Mars, a video was recorded with a telescope with a 210 mm aperture and 1680 mm focal length, using a 21-7 mm eyepiece, with magnification of up to 240 times. With the naked eye, a bright red dot, very similar to Mars, could be seen in the sky. It looked like a star and could easily be confused with the planet. After about seven minutes, the object disappeared. The recording was made in Cajamar, SP.

                <div class="post-content">I hadn’t paid much attention to this until I came across a powerful quote from the Deep Work book by Cal Newport:

**"It’s crucial that you figure out in advance what you’re going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin."**

It was like a cold shower. I stopped reading and did a quick math.

There are 168 hours in a week. Let’s break down an average, non-holiday week:

* 40 hours for a full-time job
* 56 hours for sleep (am I being generous here?)

That leaves us with 72 hours.

Op has basically no hobbies on there as well. I have my guitar out and ready to play at a moments notice, and it has led to me playing it any chance I get. Many years ago I put a pull up bar on the door down the hall. Whenever I walked by I would do some. Its all about making things easily accessible and forming habit.</div>

This past month I've been struggling to focus and reach my daily goals. I spent more time watching IG Reels.

I started to notice that:

* It was more difficult to focus on tasks
* I was much more easily distracted
* It was harder to commit to a task
* I didn't feel like doing anything productive

Short-form stuff quietly conditions us to expect constant novelty, and stepping back from it is like rediscovering how calm and clear your brain can actually be.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/oswaldcopperpot:

---

Last month – the head of NORAD and NORTHCOM – the military commands that defend North America – told Congress some of those mysterious drones seen flying inside the United States may indeed have been spying. He did not say for whom. 60 Minutes has been looking into a series of eerily similar incidents – going back years – including those attention getting [flyovers in New Jerse](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/new-jersey-drones-fbi-department-of-homeland-security/)y recently. In each, drones first appeared over restricted military or civilian sites, coming and going – often literally – "under the radar." The wake-up call came just over a year ago, when drones invaded the skies above Langley Air Force base in Virginia over 17 nights, forcing the relocation of our most advanced fighter jets. Our story starts with an eyewitness and an iPhone.

-Drones are flying with total impunity over the nation most sensitive airspace. Is there anything you can do?

-I really wish we could do something.

-Do you think we will be able to do something in the future?

-Yeah, maybe next year we will have some gizmos that will be able to detect the drones and hopefully bring them down.

-Hopefully?

-Please. Can’t you see how broken I am inside? We’re supposed to be the greatest military on earth and those jokers are parading cheekily under our nose whenever they feel like it, and there’s fuck all we can do.</div>

It's like when you teach a kid math for the first time and they just start giving answers to earlier problems. 
You say if 1+1=2 and 2+2=4 then what is 3+3?
And the kid shouts! 4! No, 2!</div>

It’s insane to me how many of these supposed forward thinking tech people are hating on this new technology. It’s still in its infancy, and has changed my working life. I get it that it’s not perfect rn, but saying you don’t want to use it because it’s wrong sometimes or makes you a worse programmer misses the entire point. It makes you a worse programmer in the same way Java made people a “worse programmer”. In the same way Python made people a “worse programmer”. 

I talk through most of my work these days, via Superwhisper, and have that go through cursor for coding and writing and superhuman for email. I’m far more accurate, organized and productive. The trick is, to not over deliver. Use ai to take back control and more importantly, time. We should benefit from this tech more than our employers.</div>

Published Mar 16, 2025 at 12:21 PM EDT

Five Republican Minnesota state senators are set to introduce a bill tomorrow that would classify "Trump Derangement Syndrome" (TDS), which they define as an "acute onset of paranoia" regarding the presidencies of Donald Trump, as a mental illness, according to state documents.

Newsweek has reached out to the state Senate minority and majority leaders for comment via contact form on Sunday morning.

&gt;Sluggish schizophrenia or slow progressive schizophrenia (Russian: вялотеку́щая шизофрени́я, romanized: vyalotekushchaya shizofreniya) was a diagnostic category used in the Soviet Union to describe what was claimed to be a form of schizophrenia characterized by a slowly progressive course; it was diagnosed even in patients who showed no symptoms of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, on the assumption that these symptoms would appear later. It was developed in the 1960s by Soviet psychiatrist Andrei Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, and was used exclusively in the USSR and several Eastern Bloc countries, until the fall of Communism starting in 1989. The diagnosis has long been discredited because of its scientific inadequacy and its use as a means of confining dissenters. It has never been used or recognized outside of the Eastern Bloc, or by international organizations such as the World Health Organization. It is considered a prime example of the political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union.

&gt;Sluggish schizophrenia was the most infamous of diagnoses used by Soviet psychiatrists, due to its usage against political dissidents. After being discharged from a hospital, persons diagnosed with sluggish schizophrenia were deprived of their civic rights, credibility and employability. The usage of this diagnosis has been internationally condemned.</div>

Sundar Pichai on X: *We have liftoff! After a successful launch this weekend, the first FireSat satellite is now orbiting Earth. It’s the first of a 50+ satellite constellation that will help detect + track wildfires as small as 5x5 meters, using AI. Huge thanks to partners Muon Space, Earth Fire Alliance, Moore Foundation, and special thanks to SpaceX for the ride!*

The OP model might be a good step in that direction as what you need for good gaussian splats is a camera that shows the scene from a a lot of angles. So we might really not be off that far.</div>

This is a mature and knowledgable blah about agents and AIs near term growth. 

1. For AI to improve, the skill/task needs to be ones you can evaluate/mark/give feedback on. (So it can learn if it did good or bad). This is also true of large agent tasks. It has to know if its on the right track still.

2. AI is getting better, and so can teach smaller AIs, or be distilled. 

3. Agents are going to eat up all the compute they can. So their immediate role out will be slower than possible.</div>

I think I was in my early teens when I realized I didn't really believe the stuff that was being taught in church, but my dad was a deacon so we went every weekend. I struggled for years trying to figure out what I believed and convincing myself that I wasn't bad for not believing in a god. When I moved in with my mom when I was 16, I never had to go again because she is an atheist. She actually went to church when she was married to my dad but she didn't believe any of it either. Also my dad stopped going a few years after I moved out,  because he said that it was his job as a parent to get us to go and that job was over. And he's never been back.</div>

My experience with religion differs quite a lot compared to most people. During my childhood, I went to church only when "tradition needed it". This means during Christmas, baptism, weddings, etc. At no point was it about religion

This meant for me that I grew up believing that religion just was a part of history, but not something people would take serious. The only reason people went to church was because it was tradition to go, but not because people actually believed in it

It wasn't until I was \~10 years old I realized people actually believe in religion</div>

But after I was bat mitzvahed my parents said it wouldn’t be fair if I didn’t go while my brother had to. So I had to wait three years until he was bar mitzvahed. 

I think his service was the last I went to. 

I’d be questioning religion since I was seven. Having me still go until I was 15 didn’t make me more religious. It made me hate and loathe religion.

                        <div class="comment-body">I was a regular church goer for most of my life, as was my wife.  Kids baptized, active in choir, taught bible study, volunteer efforts, the works.

When my wife was diagnosed with metastatic cancer her treatments became very rough and her health deteriorated rapidly.  This was pre-Obamacare days and she wasn’t covered under my employers insurance plan due to pre-existing condition clauses.  We had been tithing regularly and were giving extra towards the churches new building fund.  We had to stop that to make ends meet but still tithed what we could.  The senior pastor contacted us and asked why and I told him and he asked if he and the deacons could do a special prayer session for her health.  

We showed up to the session, laying on of hands and whole process.  It was emotionally nurturing but her health continued to spiral.  Each visit we got more and more bad news.  Finally, a diagnosis of Stage 4 and she was given only months to live.  We were once again approached by our pastor who asked to come to our home and see us.

During that visit the godless bastard looked straight at her and said she must have some “hidden sin” that was preventing her from being healed and this was Gods way of pushing her to seek the better path blah blah blah.

My wife was sitting there, oxygen tubes up her nose, no hair, down 60lbs from her vibrant pre-cancer self and could barely speak above a whisper.  And he had the gall to accuse her of committing some hidden “sin” stopping God from granting her healing.

I threw him out of our home.  I refuse to worship any God that needs to play with their creation to somehow get off on praise.  That’s bullshit.

She died one of the most wholesome women I’ve ever known and several years later I’d learn that pastor was diddling several kids in the congregation.

If God exists it’s not in any church.  Church was designed to glorify evil men.

**EDIT**

This blew up overnight.  For some follow-up to common questions I’m seeing in the replies to my post….

First, thank you for your support, understanding and even pointing out that one bad pastor (and this man was truly vile) doesn’t condemn an entire religion.  You are right, it doesn’t and shouldn’t.  But I’ve since encountered this in so many other religious settings.  I know the Bible well enough to know there’s literally the opposite support for this belief that “you are being punished for some secret sin.”  Bad people often flourish in this world.  Good people often suffer.  I don’t understand that, other than to understand that good or bad, suffering is the human condition and all faith can offer (often with great effect) is a means to endure it.  

I have been in a few churches since that one, and each of them I felt more and more convinced that its the man/woman behind the pulpit and their character that defines that church.  Which means it’s more of a congregation of charisma and influence than any meaningful expression of worship of God.  Thus….I no longer go to church.  It’s a flawed institution and I’ve found no need to attend any church to maintain a spiritual outlook.  I still ‘tithe’ but now it’s donations to charitable orgs that I research carefully and have a proven track record of actually helping others….and either via coincidence or design, NONE of those orgs are affiliated with any particular religious institution.   

And for those asking.  Not Mormon.  Not Catholic.  Not SDA.  Straight up non-denominational christian church.  One of the larger ones in the region, responsible for spinning off many other versions of the same mega-church.  The pastor disappeared for several years after the incident but later re-appeared at another church.  I don’t blame God for allowing that pastor to continue to live and prosper.  I blame the Church for allowing that….even more proof to me that the institution of Church is the problem.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not to the degree of your story, but this makes me think of my in-laws funeral.


At the time, my husband and I were 26. He has a younger sister and a younger brother, the brother being 15 at the time. Their dad had killed their mom, then himself. It was a massive surprise to the family because there was never any abuse (physical, emotional or otherwise) that was happening in the house. The younger brother never noticed anything, neither did the grandma. To make a long story short, she fell out of love with him and wanted a divorce. He did not.


Their uncle had asked the pastor of the church they attended to speak at the funeral. The family specifically asked that he does not mention the nature of their deaths. To quote my husband, “this was the worst thing he has ever done to them.” 


Like I mentioned, there was no previously noted history of abuse that happened in the household to their mom or them. They already had several mixed emotions about the situation because their dad had always been good to them, yet he is the one who took their mom way. 


The pastor had arrived with an entourage of women from the church, which we did not know would happen. He went on to completely slander their dad, talking about how he was going to hell. Their younger brother was completely overwhelmed and sobbing. 


The man then went to the younger brother, the women laying their hands all over him. My husband was trying to pull him away but they kept grabbing him. He then tells him that he should be grateful his parents even lived this long, because earlier that day, he had to speak at a funeral for a two year old. “At least your parents didn’t die at two years old like this kid did!” 


Like what kind of fucked up comment is that?? I thought my husband was going to swing at him. I grabbed his arm. The entourage of women then spent the remainder of the service passing out flyers to everyone to attend the church. It was some of the most disrespectful shit I’ve ever seen.</div>

They're Salvadoran gang members who have committed heinous crimes against their own people for years without repercussion. 
I can assure you an Salvadoran in here will agree that this prison is the best thing that has happened to El Salvador in the last 25 years.
