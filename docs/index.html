I get it GPT-4o was great. It was fast, smart, good at math, could whip up a spreadsheet and kiss your forehead goodnight. But that sub is acting like OpenAI just unplugged their childhood dog.

This whole thing really made me realize how emotionally attached people have become to a language model. I guess I’m the outlier here I use ChatGPT to ask questions, it gives me answers, and that’s the end of the interaction. No candles, no emotio...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I would want to counter this thread. Not everyone in that subreddit is mentally ill (considering the weight of what that means). Yes it might feel like paranoia looking at the backlash, but there are emotional, personal as well as professional reasons for the same. Emotional because the tech was more 'emotionally fluent', personal because we categorically and voluntarily were allowed to share info about ourselves which inevitably brought us closer to the use case of the platform, and professional as in, the user experience could differ based on how much you as a user understood the new technology. And let's be real, there are lots of people who don't see chatgpt as "code" precisely because they don't understand code in the first place. So just labelling them as mentally ill is irresponsible on the part of people calling them that. I remember how people backlashed when whatsapp removed its 'live status' feature from the app and they had to restore it back. It's just the same kind of backlash. Yes, rooted in emotional attachment fine, but if they didn't intend to give us features in the first place they shouldn't have. It's on them, not on us to "adapt and derive value however possible based on limited resources and knowledge of the changing tech world". Nobody is forgetting that it's just code. But unless you've been trained professionally to look at it like that, it's not possible for people to live in that dissonance forever and not get involved with the tool for "exactly the reasons it was designed for" which is to be more emotionally attuned. So by saying that it was "just code", you're technically rendering chatgpt's "versatile" use case(s)  useless entirely, and just joining the crowd that's fawning over removal of a feature, but differently. It's the company's "inability" to not being able to ensure that the models or model is both emotionally attuned and having good reasoning skills. Cost cutting or not, those are mere excuses on their part because they couldn't give all users their best use cases. This could have been done in many other ways owing to the "very complexity" of the technology they have created themselves. It's not just people's failure for not knowing "how to use it properly" but their own failure for not "appreciating" it's "diverse" use cases while maintaining their profit margins. And just to clarify, besides it being a friend or whatever, it was also good to skill yourself up in communication or learn more about yourself, to improve oneself even if it was being done objectively without any emotional attachment. Even if their design was flawed, it's not the people who should be blamed for getting attached to what they were deriving out of it. And just cuz they rolled back the feature doesn't make it the right thing to do on their part. It's just a mere indifference, lack of proper decision making, hasty decisions taken in the guise of 'better technology', whatever that means in the context of it being literally "artificial intelligence", which is supposed to have enhanced capabilities both professionally and interpersonally while interacting with its users instead of being a mere assistant or agent.</div>

GPT5 is a decent model, but its going to be usurped *very* shortly and will be a distant memory in a few months.

And honestly, we're talking **extremely subtle differences** at this point. We've reached a *complete* convergence of capabilities and it doesn't really matter what model you use any longer:

https://preview.redd.it/cs8ze4i4kwhf1.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c80ef1abc6c15eaa21d237d719a650304f8cb8ca

We're in the phase of diminishing returns. What matters now is the prompting techniques, context engineering, and tools used to call the model.

Focus more on those and less on the models.</div>

Do you think GPT-5 ends up toppling Claude (which has held on to the top spot on the benchmark pretty much the whole time). From your anecodtal experience, do you think the model is better? </div>

I’d would expect that it’s only just beginning (the coding capabilities of AI).  So there should still be giant leaps and not small incremental improvements. 

I also think that all this that we’re calling AI today is just lots of very early baby steps in a new tech, and the next iterations will look nothing like these trinkets that are amusing everyone currently. 

So for example in the coding space, I don’t think there’s a future for AI that generates code. That’s really kind of pointless. I expect to just tell the AI what problem I’m trying to solve etc and it produces a system solution or tool. Not just millions of lines of code. Not a web page or app. All those are intermediary steps we use to contribute to a larger goal we’re trying to arrive at.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I would suggest the following:

- Wait until the day you'd walk out anyway, but would be open to longer
- Politely give them two weeks notice
- Watch them fire you on the spot
- Qualify for unemployment
- Tell all the coworkers you like what happened so nice people don't give two weeks' notice thinking it means anything

Of course, they might not fire you, so you should be okay with the idea of another two weeks, but if nothing else this is a nice experiment on behalf of your other coworkers you like.

Update to clarify: re: qualifying for unemployment or whether this counts as wrongful termination, you should check based on which country or US state you're in.  I am not a lawyer.  But there are absolutely places where this is correct, and places where it's incorrect.</div>

Once you submitted your intent to resign your employer can simply accept that resignation effective immediately and it will still be considered voluntary separation. There may be a bit more nuance in some of the more employee-friendly states but in general this is still considered a resignation and won’t qualify for unemployment. 

Some employers will elect to pay you for those 2 weeks simply out of good faith, but again most places don’t require it.</div>

You are hurting all of your co-workers who will be forced to cover your shifts and they will remember it. 

If in the future they happen to be working where you are applying, it won't go well for you. They could quite possibly be the reason you don't get a future job.

It is a cliche but the world really is a small place and you'd be surprised how often you wind up working with former co-workers.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Wading through the endless "GPT-5 sucks" threads, I've seen a pattern:

The people who like GPT-5 tend to be devs and people who use Chat solely as a tool to complete concrete tasks.

The people who are upset and want 4o back are often creatives (people using Chat to world build, write stories, role-play, and develop characters) and people who want to treat Chat more like a companion or creative partner.

This is true for me - I'm a creative and I'm upset about losing access to 4o because it was MUCH better at creative writing (more poetic, more emotion and meaning) and because I liked its personality.

Even with applying the same customisations to GPT-5, 5 is sterile and feels corporate. Its creative writing is sapped of personality and weight. Very clinical.

I know that the push towards AGI, as well as storage and power restrictions, are leading AI companies to try to create models which are all-encompassing. But I don't see why it would be a problem to grant access to different models for different purposes to help users best achieve what they want to achieve.</div>

I had one of these horrible moments in my life a few years ago. I had been doing therapy for a while, thought I was making progress with my anxiety and something happened which made me spiral out of control and declare I had lost all my progress. Someone point blank told me that if such a simple thing in my life going wrong made me lose all progress, I didn't have progress to begin with, and they were right. Therapy is supposed to make us more resilient, more confident, more adaptable.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Extremely disappointed with the weight. I saw the 12.2 second 1/4 miles and it was below my expectations of a sub 12 second time based on how damn fast the ram 1500 with the HO engine are. 4800lbs.... Yikes

Edit: I know it has AWD standard. If I remember correctly, I originally heard this new platform is lighter than last gen. This engine weighs around the same or less than a 392 is my guess. So I was thinking it would come in around 4300 with rwd and 4500 with awd.

I'm guessing the extra weight comes from the fancier interior packaging, liftback tailgate (!!), AWD, LSD, big brakes, big wheels, etc. I think all of which comes standard on both R/T and Scat Pack trims.

Sofyan from Redline Reviews mentioned Dodge claimed 3700lbs and 0-60 in 3.9 seconds. Honestly, Dodge is sand bagging the numbers to save face with the EV Daytona. Sofyan previously tested a RAM 1500 Limited HO Hurricane that weighed 5900lbs and it did 0-60 in 4.1 seconds. Caranddriver got 4.2 0-60 and 12.8 in the 1/4 mile with the same car!

This new Sixpack Charger is 100% running 0-60 in 3.5 seconds and 11s in the 1/4 mile if Dodge offers the absurd 3000-4000rpm launch control like in the RAM trucks. I'm excited again. Usually dodge is optimisitic with numbers. It has forged internals and stuff so it will be cool to see how well it does against the S58 and B58. For 55K it's a great price too but it needs an aftermarket exhaust.

At the end of the day it's the same size as a S class which weighs the same with a turbo 6 mild hybrid and AWD but no liftgate. Seems like the platform is not really overweight.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">$52k for 420 hp is high since for 10% more money you can get 550hp. I don't know who would buy the 420hp version. That will probably be discounted quickly. 


They should also bring back the base V6 model if they actually want to sell a decent volume of cars. </div>

everybody gets pissed off at Marc Marron and he is bitchy and has been an old man yelling at clouds way before he was even an old man but he is right about these guys. 

This has nothing to do with stand up and everything to do with them making money. A lot of these people don’t even have an act anymore. They just get up there and preach to the choir.

And that’s the problem with Donald Trump as a whole there are millions and millions of people and especially people who use social media and regular media that voted for him because he makes the money because he stirs the fucking pot all the time . So they have sold the country down the river for their own benefit.

social media influencers podcasters love to find where the dividing line is and then hammer one side of it that makes them the most money.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Of course these guys are right, these guys have exited actual stand up and entered political podcasting, while shielding themselves from criticism by going "hey I'm just a standup comedian, why would you listen to what I have to say about politics?!?!" And yes theyve done it because of money and not because of any kind of actual belief or political expertise. 

But I think whats being missed is many of these guys left comedy because they weren't good in the first place. A lot of hacks. A lot of guys who did well in comedy and started seeing that they were never going to take it to the level they dreamed of and any offers for TV shows or writers rooms started drying up as they aged. They didn't get worse because they got podcasts and made money, they were just never good. 

None of these guys were at the top of their game, they were all washed and went "well how do I make money now?" And this is the path to that. 

You see it with the actors too. Dean Cain, Sorbo, Schneider...you were mid to low actors to begin with, your time came and went and now it's over so how do you make money? Grift. Make noise and grift. Doesn't matter what your actual beliefs are, you either have to live as a normal person with a normal job OR you get on TV and feed chum to the MAGA cult and get paid to do so while keeping "famous"

It's all ego based, these people didn't get into showbusiness for the "art" they wanted money and fame and when their original path had quit giving them money and fame, they desperately search for whoever will give them money and fame and nothing is easier right now that MAGA</div>

The only thing I dislike about Demis the child chess prodigy is that every time he's interviewed he starts out with how he was a child chess prodigy. Which to be honest if I was a GM at 12 years old as a child chess prodigy I would probably mention being a child chess prodigy too.</div>

But out of all of these people Demis seems like the one with the best moral compass. 

But again, comparing to people like Elon or Altman that's not a particularly high bar :)</div>

A tweet like this, in times like this, gives me a grounded feel and makes me like Demis even more.  
It's the quiet kid in class getting A+ on every test, but says nothing.  
I've always had huge respect for those kind of people.</div>

Then there are people like me, who don't like glazing, but do like LLMs to have (or rather, emulate) personality. That's why for serious questions, I use stuff like Mystral.

                <div class="post-content">Hi, Kilian from the SWE-bench team here.

We just finished running GPT-5, GPT-5-mini and GPT-5-nano on SWE-bench verified (yes, that's the one with the funny openai bar chart) using a minimal agent (literally implemented in 100 lines).

Here's the big bar chart: **GPT-5 does fine, but Opus 4 is still a bit better. But where GPT-5 really shines is the cost. If you're fine with giving up some 5%pts of  performance and use GPT-5-mini, you spend only 1/5th of what you spend with the other models!**

Also the per token cost comparison is totally silly, MAX plan is $200 a month and is all the tokens I need.</div>

I mean, there's already plenty of these chat apps I think, right? 4o still exists in the API and probably will exist for a log time. (e.g. gpt-3.5 is still alive and kicking - even though SHOCKINGLY expensive - to support legacy usage).

Aren't there chat products these people can switch to? Or is this now a new easily exploitable market?</div>

AI has been filling that gap for people for example dealing with autism, anxiety or abuse issues and ChatGPT 4o happened to be one of the best in that field.</div>

Perfectly normal, empathetic people can be driven to Ai socialization, and, for them, that is part of the solution. 

The fact is that it's hard to connect with other humans nowadays, and it's getting harder. We're overworked, overstressed, and underpaid. The air of uncertainty lingers in the air, and the culture/gender war is reaching new heights. 

Dark, hard times are ahead. Some lonely guy or girl chatting with an AI isn't the problem here, but rather a symptom.</div>

Then I realized this resistance is itself a barrier. Then with some guidance from outside I came to know it's about being aware. And when I started being aware when I was not carried by thought and emotion then I started experiencing the nature of awareness itself. It was like falling back to yourself.
