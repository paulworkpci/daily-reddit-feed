Also, I don't think this device is rated for going 60km/hr on a highway, it's only good on flat surfaces, and probably at pedestrian speeds, and probably only for a short period of time.</div>

I think removing stalks and changing the front and rear lights doesn't do enough. Now granted if I were spending $80k plus I'd expect Porsche levels of luxury not Toyota Limited trim quality and feel. 

I wonder if the Model S and X will take the boutique route and just make them to order? Seems like Tesla is reducing their footprint in Europe and China now that Chinese manufacturers have entered?</div>

From 2016-2021 I'd say so, practically no other EVs on the market and they were making some pretty solid improvements each year. 

21-24, they did the major refresh then largely stagnated as they focused on the Model 3 &amp; Y, fine as they significantly cut prices in that time as well, something like $50k cheaper on the plaid

But these past two years, I wouldn't say so, especially considering the is significantly more competition, and as the tax credit cuts are approaching mercedes etc. have drastically cut prices and lucid etc. are pushing decent incentives on their sedans

&gt; Seems like Tesla is reducing their footprint in Europe and China now that Chinese manufacturers have entered?

I believe the issue for the S &amp; X in particular are that they are produced only in america which makes them more susceptible to trade issues. Mercedes can locally produce the e-class &amp; eqe in china, india, builds the eqe/eqs SUVs in america, etc.

And with europe they are very large cars to begin with</div>

&gt; We develop Urania, a highly parallelized hybrid local-global optimization algorithm

From their description it is very similar to my approach. I am also using a few epochs of BFGS training to find a local minimum and then a few epochs of no-gradient training to break free of it. In my case I use Differential Evolution for that, but it is super inefficient. Those guys a smarter them me (Duh!) and they did

&gt; Urania chooses a target from the pool according to a Boltzmann distribution, which weights better-performing setups in the pool higher and adds a small noise to escape local minima

This is awesome. I want to apply this to my problem as well. So sad they did not opensource it..</div>

What I’ve come to realize is that most of the shaking was past patterns and trauma dissolving. As one of my teachers said many times: “if you are in a posture of openness (like meditation or yoga, anything other than bliss or freedom is what’s leaving you. Let it go.

It does not necessarily mean you must be about to leave your physical body, but it is one of the common signs that conditions are right or that projection is approaching.

It has nothing to do with "impermanence". It is right to probe the experience, to understand it and not fear when it occurs in meditation.</div>

It might be sleep apnea which is potentially life threatening. Or at minimum they may give options for ways to minimize the snoring. I wanted my wife to be able to sleep so I went to get checked. No sleep apnea, but I did have extremely oversized turbinates and a large bone spur obstructing airflow in my nasal passages. Had a small procedure to correct those issues and my snoring is much, much less than before.</div>

I'm not sure humans are solving it with, as you said, no special training or instruction. There is a quite a bit of evolution behind us, it is not just like we just popped into existence, making us creatures of this very specific environment. I feel ARC is a bit like asking us to be performing in 5D space, not sure our intelligence will be that general then.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is why I have no concerns about the future of programming and developers alike.

I've noticed two things have happened over the past 20+ years in programming/coding and continues to happen:

1. Software development has become easier than ever
2. Software development has become more complex than ever

Humans have this tendency to take improvements that simplify things, and use that as an impetus to create more complex things, sort of undoing some of the efficiencies that were gained by new tech in the first place.

Like, the idea of being able to write full applications within a single language is an incredible achievement (e.g. React), and being able to virtualize hosting environments has streamlined deployments...and has also led to 5 page brochure static sites compiled in Astro and composed of multiple JS libraries, virtualized in Docker containers and hosted in "serverless" flex compute AWS EC2 instances....like, what?? So complicated for something that used to be quite simple (but, granted, there's more capabilities, as well).

This post is a great example of it happening again, now with GenAI tooling. It's not simplifying much of anything, it's increasing our capabilities to do every increasingly more complex endeavors. And that is already leading to so much more complexity across the whole workflow and stack.

If software was largely a static process with the same goals and end results required throughout the decades, then I would absolutely agree that these tools would spell the end of the industry, like the lamplighters that were extinguished by the light bulb. But software is constantly evolving and I am already starting to see that these tools are enabling more complexity to take shape, where software itself is going to increase in capabilities in terms of the problems it can solve. This means we'll be pushing these systems to their limits, and likely needing more technically oriented and skilled individuals to work with these systems that keep growing in complexity, not less. And to those that say these systems will just do all the new work that's required: that's just conjecture and we don't have any evidence thus far that is likely the case.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think it depends on what kind of environment you have. I can see environments with a lot of legacy tech laying around that was built up over 15+ years can be hard to adapt. But I've also seen cloud native companies built from the ground up with a very simple tech stack where adoption is easier. For example, the place I work at, we've built our entire platform w/ microservices on kubernetes, and they are all built using kotlin w/ springboot and using postgres as a db. All the services pretty much look the same but the business logic is different. This has made it much less challenging for us to adopt AI since we don't really have disparate environments to deal with.</div>

Father has cancer, smoked his whole life, and so on.

My cousin, 29, never smoked, no drugs, died last week of a brain hemorrhage. She said at the table that she wasn't feeling well and then she was gone.

Grandpa had cancer, died falling off his condo working on his garden.

                                <div class="reply-body">It doesn't really matter. His point is correct. Aging is a genetically programmed process. Once we have a way of simulating an entire cell down to the genetic level, we,cure all genetically determined problems. 

AI will be able to do this, just as it was able to solve protein folding. How long until we get there is questionable, but denis hasabis thinks he can do it by 2030. Certainly by 2040 seems very reasonable. And as soon as we've done it, aging will be cured overnight, kind of like infections were with antibiotics. 

There is zero question, that within 50 years, if we're all still here, aging will be completely cured. We'll have moved far beyond aging, into very sophisticated genetic engineering of superhumans, by that point.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">First off, for the naysayers in the comments, this is real. [Analysts knew this was coming almost two years ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTiZVuX5WRs) Of note in that video is the slide shown starting at 23:35. Even without CATL's incredible pricing of $10/kWh, they were predicting that sodium ion batteries would take the lion's share of the battery market. At $10/kWh, they will absolutely dominate and CATL will have problems keeping up with demand. For that reason, I doubt CATL is fudging the numbers here; they could ask substantially more than that and *still* have more customers than they could reasonably handle.   
  
Second, this is the first salvo for this battery technology and frankly not the thing people should be talking about. It will make EVs more affordable than ever, absolutely. But you need to think bigger. The problem with renewable energy is that it isn't dispatchable. It's windy when it's windy and if you don't need electricity at that particular time, too bad for you. There hasn't been a great way to store it up until now. This is revolutionary for renewable energy and rewrites the economics of that industry. This is the *true* beginning of the green revolution not because it enables EVs, but because it enables renewable energy to a degree not possible until this year. Fossil fuels are dead and so is nuclear.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yep, cheap grid scale batteries was the missing piece that allows renewables to become practical fossil fuel replacements. 

Now you only need enough wind or sun energy during peak generation to cover the next 24 hours. It completely changes the equation. 

But more than that, I want to see people putting these batteries on their own homes. Tying solar panels to in home batteries makes them super useful as well, while utilities were sick of people feeding power into the grid.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Indeed, that's a lifetime battery, easily. And this is only the second generation. 

This tech arrives just in time to power androids / humanoid robots. And power the second tsunami of EVs. Battery replacement was the major factor holding them back. With a cycle time like that, you're gonna get 30 years of use without replacement, makes them a viable ICE replacement. And the extra weight won't matter for anything except high performance race cars, which can just use lithium and nickel metal hydride, etc. 

What an amazing breakthrough.</div>

Google and Facebook, the two companies popping out the most papers in the field (rivalling with actual universities) have been the most outspoken about their research beyond transformers.

OAI has been more confused/incoherent in its communication about the whole thing (blame Altman for that: someday "we found the algorithm that will solve everything" aka scaling is all you need, the other day "we need a few more breakthroughs/we reached the limit of the current paradigm"...). Them and XAI have thrown too many marbles on training and developping the current models, i wonder if they still have some left for more fundamental research.

Iirc, OAI was publishing a lot of papers 2ish years ago, idk if they kept up with it to the level of Google and Facebook.</div>

Such a strange topic for him to avoid. You've spent the past few years talking about that client list over and over. Then you have *his closest friend for about 15 years* in front of you, and you don't even ask a single question about him or the list or anything... but instead **you endorse him**</div>

You know, we can endlessly debate whether Trump is a PDF, but wasn’t it worth it to make the lives of Americans worse via trade wars, soldiers in the streets, unaccountable law enforcement, and betraying all our allies?

He and the tech bros need the populace to stay docile and not demand for antitrust/regulations to slow down AI; so Sam throws these BS rainbow farts about ultra rich elite suddenly caring enough about the poors that they would share their wealth.

Sam and the bros need the populace to stay docile until the tech bros get too much momentum in their AI development to the point that they are unstoppable.

Once they consolidate enough power and influence, they basically become untouchable. But they are not quite there yet, so they need to smile and be humble to avoid unnecessary public blowback</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Giving people AI compute is stupid, the vast, vast majority of people are just going to take the most direct path towards turning that compute into money. That means selling your compute to someone who can use it or, when AI becomes capable enough, just turning the compute loose and telling the AI to fetch as high a price as possible.

That's *still* going to end up with the vast majority of compute as part of a monolith because it's just the most efficient way to manage things. Large companies are far more efficient than small businesses, and they have to deal with office politics and greed. AI will be able to scale far better than humans, to the point where any individual trying to do anything on their own with compute will be akin to trying to brew your own Coca Cola.

Ultimately that just circles back to the "default post-singularity" world. One in which there's a single monolithic AI that handles most decisions and everyone has access to some part of the resources it generates.</div>
