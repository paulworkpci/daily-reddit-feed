                                <div class="reply-body">is matter of having the right key words

searching "metal hardening" will throw you more generic results than reaching  
''martensite,pearlite,ferrite,austenite'' (different packing configurations of steel with different properties)

the issue is that more advanced key words are gated behind actually knowing them

AI bypass this by well....being well versed and being able to suggest you things relevant to your search that might be outside of the key words you actually know</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes but quantum computing scales as 2\^N rather than N (for classical computing). In classical computing, for example, if you increased the number of cuda cores from 10,000 to 20,000, you get roughly twice as much compute. If you increase the number of qbits in a quantum computer from 10,000 to 20,000, you'd get 2\^10,000 times more compute. 

If we can manage to get an ASI far smarter than us (\~300 IQ but 100x faster thinking speed) on classical hardware to figure out quantum computing (minimize errors, can scale easily, etc.) then it will become as the post said.</div>

How many orders of magnitude smarter than a single-celled organism is a human? And all that advancement is contained in a ~0.04 cubic foot container (the human brain). 

Now imagine a futuristic ASI that is maximizing every cubic foot of space it has to process information. And it isn’t just 0.04 cubic feet like a human brain. Instead, it’s a **MASSIVE** data center with measurements in cubic **MILES** of hardware. 

I have to believe that isn’t just additive, but rather multiplicative in terms of scaling up intelligence. So it wouldn’t be hard to believe it is many, many, many orders of magnitude smarter than us.</div>

Surely you're aware that agents are on the way. Agents will not act as tools when they become super intelligent.

They do this thing called "inference" now, which means they actually ponder the problem, aspects of it, and possible routes to a solution before answering.

That isn't mimic, that is actual intelligence and problem solving,  and it will only get better.

All these “o” models are nice for reasoning-heavy consultations, and some like o1 have evolved a bit (from its “preview” version) to be pretty decent at more textual tasks like redacting/writing, but still prohibitely expensive—and some like the new o3-mini, while clearly as good for reasoning, has regressed to old GPT-4.0 levels in terms of robotic language.</div>

As per my country’s law, once an employee becomes permanent, the company has got to retrain the employee if they’re no longer useful at their role due to technological disruption.

And if they can prove I can’t be of help anymore, then they can fire me, but they’ll have to pay me a handsome severance pay package and send me off to social security, which will mean I will probably be able to still eat for a 1-2 years more at least.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Pro user here, just tried out my first Deep Research prompt and holy moly was it good. The insights it provided frankly I think would have taken a person, not just a person, but an absolute expert at least an entire day of straight work and research to put together, probably more.

The info was accurate, up to date, and included lots and lots of cited sources.

In my opinion, for putting information together, but not creating new information (yet), this is the best it gets. I am truly impressed.</div>

This leak continues to fly under the radar. The redditor who leaked this information and photos in reply to [**this comment**](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/18zv05e/comment/kgk9azu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) later deleted their account.

Dailymail wrote an article about it with the redditor's photos and info included:

[**https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12943153/ufo-whistleblower-secret-talk-wall-street-nyc.html**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12943153/ufo-whistleblower-secret-talk-wall-street-nyc.html)

&gt;***The leaker said: 'It was hosted by a Wall Street bigwig and his lawyer friend.***

&gt;***Dailymail has since verified that the meeting took place and was told by sources that Coinbase advisor John D'Agostino and high-powered attorney John J. Altorelli hosted the event.***

Here's another thread with more photos and info:

You wanna talk about disclosure? Wheel this thing out and nobody will have any questions whether it's man made or not.

Sister: do you have jumper cables I could use?


Me: wya,  I'll bring them over


Sister: my car died beca-


Me: I said where are you at, I know what jumper cables are for. 






On the opposite end tho, is you asking for something that has a single purpose... For them to follow up with "why or for what" 


Me: can I borrow your car jack this weekend.

                        <div class="comment-body">Depends where you are.  But I agree.  Covid plus political hysteria on both sides has made it difficult to go out alone and meet people.  I see tons of people out and about, but it does feel like people are more locked in their bubble now. I've noticed this with people who work from home and still don't do anything outside of their home. Best thing to do is try to find hobbyist groups and that isn't hollow advice, I think Covid gave people a time to develop hobbies instead of just socializing.  I feel like socializing for sake of socializing is lame now and doing something constructive or interest-based is the new thing.</div>

Trump himself boasted in 2023 that he got Mexico to deploy 28.000 troops to the border, but I'm not sure where he got that number from.

Looming threat of tarrifs clearly is being used to force quick action, Canada announced these meassures because of threat of tarrifs back in december, and obviously 30day delay on them now is basically continuisly threatening leaders of both nations to act on what they outlined. I mean this is literally what Trump publicly listed as his prime negotiation tactic before election even, and how he plans to force action and agreements with outside countries using it.

But nah reddit it's always the same, black and white.</div>

Threatening your allies is not good in the long run. Relations will be severely impacted. If this is how US acts towards its closest allies (Canada) and most important trade partners (Canada, Mexico, china), it sends a strong message that America is not to be relied on and leaders of other countries will not forget. And If they have a choice, they will reliance on America in any way they can. 

So the way I see it Trump sacrificed helluva lot of power projection (because he caved in without demanding anything on top of what was already agreed before), prestige and reliability for nothing. This 30 day deadline or whatever it is now carries no meaning too, since everyone now knows that Trump doesn't want the smoke.

I'd be surprised if we even hear about the 30 day deadline from the Trump camp anymore, they will probably just let it fade away and have Elon Musk do something even more ridiculous than meddling with the treasury/Roman salute to draw the attention away</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is the right answer.

The majority of Americans, even ones who vote, do not "follow" politics. But many of the ones who don't vote go further than that - they deliberately avoid it. They don't read about it, they don't watch the news, and they won't discuss it because it doesn't interest them even a little.

There are a *lot* of people like that. If you're closely following multiple political stories, if you can name more than a handful of elected and appointed officials, if you can name specific bills and laws that were recently passed, you're part of a small minority. 

The number who actually bother spending time on a site like Reddit and discussing it on purpose is an even smaller minority. 

Half of those people probably have no idea what's even happening as a result of the election, and will vaguely wonder later this year why prices are going up so fast again...</div>

That means giving yourself a bedtime and sticking to it, making a daily routine that involves self care and activity and some human contact, if you can, and works those things into your work and school schedule.

Otherwise, you’re stuck, and it’s your choice to stay that way, because nobody is coming to save you but you. And you can totally do this one baby step at a time, friend.</div>

# Weyauwega, Wisconsin UFO (February 1, 2003)

On February 1, 2003, in Weyauwega, Wisconsin, a woman and her son witnessed a disc-shaped craft with a triangular pattern of lights on its underside. The woman had a camera in hand, taking pictures of her son sledding, when he pointed out the object in the sky. She quickly aimed her camera upward and captured multiple images. The object appeared solid and disc-shaped, with lights that cycled in different patterns. It moved silently across the sky before disappearing into the distance.

The witness remained anonymous, and no further details were provided. Investigators analyzed the photographs and found no clear signs of manipulation. The images showed expected JPEG compression artifacts from early 2000s digital cameras. A tree branch in front of one of the lights appeared “washed out,” likely due to overexposure.

Multiple UFO sightings were reported across Wisconsin around the same time. The case remains unexplained, with no known aircraft or logical explanation matching the object.

# Albuquerque, New Mexico UFO (July 4, 2019)

On July 4, 2019, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a witness observed a black matte teardrop-shaped object falling from the sky while watching fireworks. The object descended rapidly before stopping and hovering above their house. It then changed direction toward the street, remaining low enough that the witness estimated they could have touched it with a firefighter’s lift.

The craft emitted a low hum and made rumbling noises when what appeared to be an exhaust system activated. The exhaust resembled that of a jet but did not produce the same sound. The object had a faint, fuzzy field around it.

After hovering, it began to sparkle before dissipating into nothing, leaving behind significant smoke. The witness reported a strong feeling of connection to the object.

The case was reported later that month, on July 28, 2019. Albuquerque has had previous UFO activity, and the description of this object closely matches one reported by pilots at Eglin Air Force Base, which was referenced in Congressional UFO hearings in 2023. The case remains unexplained.

                        <div class="comment-body">I moved near Weyauwega in 2005 and met a handful of people who saw that craft - it was a popular topic in the area for a while.  Back then I was a skeptic and didn't really believe the phenomena, but found it very interesting that so many had claimed to see the same thing.  I didn't see these photos until a few years ago and it was very similar to what was described to me years back.</div>
