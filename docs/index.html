                                <div class="reply-body">It's very difficult for most people to overcome their normalcy bias. Most people live in a tiny bubble, and AI isn't anywhere near it. A few of us are like Meer cats, with a gaze fixed on the horizon looking for threats. We see it, but the rest just can't be bothered. "Nah, it won't affect me", "It'll be ok, we always find a way", etc.

I had a discussion with my parents the other day about Veo 3. They refused to believe that those videos were made by AI.

Most people are going to wake up one day having not payed attention and absolutely freak the f*ck out!

...and blue collar isn't safe either. I hear many trades people living in denial too. The robots are going to take those jobs as well!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">He's absolutely right. One of the things a lot of people don't understand is that the current living conditions and rights in the modern world are not because suddenly "society enlightened", but because the effects of the Industrial Revolution required more educated/skilled workers, and as such the groups of concentrated  power had to offer better living conditions and social mobility to the larger masses of the population so these skilled workers that powered the industries of the industrial revolution could emerge from there.

Now, if you remove that there's no more incentive for these rights and better living conditions anymore, we're back to 10 year old kids working the mines. It will not happen overnight, but society will gradually and ever increasingly deteriorate and move towards that direction. The state in which human society existed for thousands of years. The world of rights and social mobility is something extremely new in human history.

Furthermore, it'll be even worse, because as robotics advance, the mass of the population will also lose that "mob power" leverage that in the past even forced Roman Emperors to at least offer the people "bread and circus" to keep them from storming the palaces.</div>

Had the most crippling anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, almost like an emptiness.

It got worse and worse, my emotions became numb. I got chronic fatigue, life became unbearable.

I eventually took some time out of work last year for 8 months and started trying to understand myself more and heal.

Fast forward and I’ve been at this for a year now. I’ve seen some improvements, my emotions are very slowly c...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Anxiety comes from the mind's attachment to control. Do you agree?

In any situation where you don't know what will happen and have no control over events, anxiety arises. And then every attempt to control anxiety generates more anxiety because the mind wants to have control over being anxious and can't, and without having control, more anxiety arises and this creates a self-feeding cycle.

So when you meditate with the intention of reducing anxiety, what are you actually doing? You are exactly training your mind in a type of exercise to have control over anxiety! And this doesn't work because you are making the same mistake that anxiety arises from: meditating to control anxiety is still the same anxious mind trying to have control and that is what generates anxiety...

So, what to do?
Abandon the idea of ​​having control. You have no control over anything.

In meditation practice, this translates as just sitting and letting whatever happens happen.

In everyday life, stop trying to predict what will happen, just stay with what is happening.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey man, it really does get better with time.
I’ve also been dealing with anxiety—mainly from smoking weed. I used to smoke like 4 times a day for almost 4 years straight. Finally quit last October and haven’t touched it since. That alone made a big difference.

On top of that, some people I’ve known since childhood turned their backs on me and showed their true colors. That kind of betrayal hits deep, but it also helps you see who’s really meant to stay in your life.

What’s been helping me lately:

Doing breathing exercises or meditation for 15–30 minutes every morning and evening

Cold showers (they suck at first but really help)

Going for walks outside and working out

Reading good books that shift my mindset

And honestly, journaling. Just writing stuff down—what happened during the day, how I felt physically and emotionally, what I liked or didn’t like. It’s like taking out the mental trash so it doesn’t pile up.


&gt; Meditation alone won’t fix anxiety. It helps, but it’s not magic. You’ve got to combine it with other habits that support your body and mind.



One last thing: don’t try to fight or escape anxiety. Don’t fear it. Try to accept it as a natural part of you, like, “yeah, this is me right now.” The more you stop resisting it, the less power it has.

You got this, bro. Seriously. Don’t give up.

Ps : I used Chatgpt to detail this text, cuz english is not my first language. Again, good luck. How old are you?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Read the book : The power of Now by Eckhart Tole...NOW... Depression and anxiety... Two things we hear so much about now, but nobody understands it. As explained in the book: you are in the NOW, while your brain or mental is looking at the future, possible scenarios, potential dangers. This create a gap between  now and the future that the brain is struggling to fill. Same thing with depression but with the past. I read that book like 3,4 times. You need that book, you can get it in the app store or google play. I bought physical copies in both english and my first language. Even offered it as a gift for my brother on Christmas. Come home to the present moment, every moment is a present waiting for your full attention. Real talk.

Edit:  get the audio book too, tole's voice is so soothing.</div>

"Caveats - it'll be true before 2027 in some areas, maybe also before EOY 2027 in all areas, and "done more effectively"="when outputs are judged in isolation," so ignoring the intrinsic value placed on something being done by a (specific) human.  
  
But it gets at the gist, I think.

"Will be done" here means "will be doable," not nec. widely deployed. I was trying to be cheeky by reusing words like computer and done but maybe too cheeky"</div>

My job, and the job of 90% of my coworkers could be replaced by AI as it stands currently. There is a 0% chance that my company is going to do that. There are barriers to entry, costs, time, customer understanding/goodwill. 

Moreover, incorporating such cutting edge tech is a colossal risk. We've been using human labour for thousands and thousands of years. Replacing that overnight with experimental tech is a scary prospect. And with such new tech that has the possibility of causing social upheaval, there's the risk of government legislation changing how we're allowed to use it. 

If my company, tomorrow, replaced 90% of it's workers with AI (this assumes we get the hardware and software perfectly implemented instantly) a huge amount of our customers get confused and shop elsewhere. Also in 2 years, the government may begin taxing or regulating against the use of AI to protect citizens against the potential social upheaval that's coming. That's a huge risk that could END the business.</div>

Man if you need a drain unclogged before 2027, you might have to wait, but after, you will have your pick, and cheap too! They might just work for food! Seriously we need to be writing our legislators now about this. If all white collar work is automated that quickly, UBI and automation tax is the only way I see forward. We need love and compassion and not the typical attitude toward welfare. The dotcom and internet and the invent of personal computers started a white collar revolution. Our world thrives on white collar work, In The USA 57.8% of the workforce is white collar. We have a lot of users on this sub. I think it’s pertinent to start the ball rolling.

There will be only a handful countries able to roll out UBI, at least theoretically.

An "automation tax" is a non starter. You can't tax "automation". You can tax *property*. In a very Marxist sense you can tax the outputs compared to human work, but there is little produced now that is comparable. A hand made mug put together in a pottery class and injection molded ceramic are kind of hard to compare. That's an argument we've had for literally centuries now though.

UBI is a dangerous concept. You are going to be on your best behavior. Your social credit score had better not fall to far!

Universal basic *services* on the other had? Now we have equity. Everyone has all of the bottom of their needs pyramid completely covered. We might have to move people around. We might have to eat government cheese. But lights-out-warehouses and robotic trucks dropping off our needs like reverse-garbage collection might be the Star Trek Economics we've been hoping for.</div>

I hope OP will forgive me for trying my hand at restoring this, but with only a few minutes work I've got what I think is a much more accurate restoration, and one that could be further improved with more work.

Edit: There seems to be some confusion. This image is *still AI*, it's just AI being used with more direction and intention, as part of a process using a combination of machine learning and other methods. Sure, I selected where to do the inpainting and then colorized it but I wasn't hand painting anything or doing the work myself. That was all AI.

AI is a tool, and it takes Human expertise to use it effectively. I don't care for the idea that what I did here was embracing "tradition" or "10,000 times better" than the ones "made with AI" because this one is made with AI too.</div>

                <div class="post-content">A lot of hotels will provide bottled water to the room at some charge if you open them, sometimes up to 5x what the bottle is worth. That usually leaves you with only tap water as your source. 

However, many hotel fitness centers are equipped with newer water coolers which not only chill the water, but filter it as well. Fill up a water bottle there instead of paying! </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Indexing is unbelievable!  In side by side tests in ask mode asking questions about the codebase indexing comes out ahead every-time. Without indexing sometimes the LLM is able to surmise which files to look in based on proper directory structure and file names and utilize the more basic search tools available to find the same thing as o design does but always at the expense of tokens.

In terms of Cline’s stance, we’re not up against them so it’s not really concerning to me that they’re taking a different direction. Cursor and Windsurf have made a lot of the correct calls on how to do things so we’re going to take our lead from them on this.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The last time I used cursor they were not doing actual context compression to extend the length of time the agents can work on the tasks. They were i think using weaker models to compress every prompt to the stronger models and not giving full context access. 

I think the cool part about the Roo solution is that you can manage when context compression triggers and you can build your own recipe for the context compression. Claude code's for example is very effective. 

So it lets both the orchaestrator agent adn the agents themselves to manage their own context, and perform better on longer running tasks / get more done in a single pass or task.  It's been pretty stellar for me so far.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">nvidia's neural textures are a really interesting look at using ML for media compression and reconstruction. it's part of a broader family of techniques that includes dlss and rtx video upscaling - all different implementations of the same core concept, just optimized for different use cases.

dlss upscales lower resolution game rendering in real-time, and rtx video enhances compressed footage during playback. both use ai to reconstruct detail that was never there originally.

so the idea of ai filling in missing information to create better looking content (from content that had a smaller original storage/computational cost) is already happening. it's not exactly the same as traditional codecs of course, but we're definitely seeing early versions of what you're talking about.</div>

You're spot on. This is probably the only objectively true take when it comes to AI use in software development.

Nobody will deny you can absolutely "vibe code" something with zero software building experience. But there is absolutely a limit to how complex your app can be, and how far AI will take you. The truth is, to really unlock the power of AI you need to be just as big an expert as it to reach peak collaborative efficiency.

AI in the hands of a talented engineer with strong technical skills is a stupidly powerful force that is often an exponential force multiplier.</div>

junior dev getting good with AI tools

using Claude Code and Roo

actually shipping projects faster than ever

still doing the hard thinking and architecture but AI handles the grunt work

feeling pretty good about my progress

browse reddit during lunch break

see post: "They lied to you. Building software is really hard"

mfw the author probably used AI to write this anti-AI article

article quality suggests they didn't use it very well

realize I just got clickbaited by someone complaining about tools that are literally making my job better

check source: "The Nordcraft Blog"

never heard of it, probably some random dev's medium clone

turns out to be a SaaS "web development engine" product blog for a company that seems to have an agenda

tfw you waste 5 minutes reading someone's business blog hot take disguised as wisdom

go back to coding with my "cheating" AI tools

ship features, make money, sleep well

maybe the real lie was the clickbait we read along the way</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">People that don't know how to build software think it's about writing code. It is, but not really.

It's about solving problems for humans. And AI doesn't understand humans like other humans do. It can build stuff that works very well objectively, but humans don't work like that.

For example: I recently had to migrate a project from .NET 6 to .NET 8. A junior or AI would probably assume this would be the perfect moment to deal with technical debt, make big improvements and fix certain stuff. Why not you'd think?

Because customers can have their entire business depend on whatever very specific quirks your software used to have and now that you 'fixed' them you just gave your customers a whole lot of work and pissed them off.

So just because a piece of software looks good on the outside and on a technical level doesn't mean you are creating value.</div>

Most likely it match gpt4o (bad model) in some tasks and fail miserably on others.

                                <div class="reply-body">Blame Tim Cook and the executive leadership. They have been focused too much on useless "luxury" items like Vision Pro, Apple Car, or Airpods, and abandoned treating technology as a commodity service. I do think they will fare better when Robotics gets their "ChatGPT moment", since their expertise was always in hardware. But if they miss that train than Apple will ironically go the way of Blackberry.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Producing a professional-quality 1-minute advertising video rarely costs less than R$100,000 reais ($17,543 dollars) in my country. This amount takes into account the hiring of an agency or production company, a complete team (direction, creation, writing, camera, editing, lighting, sound recording, sound and visual effects), costumes, a cast with multiple actors, copyrights, studio rental, set construction and specific elements such as animals in the scene.

And this does not include the costs ...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Maybe the employees of the ad agencies but the heads of those agencies still will have a better idea for a prompt than the company heads that need marketing done.


Creative minds are still needed even if physical labor goes out the window (actors, set builders, camera operators etc.). 


I've seen way too many cringe worthy things generated by people on these subs to believe idea people and writers are going to be out of the job. They're going to be more important than ever. At least until the AI can come up with good concepts stories on its own without any promoting needed beyond "hey make a sentimental ad for this product that tugs people's heart strings" and it spits out a Spielberg movie. Which I'm assuming will happen eventually but definitely not today. </div>

Não entendo porque algumas pessoas não conseguem admitir a realidade das coisas. Me lembra muito aquelas que também dizem que sabiam o tempo todo de algum plot twist de filme, só não falaram antes.

Mas minha teoria para ser mais impactante é o fluxo de informações que seu cérebro aceita como verossímil em cima do que talvez não seja: como áudio tá muito bom, a compreensão já está cooptada em 50% pelo menos. É tipo gritar "vai a m&amp;rda" no transito e apontar para a porta do outro carro aberta, a pessoa imediatamente entende o contexto e assume que interpretou o que você falou errado ("porta aberta").</div>

The only way he's getting back on stage is if Rogan encourages him to do so, and I don't think Joe is going to open that Pandora's box twice.</div>

In a groundbreaking advance, scientists have successfully used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to eliminate HIV-1 DNA from the genomes of human immune cells. Unlike existing treatments that suppress the virus, this method completely removes the genetic blueprint of HIV from infected T-cells.

In lab tests using cells from real patients, not only was the virus removed, but the edited cells also resisted reinfect...</div>

CCR5 gene controls the mechanism HIV uses to enter and infect a cell. People lacking it are functionally immune to HIV. 

But that is not an elegant cure. 

This cure is far better, done within ethical oversight. Instead of eliminating CCR5, they cut HIV genetic code out of the cells entirely, offering a true cure that little repairs the human genome back to what it was before being infected.

I had a funny thought reading this article. All these antivaxxers that claimed the mRNA shot "changes your DNA" and they thought it safer to risk getting the virus. I wonder if they realize that viruses actually do change your DNA.</div>

I had to stop training due to a neck injury, switched to trail running then CrossFit because I needed a shitload more muscular endurance (as it turns out, 4 minute fights dont need as much as 8 hours running up and down a mountain).  

I got back on the tatami 2 years later and... Everything was so weird. I felt so strong and fast and nearly impossible to exhaust. I had lost a lot in technique but I made up for it so easily just by tiring out my opponent or simply brute forcing them off the ground. Even the progress in flexibility and mobility were hard to ignore. It feels like cheat mode...</div>
