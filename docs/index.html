A guy called me from there and said yes I see where we messed up, I can offer you a one-time credit of $120 (nowhere near the benefit that they’d messed up). Pretty much said to suck it up otherwise. 

I filed an FCC complaint and reached out to customer service again. Once I mentioned the FCC complaint, they sent me right over to a supervisor. He wasn’t able to fix the original problem, but he was able to offer another solution that benefited me more than the original deal would have.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">rapamycin positive effects were being induced by other methods.  rapamycin negative effects not worth the squeeze, and speed of aging increase.  Speed of aging increase does not necessarily mean you'll die sooner, but means in this context the telomere length shorting and other DNA epigenetic data indicated more breakdown with rapamycin than without.  Rapamycin and metformin not worth it if you can get the positive effects through other means.  

Rats have less anti-cancer / anti-aging stuff inbuilt in them then humans do (dna copying and repair stuff, 2 years vs 60 years), which also probably has an impact here given the mechanisms in place.</div>

Even gpt4 did better at some tasks than doctors, it was just too unreliable without serious supervision. It was still excellent for bringing rare diagnoses to an actual doctor's attention though.

On the one hand it's highly regulated so change will likely be slow. 


On the other hand, the competency of AI vs human physicians is soooo important that if its superior to physicians (even by a small amount) it just has to take over.


People may be willing to accept slightly lower competency of humans in other fields due to resistance to change, habit, or other reasons at least for a while. Not so in medicine. At the end of the day, in medicine, all people care about is competency </div>

Just sent him 5-6 different ones, 20-30 pages, made by different sources, but connected to soccer (i worked in soccer, so have all kinds of statistical match reports handy).

It swallowed them all. But not only that, without me saying a word, mf understood whats in them and all alone started to spew rather solid analisys :)

That was a bit surprise, I expected that I will have to upload and then give him some directions ... Nop, started talking about them as soon as they were uploaded :D</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Same goes for porsche. The benefit was you could switch cars from time to time, 911 for the summer then cayenne for the fall, but it was 3.5k/mo for a taycan. 

I know only one person who tried it, did a targa for 4-5 months a year, tax deductible, because he had nowhere to store or use the car the rest of the time. in fairness he was happy with it but that’s a very specific case where it was impossible to get a targa otherwise.

Few companies also let you do short term rentals (audi had the biggest network, bmw &amp; mercedes tried in certain areas for a bit), goal was you’d rent a car under market rates, you’d love it so much you’d buy it, obviously that didn’t happen, dealers lost money, and most pulled out

Toyota still does it though, no idea how good dealers are with that.

I also know of a few people who lease a tesla for 3yrs, did the $5k option that covers charging/connectivity/etc. for 3 years, then have insurance through tesla, minimal maintenance since it’s an ev, that’s probably the closest you can get to renting a car.

The issue with this article is people are open to subscriptions because of rising prices with tariffs i.e they’re led to believe the subscription will be cheaper somehow, it won’t be.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I was intrigued when Care by Volvo launched but I think state governments really threw a wrench in Volvo's plans.  To my understanding, Care by Volvo was initially meant to be a subscription service where Volvo (or one of their financial partners) owned and registered the cars and provided them to subscribers in what was legally considered a **rental**.

State governments caught wind of that and freaked out.  Firstly, each state wanted to make sure cars were taxed in their home state rather than in some conveniently low-tax jurisdiction.  Secondly, states want the registration info for long-term subscriptions to match the primary driver, not some corporate entity.

So, in the end, Care by Volvo just became a short-term lease, with some additional sweetening for swapping into another Volvo before the full term was up.  With that came all the other crap that comes with leasing, including my pet peeve: In my state you have to pay sales tax on the entire value of the car for a lease, making short-term leases exceptionally terrible.

If and when someone finally makes a car subscription work, they definitely need to address this issue somehow - if I want to subscribe to a $50k car for a year, ain't no way I'm ok with paying an extra $250/month for taxes on top of the actual payment for the car.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">right. nada *wants* this to be true, and they're trying to get in people's minds that this kind of thing is acceptable by doing things like putting out deceptive survey results like this.

but this 56% certainly would *not* actually sign up for these services once they realize that bundled subscriptions will *always* cost more than separate car payments, insurance, and maintenance [of course; or else why would car companies want to sell you this bundle?].

by making a consumer captive to one single source, you eliminate competition and choice, and further erode things like right-to-repair expectations, quality workmanship, and pricing pressure on suppliers.</div>

One of the VPs gets flack for something that was done that shouldn't have happened. They then unleash their angry tirade on some middle level manager laden with the worst assumptions of the employee responsible.

And like clockwork, approaching the employee and asking for the full story almost always goes one of 3 ways.

And as middle management, you tend to have to be that buffer zone where you can take that moment to intake the info and then go down the line finding out more so you have the full picture and not just the gut angry reaction from above.  

I too have found that there's usually more to it than "Oops, I forgot to..." but even when it's that situation, going into it from an inquisitive standpoint versus and aggressive one is how you get buy-in from your team for sure.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, I have had this mindset as a manager for a long time. I started viewing everyone's mistakes as "there's probably a good reason as to why this particular thing happened" instead of texting the manager group chat "WHO TF CLOSED LAST NIGHT?"

I work in restaurants and it seems to be a common thing for managers to approach everything from a *negative* point of view rather than a positive one. If there's something not done right, if there are ever *any* issues that happen, they just start from "this was done because of incompetency" or "this was done *maliciously* / *on purpose*" and it's really frustrating. Additionally, a lot of managers will nitpick every single little thing that doesn't get done and bitch about it. All it does is *create* conflict and animosity between managers when we start from the position of pointing the finger and blaming someone. When I encounter things not done from the closing shit when I open, I just deal with it and move on. A lot of managers will write a goddamn manifesto because a fork was on the floor in dish or one of the drains wasn't cleaned properly.

Relevant story about this: A few months ago, I had another manager just absolutely lose it in the group chat because I had forgotten to follow up with someone to make sure that we had potatoes prepped. I simply had not been told that this was a reoccurring issue and I also had no idea that this was done during my shifts rather than during the day. Optimally, he should have shot me a direct 1-on-1 text and said something like, "Oh hey, by the way, when you close on Thursdays, make sure these racks are full of potatoes. It makes it difficult when there aren't enough potatoes and one of the kitchen has to go back and prep some. I'm sure you weren't aware and just wanted to make sure you knew. I'll see you at noon, bro!" 

Instead, this manager opted to go into the group chat and start getting violently hostile saying shit like "so are we going to start doing potatoes on thursday night or are we too busy doing schedules in the office during volume?" I wanted to lose my fucking shit in the group chat at him and had a whole aggressive ass response typed up and instead I was like "Hey, sorry, I was looking at it last night and I saw several trays there and thought they were good to go. I haven't been told that this was an issue on Thursday nights, sorry. I'm in at noon and I'll prep some myself." To which he replies with a picture of an empty rack. Turns out they stocked the line with the potatoes that I had seen previously and I did not realize that they hadn't stocked them up front yet. Genuine mistake on my part and I tell him "Sorry, I guess they must have stocked the ones that I saw, that's my bad." And then he replies, "Heard. I'm going to go up to the line and check and see if there are 200 potatoes up there."

He was a complete ass for absolutely zero reason. I called my Director immediately and sent him a screenshot of what was said. I had never been treated like that by another manager (on the same level) before. I was also so fucking pissed that I didn't go in until after the other manager had left because I knew that we would get into it if we crossed paths and most likely end in both of us getting fired.

I: 1) apologized, 2) recognized that I made a mistake, 3) gave an action plan on how to fix said mistake, 4) made another action plan on how to prevent this from happening on any night that I close ever again, yet he was still so unnecessarily aggressive and hostile for literally no reason. That next Thursday, I even stayed until 1AM to make sure that that potato rack was completely full. I didn't have to, but I did it because I don't like to make mistakes more than I hate being petty over stupid shit.</div>

I once had a manager who was so up his own ass about corporate speak and not using any negative language whatsoever that I came to him once and told him "Hey, we've got a problem-" and before I could tell him what the issue was, he cut me off with "We don't have *problems*! We have opportunities for improvement!" I looked him straight in the eye and responded "Okay. We have an opportunity to improve the restroom by cleaning up the shit that's smeared all over the walls, and it's not going to be me." He very noticeably stopped with the toxic positivity after that incident.</div>

I noticed that Claude's Pro version has [usage limits](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8324991-about-claude-pro-usage). Does this also apply to coding with VS Code? 45 posts per five hours is really low if you count all the coding suggestions too.

Does it work with VS Code with add-ons like Winsurf and Copilot?</div>

Kinda wild how many people actually trust others with their health and lives. That’s an inside job, y’all.

                        <div class="comment-body">In simple English, they basically took inspiration from actual neurons and allowed the signals going into the models' neurons to influence each other before they enter into the neuron. In some sense, if the model has a semantic concept signal coming into a neuron, and other neurons say things like the first signal is close to the ground truth, then the neuron actually experiences a larger signal.

Broken down more, if I have a box, and I put fruit into the box, this is kind of like me watching what you put into the box and switching the fruit to a different one, sometimes same or different depending on what you put in and what other people put in. Since the inputs can affect each other, you end up getting a richer representation within the neuron itself. 

Some notes of hesitancy, while the method they detail in itself appears to be able to scale (quickly work with our current infrastructure), they did not test it on a very large model. So, in theory it should work well, but it has not yet been tested on anything large.</div>

This paper contains some toy RL examples, CIFAR-10, and, the closest thing to a language dataset, Meta's bAbI. There are no results on natural language or advanced reasoning tasks.

I'm not saying it wouldn't be capable for doing those tasks, but the authors have yet to prove that. Which makes me suspect when they claim it's the successor to the transformer...</div>

Most practical option is just release what you have and hope someone with access to an ai super computer cluster will do all the testing for you.

For me, the premise of their idea makes sense.  I have seen research that is takes approximately a 1000 artificial neurons to emulate 1 biological neurons output.  
I think ai algorithms are still early days.  Kind of like ray tracing in computer generated movies used to take months of super computer time to render a scene.  Now, modern algorithms and hardware can do it all in real time.</div>

She had been in a wheelchair for the last 14, and my entire life revolved around her wellbeing. Everything, my job, our routines, the way I planned each day and night, was built around her needs. We were inseparable. And she was the most intelligent person I’ve ever known. I couldn’t hold a candle to her. And now she’s gone.

It wasn’t related to her long-term illness, it came without warning. I held her in my arms...</div>

This can be 50,000 thoughts a day. We have to become aware of the mind, only then can we still it and kill it. But we think that the mind is king.

                        <div class="comment-body">People are time poor, have a lot going on in their lives, have kids and are overwhelmed….So many reasons, and that’s just the impacts on one’s ability  to set aside the time. When it comes to meditation and people choosing not to do it, it could be multiple things. Some feel silly and self conscious, some don’t know where to start or how to do it, some think they won’t be able to switch their minds off so they don’t even try. Some may have tried it but they felt intimidated by it, or they didn’t feel anything so they didn’t persist with meditation practice. With the latter, it’s the same reason why someone might go to the gym but stop after a week or a month; they don’t see the results and don’t want to put in the effort. 

Meditation is like a muscle; if you don’t move it you lose it, and you need to be consistent and persistent to see results. 

When something transforms your life - whether it’s faith, fitness, mindfulness, or healthier habits - it’s easy to let pride sneak in. You start to feel better, and that’s powerful. But be careful not to confuse personal growth with moral superiority. Everyone has a different starting point and journey. True growth brings compassion, not judgment.</div>

I had to have been between the ages of 6-9. I was playing in a backyard of our babysitter's with her son (my age) and my younger brother when I stopped and began feeling some sort of blissful moment looking at a patch of dandelions.. I didn't realize until recently that I was experiencing an open-eye meditation practice. 


I explained it to my mom, who told me to never do that again and made it sound very unhealthy. I tried explaining how good it felt. She didn't agree. I only slightly continued it daily, spontaneous, without telling and would interrupt it often, remembering my mom said it was bad. 


I never forced the practice. It just sorta was a thing for me that I would just call it daydreaming as I would explain it to others. Those others I described it to said they've never experienced that, further committing my reasoning that it must be bad somehow then. "If it's too good to be true, it probably is."</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The ego doesn’t like to be questioned. Some people glorify a strong ego that never admits anything but greatness. Accepting reality as it is contradicts the “I am the greatest“ mentality. 

Self confidence and healthy self esteem are good things, but they have to be tempered with honest assessment and realistic self evaluation. Many people would rather just go on assuming that they have all the answers. 

When you never ask questions, you’re never missing any answers. It’s easier that way. The ego will create an internal narrative that fills in all the blanks. 

A different kind of mind wants REAL answers. Those are the people open to meditation and self reflection</div>

When we look at the AI coding landscape, there are actually two fundamentally different approaches:

**Approach 1: Subscription-based infrastructure** Tools like Cursor and Windsurf operate on a subscription model ($15-20/month) where they handle the AI infrastructure for you....</div>

As someone with a little tool fatigue who is defaulting to Claude Code at the moment, I'd love your take on how/when developers should pop their head up and review the progress all these tools have made and pick the best one. It's almost like the tooling needs a benchmark (same model, same prompt, different agent-based solutions). Apologies if this already exists and I don't know about it.</div>

love this idea

Honestly, I think the approach is to find an IDE you like (be it Cursor/Windsurf/VS Code) and then as long as you're using one of the tools defined in Approach 2 (or any others that fit which I failed to mention), you're going to be getting SOTA results as long as you're using SOTA models. 

The models are the real secret sauce in Approach 2, not the tools. The tools are really just teeing up the models to hit a home run, and they get better as the models do. 

Maybe keep in touch with what's going on, but don't feel like you're really missing out.

The only caveat I would point out with Claude Code is the case when Anthropic isn't putting out the best models. I think you're in good shape with it right now, but bear in mind you are locked into Anthropic models.</div>
