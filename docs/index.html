The whole exchange was f-cking stupid

Joe is not serious and never serious about anything.  He was trying to  bash Biden while probably thinking wait oh shit  Bernie is holder ,  and tried to compliment Bernie but just sounded like an idiot.

And I don't think anyone realized what Bernie's point was.  Bernie said AMERICANS would not be happy about his age.  He is 100% correct and it does not mean Bernie thinks he's tool old which is another argument.    I</div>

As we all know, AI tools tend to start great and get progressively worse with projects.


If I ask an AI to generate a simple, isolated function like a basic login form or a single API call - it's impressively accurate. But as the complexity and number of steps grow, it quickly deteriorates, making more and more mistakes and missing "obvious" things or straying from the correct path.


Surely this is just a limitation of LLMs in general? As by design they take the statistically most likely next...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is correct, it also helps to simplify your architecture. A monolith is going to be much more difficult for the LLM to handle then a microservices ecosystem. For instance if I need a new lambda that grabs a list of records from a database, sorts them in a certain way, and filters by XYZ filter, all I have to feed the LLM is the database structure and the desired output. 

But if I had a monolith where the complexity of different functions need to be updated for it to understand the context that makes the LLM much less efficient.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think it's a combo of a bunch of things:

* Natural language is very ambiguous
* Keeping a large context window is very expensive and AI companies are trying to stop burning money quite so fast
* LLMs are not really allowed to turn around and say everything is already there - so if you tell it to fix something, it will find something to fix, even if nothing is broken. This new code could end up being some part that is never even touched and then further fixes will just 'fix' unused code
* LLMs don't have a memory
* LLMs don't really have understanding, although this could be philosophically argued maybe
* LLMs are operating off statistical probability - that means they have far more training material from average coders than export coders</div>

LLMs will always give you what you *want*, but not necessarily what you *need*. 


That's a massively important distinction and one that I find to be the biggest issue with using these tools without a near full understanding of what you are asking it to do, and the outputs they generate. </div>

The AI was presumably trained on stuff like StackOverflow questions, Reddit Posts, LeetCode solutions, etc, so it will be very effective at answering those questions.

Nobody goes on StackOverflow and asks how to create a video game or something else of that complexity, so the AI will have to do *real* work and that is where AI fails so often.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Number 3 is a huge part of it. Usually, you have prompted the AI to do something. “Fix the errors in my code”. It’s not going to come back and say “everything’s perfect, I don’t have to do anything!” 

What’s worse is without careful prompting, it tries to be helpful, maybe it will use a fancier data type for a variable for more “flexibility” (which is a genius level excuse for doing  something that doesn’t actually change anything) 

But at the end of the day, this is just how life works in general.  You gotta be specific, or you can’t complain that you didn’t get what you wanted.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You're hitting on something we deal with constantly when helping companies scale with AI. Your math is spot on about the compounding probability issue, but there's another layer to this that I think gets overlooked.

The degradation isn't just about statistical probability - its about context windows and how LLMs handle state management across complex systems. When you're building something simple like a login form, the AI has all the relevant context right there. But as projects grow, it starts losing track of earlier decisions, architectural patterns, and business logic constraints.

I've seen teams prototype incredible demos in hours with these tools, then spend months debugging edge cases and integration issues that the AI couldn't anticipate because it doesn't have that "mental model" you mentioned. Humans maintain persistent understanding of the overall system architecture - AI tools are essentially making local optimizations without global awareness.

The other thing is that AI excels at pattern matching against training data, but real production systems have all these weird enterprise requirements, legacy integrations, and domain-specific edge cases that aren't well represented in training sets.

At Starter Stack AI we're trying to solve this by giving AI better scaffolding and constraints upfront - basically giving it more of that architectural context so it makes fewer compounding errors. But yeah, you're right that this is a fundamental limitation of how these models work.

The key is using AI for what its good at (rapid prototyping, boilerplate generation) while having humans handle the systems thinking and architectural decisions.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That's also why context window size with minimal needle in the haystack issues is so important. It's also one area where I think/hope we'll see a lot more improvements.

Using lsp (language service protocol) also shines here, as it makes llms access to the surrounding code much more efficient.

I have very few problems with over eagerness this way, if it really has all the context it needs for the task, and claude code can really be leveraged.</div>

When working on system design or architecture the output is also different. You keep it on the thinking part (collaboratively) and the artifacts are documents, designs etc. Not code.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is true. I used to do online chat support for Redbubble. At one point we switched over to a chat tool called Intercom, and that’s when we were able to see users typing in real time before they hit submit. 

The idea was that we could get ahead of them a bit and prepare an answer for a fast response. 

We did see the occasional curse word/phrase head in our direction before the user deleted and typed something else. Not as often as you’d think, though.</div>

Too often the finish line for retirement comes, and yet known house expenses aren’t resolved; HVAC units nearing end of life, old roof, original appliances, an ancient hot water heater… they’re all begging to throw a wrench in your nest egg when you least expect it, and sometimes multiple at a time.

Finishing my mudroom

Install the mudroom sink

Maybe some cabinets in there

Why isn't the garage siding done yet?

What about that trim? 

The garage door doesn't close. 

Or the other one, with no knob. 

The living room is 80% painted. 

Are curtains or blinds a thing anymore?

Peeling trim paint. 

The dog ate the trim, and chewed that part too. 

How did they get over there? 

Finish the top of the stairs gate

Finish the lofted bed

Finish the bedroom closet

Maybe put the last bit of fascia on the deck.

Do we really need stairs?

These are just the unfinished projects around the house. That doesn't include my 36 year old furnace, 40 year old water heater, or the myriad of cheap appliances that were out in when we moved in.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly, all IP law is regressive and counterproductive and overwrought as it stands, especially in the US.

Exclusivity should end after 5 years. Ill acknowledge you should be able to make money (only because we are all forced to one way or another) from your creative work, but creative genius can sustain increased unique output.

All current IP law does is encourage creative stagnation on every side of the issue.

Making a beloved character or artwork or movie is great. Creative people like creating. Give incentive to make more new things, not repeat the same things for decades to force purchasing.</div>

This is C&amp;D - specifically Caleb Miller, who is [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/INDYCAR/comments/mkzi1u/josef_newgarden_qaama/gtjpjmt/) and frequents this subreddit - not bothering to do do journalism by publishing a summary of [the work done by an actual reporter](https://www.thedrive.com/news/this-is-what-happens-when-hertzs-ai-scanner-finds-damage-on-your-rental).

The real reporter, Adam Ismail at TheDrive, asked Hertz this question specifically, and received a word salad from some shithead PR flack.  Can't fault a guy for trying, I guess.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Comparing humans to LLMs, large-scale pre-training is closer to evolution than it is learning.

While no human has read every book in the world, our collective ancestors have experienced just about every situation out there, and our genes have "learned"/optimized from those experiences through the process of natural selection (which is of course many orders of magnitude less efficient than gradient descent).

The learning that humans do during our lifetimes is probably more analogous to fine-tuning. Some internet sources say that a person will speak ~800M words in their lifetime, which is within an order of magnitude of the amount of fine-tuning data used for medium-sized open-source LLMs.

LLMs also of course have context windows and can do in-context learning, which I think is most equivalent to our short-term memories.

Of course these are just imperfect analogies.


&gt; still can’t came up with new stuffs

Google/DeepMind would disagree, given that their AlphaEvolve system based on LLMs was able to find new algorithms that were more efficient than what humans could come up with.</div>
