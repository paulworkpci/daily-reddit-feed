                                <div class="reply-body">“The British Guy” is Douglas Murray who is fairly big over here in the UK. He’s very outspoken and has shared some valid but also quite shitty views on things.

He’s feisty and argumentative and is like this most of the time, it’s what has brought him into the spotlight in the first place as he was one of the first alt-right figureheads in the UK that had both passion and could actually string a sentence together.

It is unsurprising that he rubbed Joe and Dave up the wrong way. He’s a hothead and nothing like the “Trump bro” characters Joe usually has on.

Also there’s a culture in Europe to frequently critique your own side to keep them in check, something that seems alien the other side of the pond.

It was refreshing to see a bit of a stir IMO even if he did come across as bit of an asshole (he often does).</div>

But he's just a comedian right? Even though Joe will reference Dave as one of the most knowledgeable people he knows regarding geo-politics when he has on actual comedian guests who don't touch that shit.</div>

It’s only been a day and a half so fingers crossed that they make contact soon.  I mainly just want to lend my brain power and technical knowledge to their cause…they can go out and rent any of the gear I own themselves.  Just seems like whoever is in charge of that department internally at Skywatcher could use a helping hand of sorts.
And yes…they really should be usi...</div>

The phone isn't the issue, and it's nothing to do with the "evil tech overlords". The issue is you haven't truly, deep down, decided to make a change. 

Don't get me wrong, phones are great for escaping reality, and social media apps (Reddit and Youtube included) are literally just built to fry your dopamine receptors 24/7, but it's not their fault. 

Before going to bed, it's so easy to psyche yourself up to change the next day, literally all you need to do is to not use your phone so much! But then when you wake up, you didn't have the best sleep, you have a bit of a headache, the house is a bit cold, life is hard etc etc, the only thing that will make you feel comfortable is feeding your current addiction (which is scrolling on your phone).

The only way to break away from it is to actually decide you're going to stop. You have to embrace the coldness and dullness of reality and fully commit to some short term pain for the long term gain. Nobody else can help you with this. Lockboxes, grey scale, app timers etc DO all work, but they only work if you decide that they're going to.</div>

I took it for quite the test drive over the last day, and it's amazing.

Code you explained 12 weeks ago? It still knows everything.

The session in which you dumped the documentation of an obscure library into it? Can use this info as if it was provided this very chat session.

You can dump your whole repo over multiple chat sessions. It'll understand your repo and keeps this understanding...</div>

The only thing is that it sometimes replies in green text format, probably because I buried OpenAI's server with like thousands of 4chan green text screencaps. Especially when I'm asking about a certain person á la "what stupid shit did trump today?". But I don't mind, because it's actually quite funny most of the time. https://imgur.com/a/1aNbJRm  "Congress's favorite CrossFit QAnon cosplay" I tought my chatgpt well!

So just try it out for a day or something? It's not exactly rocket science. If it behaves it behaves. If it's helpful for remembering important things than it's helpful. And if not, then nuke it.

95% of my interaction with ChatGPT is about dev work, so it is probably easier for my ChatGPT to not do stupid shit, but in the end you have to test it out yourself.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Possibly Zelenskyy himself, who by coincidence is also a career comedian that was very successful in Ukraine before becoming president. He asked to come on the show and was told by Joe "fuck you man. Fuck you people. You people are going to start World War 3."

  They lead with ego and anyone in their crew who might voice contradictory viewpoints is simply not fit to orbit them.  
  
  So then you come up on a couple decades of designing an extended network of sycophants and end up creating an entire parallel universe of biases that have become true by sheer repetition and ignorance.</div>

Sometimes, music works for me while writing. Mostly, I feel productive and motivational if I have a nice view. 

1. Quiet environment

2. Team collaboration

3. Task management tools

4. Coffee

5. Music, downtempo or maybe hardcore (why not)

6. Deep focus sessions (Pomodoro)

7. Deadlines

                        <div class="comment-body">I remember when instruct-002 was first released, It was a checkpoint among many checkpoints of ''feeling the agi" before chatgpt got mainstream or got released. It was so good, first time something shocked me for following simple instructions. Especially at what we had back then, it wasn't on the level of chat gpt-3.5 but it was close. Very promising territory back then, and it did create the series of what we have today.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Well text-davinci-002 felt close to GPT-3.5 because it was GPT-3.5, and it was extremely similar to the iteration of it that was named GPT-3.5 (for example text-davinci-002 got a 68 MMLU vs. GPT-3.5's 70, which is within the MMLUs error rate). It was a new pretraining run getting GPT-3 sized models to approximately Chinchilla level optimality (which was a 20:1 tokens to parameter ratio. GPT-3 was trained at approximately 300B tokens, GPT-3.5/text-davinci-002 would have been at about 3.5T). Of course the GPT-3.5 we are more familiar with had more instruction tuning and, newly, chat tuning which was the version that was put into ChatGPT (which was the larger difference between the two, and it's entirely possible they could have done some further training).</div>

The actor forgot to pull the trigger!", not, "Was this made by AI?" The 'normies' are pretty much perpetually *ages* behind on AI advancements. Even six months of advancements is practically an eternity in the AI space, in recent years. SOTA keeps improving, and the time between improvements keeps getting shorter.

Yann is the chief AI Scientist at Meta and this model was released on his watch. Even bragging about the lmarena scores:

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_good-numbers-for-llama-4-maverick-activity-7314381841220726784-8DUw


He was saying things like: https://youtu.be/SGzMElJ11Cc?t=3507 6 months **after** Daniel Kokotajlo posted: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6Xgy6CAf2jqHhynHL/what-2026-looks-like

Anyone who thinks the future AI systems are safe because of what he's said should discount it completely. He still thinks that LLMs are a dead end and AI will forever remain a tool under human control.</div>

Like I will never look at meta, yann or zuck with credibility on Ai again.

They clearly and knowingly lied. In a context where their lie would EASILY be found out in HOURS. like WTF.

Yann is supposed to be a serious guy. This is not the kind of thing serious people do if they want to be taken seriously.

Like if I EVER see another yann post on this sub again I will simply respond with Llama4 and move on.</div>

And I do believe that if we create digital biology, we will absolutely able to stop aging. It has been known to be biologically feasible (There are "technically immortal" creatures living on earth right now), so there's no reason we can't do it.

Also, pills would be pretty cheap to make once the formula is found. The whole healthcare system works to a single goal : To keep you alive. If there was a way to prevent aging, it would be given to everyone and it will drastically reduce the number of people in hospitals. On an economic perspective, it is way profitable to have only 20 year old people in your country than really old people needed to be taken care of at all times.

It is a really logical idea that will get funded and works under capitalism, even though AI would probably destroy that economic system anyway in the long run.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Quick personal experience with sleep hacking:

Works well:

* Take magnesium before bed.
* No screen 1h before bed.
* Avoid bright light, blue light 1h before bed.
* Vigorous exercice during the day improves sleep quality.
* Sunlight, bright light during the morning/day help your circadian rhythm so also improves sleep.
* Take glycine before bed.
* Always going to sleep at the same time.
* Waking up at the same time.
* First meal at the same time every day (it times other processes in your body with your circadian rhythm)
* No caffeine after lunch.  Reduce caffeine if you are a heavy consumer.

Has worked, worth a try:

* Not eating in the evening / smaller eating window.
* 1/2 tablespoon of honey before bed.
* If you have been heavily reliant on screens like me, use the last hour before bed to prepare for the next day. Prepare everything to remove the friction: your lunch, what cloth you'll wear, etc. If you need to plan, use pen and paper only, and keep that paper close or in view so that it will be one of the first things you see when you wake up.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not OP, but I have huge problems with procrastination, and it's related to emotional avoidance.  I need huge willpower to overcome the bad emotion when I am about to start a task, unless I reach the crisis / panic point where I have to work.

I have recently improved my sleep, I am starting to believe that sleep alone helps me with that emotional management.  Not with more willpower, just the emotion is easier to overcome.  Like sleep deprivation makes my procrastination worse because it amplifies the negative emotion and anxiety when I am about to start a task.

So yes, getting more sleep is more important than I tought.  In my case, going from 6.5h/7h to 7.5/8h is making a difference.  So, just an average 1h more, and I can feel it.</div>

The idea is to act with compassion but without getting emotionally hijacked by everything.

your brain’s not built to hold the whole internet  
scroll long enough and you forget which problems are even yours

protecting your peace isn’t selfish  
it’s survival  
you can still be kind, still be informed—just not *chronically plugged in*

most of what you see online is just bait for outrage  
you’re not a better person for letting it hijack your nervous system

log off  
zoom in  
build a life you can *touch*

Our IT guy caught me with a split screen where I had made each of my items I needed half of the screen so I could go back-and-forth, but I was still having to scroll a little bit and he was like you know I can get you another monitor. I was like oh my gosh, you can do that!  This was probably 15 years ago before everybody had them.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;Captain Samuel Vimes ‘Boots’ theory of socioeconomic unfairness.

“The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.”

I stopped going right after work, but I did not stop *saying* that I was going straight to the gym simply so that I change my clothes before leaving.

You would be SHOCKED how much less draining a commute (especially a long one) is when you’re not wearing a tight skirt, a scratchy blouse, or a Real Bra. Even more than the commute though, ...</div>

My old work had locker rooms so it was easy to change in, but my new office pretty much just has stalls in the bathroom that are frequently used. I have used the handicap stall to change in a couple times</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Depends how you're determining efficiency. A great bioweapon is one you can get people to take voluntarily and not know is a weapon, and even have people defending it and pushing for mandatory consumption of it. If it kills too quickly, it will be obvious what the source of the damage is and people will scramble to find a cure, as well as taking aim at the people who developed and deployed it.

  
If it's the case that the mortality rate of it starts out low, but then slowly grows over time until it reaches a tipping point where a decade down the line most people die from it without even knowing the real cause, is that really inefficient? If you have a 30-50 year plan to massively reduce population, you don't need to kill everyone immediately, you can setup multiple attack vectors with longer term TTK where the symptoms/effects are widely varied enough that the true sources that can be masked. 

The truth is we won't know the full scope of the damage done for many years to come, if at all.</div>
