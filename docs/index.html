                        <div class="comment-body">I work in construction myself and what is telling to me is that a lot of the new tech solutions basically are 3d printing walls and robot bricklaying. 

The bricklaying might be interesting but it is only one small part of the construction world

The 3d printing is telling to me that the people who come up with it are not construction people but people who think construction consists of building walls. See also the robot bricklaying 

3d printing a building might be useful in certain niche instances possibly in space. But I do not see how building this way would be better than the current automation technique of fabricating walls etc in a factory and assembling on site.

Having said that there is a lot of waste that happens particularly in materials and labour utilisation that imo is ripe for disruption. 

Robots though... come back to me when there is a robot electrician or plumber</div>

Maybe bricklaying or even wood framing robots or concrete slab placing robots and robot operated cranes be used to accelerate construction, but unless you're connecting pre-assembled modular prefab sections complete with all the wiring and plumbing, many specialist construction jobs will remain.</div>

This was the reason I first started mindfulness meditation a few years ago. I was trying my hardest to sit down for 20 minutes every single day. To be honest, it worked wonders in the first year. I became way less anxious and got a lot more patient and calm. I loved its effect.

Well, the past year was tougher. I experienced challenging events. The death of a loved one, my brothe...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Thank you so very much for this post. Exactly what I needed to read this morning. Yesterday I logged out of the most time consuming sites on my phone in an effort to break off my reliance/addiction to like never ever feeling present in the moment- always distracting myself from reality and what’s happening right now. It’s so uncomfortable in my own mind and body, I’m always looking for a way to escape it, but I remember and long for the time in my life when I felt comfortable and content being present. So that knowledge that it’s possible is motivating me to finding ways to be more mindful. I’ve been up for two days now, just unable to sleep despite being utterly exhausted. I’m wanting to escape myself and my reality so desperately that I’m not even able to relax enough into the moment and get the sleep I have been denying myself for… yikes 53 hours. So even though I deleted stuff from my phone yesterday, here I am on Reddit doing the same distracting behavior. But I’m really glad I found this post because I’m going to forgive myself for using my phone in a way that is very common, and I’m not going to continue to be mean to myself about it. I’m going to hold myself accountable with compassion instead of disdain, and even if I’m on my phone today that’s ok cuz I’m gonna do ONE THING , just one, differently, and that is going to be to watch this movie with my daughter. 
And maybe after that I’ll go to sleep ! Maybe.

Thanks so so much for the recommendation and for posting this. Perhaps I’m delirious but I’m going to roll with the optimism I’m feeling</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’m honestly really glad that this post helped you. Addiction is very tough to deal with and I can actually relate to you. 

I’m no expert in dealing with addiction but one advice that helped me immensely is don’t force yourself to lose an addiction in a day. It’s ABSOLUTELY FINE if you scroll reddit or whatever else. You just have to aim for being a tiny bit better each day and reading your comment it seems like you already know this, which is a huge first step. What you’re doing is perfectly fine. Be gentle with yourself. I had a stage when if I missed a day of meditation I always blamed myself. “You dumb f**k, why the hell did you play video games instead of meditating?”. Thoughts like this are very unhealthy and became a huge reason for me to stop my meditation routine. I also had to learn to forgive myself and once you accept it and just let go of the grip, life becomes much more gentle and kind. 

I hope you’ll like the movie and I wish all the best for you!</div>

Since then, the boundaries between “sacred” and “mundane” have gotten thinner and thinner. Agree that that’s the part that makes meditation worth it.</div>

Unfortunately, as far as creative writing, IMO the models I tested were standard levels of LLM bad, if not worse. That is just my opinion, though.

It's not GOD. But what used to take a series of back and forth prompts and thoughtful input/direction from you, is now done in one shot and the result is better than it would have been.

                                <div class="reply-body">You are lionizing coding too much, yes it helps all other tasks and can generate its own validations without humans, but solving coding won't solve other tasks by default. Every domain space is unique and requires its own experience loop. The only way to learn to improve a domain is by working on problems in that domain and collecting feedback on ideas from the outside environment.

In fact the feedback part is crucial. The nice thing about coding is that it can generate its own feedback by execution, especially running tests. In other domains you need to test ideas in reality, which limits the experience you can gather and how fast you can iterate. Hence the focus on coding - it's a lower hanging fruit. But the moral is that AI won't surpass humans in all fields at once, it depends on the rate limits of feedback systems.

What takes 1 second to test in software dev might take 3 months to test in biology. You can iterate a million times in coding while you iterate once in biology.</div>

I've personally just noticed that for a lot of the tasks that GPT-4 or even o3 struggles with, I can just switch over to Claude and just one-shot it. ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It depends on what you want from it, and what you expect from it. 

I subscribed to Claude Pro for the $20 plan (same as 20 EUR plan), and I was able to run it a solid 3 hours out of 5 with Sonnet 4. That doesn't mean they'll always keep it at that level, but that's my experience. 

The reason you might want to pay more is because you get access to Opus, but honestly it's not a lot of access. Sonnet 4 you can run for most of 5 hours on the $100 Max plan, but Opus stops fairly early on. I kept Opus on standby for harder issues. 

Honestly, I dislike the hardcore agent coding. I'd rather do build, file layout creation, most coding on my own. Claude Pro does a fantastic job, especially where I have limited knowledge, but I'd rather build the knowledge I need instead of having an agent do it all.</div>

I didn't use the autocomplete in either case as it was mostly a distraction, so I don't miss that with Claude Code. I think the console workflow helps me focus (the IDEs feel overwhelming to be honest), though one downside is I can't just paste screenshot results I need to save them to a file and save the file.</div>

For the record I train in CrossFit and have completed hyrox’s and love them both for different reasons so not hating on any but just thought it would have been funny for him to do so. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Honestly? It would be a fucking BRILLIANT marketing move. Get Hyrox to sponsor an event, do a hyrox race and build that relationship and help revamp crossfit's image. It's so perfect and so smart that you know Dave/Crossfit won't do it. Dave's ego is too big. At best he'll try to create his own "hyrox" style wod, but it'll have to have triple unders, one handed barbell snatches, and 300lb Turkish get ups because...he's Dave.</div>

His ego is the reason I think he *would* do something like this. He'd make it a spectacle to show how much more elite he believes Crossfit athletes are compared to Hyrox athletes. So much so that he would make Crossfit athletes do an entire Hyrox competition plus 10-12 more workouts over the course of a weekend.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Rather than be funny, it would actually be a very cool collaboration and promotion for both. I think CrossFit would need the collab more than Hyrox at this stage just in terms of hype and mass appeal tbh.

Big question I haven’t seen answered is how clean the code is. 

If it’s clean and it can do more than greenfield, things will get really cool fast.

Most quantum consciousness theories I've heard of also depend on interpretations of quantum measurements that invoke human minds in ways not justified by the actual experimentation. Roger Penrose is a brilliant man, but smart people are also really good at justifying their belief in dumb ideas.</div>

Even if we had a fully working quantum computer with unlimited computing. There is no quantum consciousness theory that could be tested on it. 

A really good analogy is that there is no classical consciousness theory that can be tested classical computers. 

Not that it's fundamentally not possible but there just aren't any theories developed enough to test.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt; In research published June 12 in the journal APS Physical Review Letters, the scientists demonstrated a quantum error rate of 0.000015%, which equates to one error per 6.7 million operations. This achievement represents an improvement of nearly an order of magnitude in both fidelity and speed over the previous record of approximately one error for every 1 million operations.

Are they being purposely confusing with an already confusing topic? This summary seems to only make what happened more impactful than it was? And citing 'world record achievement'? Of course any improvement is a world record achievement. Do journalists need to label each technical advancement in any industry a world record achievement?

If they must use the percentage, they could say "Scientists reduce quantum computer error rate from 0.000100% to 0.000015% error rate." or "Scientists reduce quantum computer error rate from 1 per million to 1 per 6.7 million."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's OSK regeneration of the optic nerve, and the company licensing it would have to be stupid or in on the scam itself.

As for being a treatment approach for 'aging', well. The treatment involves inserting a syringe into the eye for delivery. While that can turn out to be a viable approach for mending spinal cords and rejuvenating muscles, I don't particularly think jabbing people in the heart or brain with a needle will be all that great.

Let's just be impressed if it works on glaucoma. It'd be a big step for OSK if it works out, the kind of thing we'd hoped for since the Yamanaka factors were identified 20 years ago.

As for Sinclair himself, the first time I heard of this thing was in the middle of an interview where he casually dropped the claim that his lab cured blindness in old mice. I'm not being hyperbolic about this; I was a bit tuned out at the time since he was doing his regular 'eat some vegetables, take some supplements, and do some healthy living' schtick. Literally less than 10 seconds on FUCKING CURING BLINDNESS, sandwiched in the middle of ~10 minutes of the pill-hocking and feel-good hippy energy vibes.

I rewound the tape to see if he said what I heard him say. He said it. I was so baffled and frustrated: 'Why the hell aren't you talking for 10 minutes about **that**??' I had to go hunt down and read the stupid paper myself, like some kind of animal. Why even have videos if all you're gonna talk about is celery...

I dunno. Sinclair himself is a sales guy, but it doesn't mean the lab can't bungle its way into producing something. We'll see if it amounts to anything or not. It definitely won't be a cure for aging on its own contrary to the misunderstandings he's trying to create here, obviously.</div>

They're hoping to rejuvenate ailing RGCs in the optic nerve to restore vision in glaucoma and NAION. Every result they've published so far is incredibly promising, I expect big things here assuming it's not all just lies.</div>

They say even with the battery removed, some phones still transmit signals.

Has anyone seen this before or is it just internet paranoia?

                                <div class="reply-body">I realized just how capable they were around 2012 or 2013 when I was working at Verizon. One day, a guy came in asking for a basic flip phone. Nothing fancy, just something with a removable battery. He said he wanted to ditch his iPhone. Fair enough. But while we were dealing with slow activation systems, the conversation took a hard left. He started asking if I believed in God, which seemed random but harmless. Until it wasn’t.

He then tells me he’s on a mission from God. Not to spread the word, but to assassinate federal judges. Then he pulls out a paper with a list of 12 names, addresses, and even their work schedules. At that point, I’m trying to stay calm, excuse myself to grab a spare battery, and alert my manager. She immediately gets on the phone with the police.

But here’s the wild part. The police don’t show. They call back and tell us to contact the FBI hotline instead. Within an hour, the Feds are in the store. While reviewing the surveillance footage with one of the agents, I remember him casually saying, “Even if you turn off your phone, we can still track it.” That stuck with me. It was shocking back then, and I can only imagine how much more advanced it is now.

Unfortunately he died in federal custody like a year later, turns out he was special forces and had a esteemed police career before slipping into mental illness 🤷‍♂️</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Right. Why would he not go on vacation to a private island if he didn't know? It's just an island.

He's clearly lying over and over, but the truth is still squeezing out.

What's craziest to me is he could have just said "yeah I knew him, but he kept that part of his life secret for obvious reasons." But Nahhh. Deny, deflect, change the subject, blame others, call it fake.

It really needs to be studied how this man managed to con so many people for so long.</div>
