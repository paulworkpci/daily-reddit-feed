Do you think that the Patriot Act is something patriots should vote for?

The government loves to sneak in shit that erodes your rights. If you uncritically just look at the name, you're being manipulated.

Edit: I read the bill and some explanations for the no vote.
 
Essentially the Dem reasoning is that violent assault already means deportation, but that this law changes some definitions which could have unforeseen consequences.

It's like how in programming you don't want to change code unnecessary  because bugs can pop up.</div>

"Hey man, I was playing ThatNewGame and it's so much fun!"

But there comes a point where its seeking validation (social media likes, followers, trends, etc.) which is fake and it's just sad and pathetic. 

If you're not on social media and don't broadcast the highlights of your life, well done to you for being an actual person. And to the people who say "I just post to show my friends what I'm up to", you aren't just doing that- you're enjoying the fake validation. If you really wanted to show your friends what you're up to then you would message and have an actual conversation.</div>

For me it comes from a place of fear of messing up or making the wrong choice. Like somewhere along the way I lost the ability to just pick a class in a video game for example without googling is x class any good? n class or Z class? etc.Or with art I can't just find an art supply that has decent reviews I'll spend like an entire day picking out a mechanical pencil or whatever through endless youtube and reddit reviews. The worst thing is this doesn't even help that much because usually it's not actually that cut and draw and their are a ton of materials but I just feel this compulsion.

  
So like one of my resolutions with no surf is to try and let myself be experimental/spontaneous again with these sorts of low stakes choices like game characters or whatever because in addition to wasting time it sucks some of the magic out.</div>

Apparently its seems "illegal" to enjoy things. You have to like whatever thinks everyone should. Be it music, a show, a lifestyle, clothing

It was Starfield. And I liked the game because I like space, the relaxing vibe and somehow calm cozy type of game while having its own action

There are have been people at youtube tried to attack people who like the game. Sending them threats and shitposts. A troll brigade

Its one of the weirdest thing I've seen. Even forcing me to remove things I like on Facebook because some creepy people sending me messages and random comments why I like Starfield or Xbox or why I watch Snowpiercer</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Microsoft is is investing 80 billion in datacenters hardware every single year. I would assume that most of those AI 80 billion will be part of the datacenter expansion, so this might result in going from 80 billion to for example, 100 billion spent on datacenters. Not to take away from the article, but this is likely going from like 60 billion invested in AI in 2024, to 80 billion in 2025, so it should not be that much of a difference as people would expect.

It takes time for the revenue to come from the hardware you invest in to return, so it's understandable they will be taking their time. I'm sure in 2026 and 2027, the investments will be much bigger, especially as prices of hardware should go down a little bit by then, as new chip fabs will come online.</div>

He was so famous; people would literally pay random men to dress up as him for their parties....

I think people underestimate how difficult it is to know someone is a predator and that should be the real takeaway...

Here's another point of view: 

1 in 30 women are sexually assaulted every year. So at least one woman you know was raped or sexually assaulted in the last 12 months.

How many men do you know that have committed that crime? Because statistically you should personally know some... 

That's how difficult it is.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Well...agents, clearly. There's a LOT going on in agentic development. Being able to guide AI down a specific path can both improve it's thinking AND mitigate hallucinations, a lot.

There's at least 5 pretty good sized startups working on agentic workflows and probably 50 more I don't know about. With enough scaffolding built around it o3 will *absolutely* be able to do entire jobs that are currently filled by humans.

If you've worked with APIs and agentic workflows at all it's clear this is where the most obvious value will be delivered the fastest. The main roadblock right now is needing the reasoning models to go fully multimodal with an enormous context window. google allows some testing of multimodal with its reasoning model but still very small context.

I think in 2025 we get very large context in reasoning models with full multimodality. At that point, it's a swiss army knife that can be put into agentic flows almost everywhere.</div>

There was a thread here about Soros backing DA candidates, not because he plans to commit crimes across the country, but because he wants to see criminal justice reform. Guys like Elon are more interested in directly buying influence and making themselves richer. 

Elon is what they’d have you believe Soros is (again, not defending any billionaire throwing money into democracy, though). That’s why he’s so happy to paint that target on Soros’ back.</div>

The key to human identity has always been the human struggle (to survive, really). Society and technology has advanced since the discovery of fire to try to ease the human struggle. It was a very slow pace for hundreds of thousands of years that had rapidly picked up in the past couple thousand, even moreso in the past couple hundred, and even more than that in the past hundred (with stuff like the telephone/internet). 

If the singularity truly occurs, we are not just talking about easing the human struggle at a faster than ever pace, we might be talking about the complete eradication of the human struggle in the next couple of decades, by solving it in every way. 

What does it mean to be a human then?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">He is not wrong. Humans are weak at imagining anything other than very incremental change. That is why we were not prepared for covid. Only this New Years I was laughed at by a very smart person who is quite senior in the diplomatic service, for suggesting things are about to change very quickly and irreversibly. Until people begin suffering, likely through labour market disruption, no-one will take it seriously. Then, because we haven't thought about it, there will be panic. Hopefully it all works out okay in the end.</div>

I was talking to a colleague who dismissed the idea AI might reach human level (and beyond) in our lifetime. On the premise that current models are only as complex as 1 cubic cm of the human brain, so more than 1000 times smaller. Comparisons of brain vs silicon are futile anyway, but assuming that one is correct: With exponential growth of 2x per year 1000x is just 10 years away. Well within my lifetime.</div>

Let’s be serious, the U.S. government isn’t touching UBI for shit, especially not the incoming regime. But it will be amazing for the wealthy!

PS I had a random thought, could you hypothetically set up a bunch of GPTs via APIs to check each others work and come up with answers that are far better than standard? For example, a regular 4o reply generally is limited to a page or two of text as a reply. You’ll never get 10 page replies. 

Could you set up one GPT via API to answer one part over a few pages, another to do the same, on and on for 15+ page replies and then have another GPT essentially take all the replies and combine them (maybe it’s unaware that the replies are other GPTs), and then one last one does fact checking?</div>

Why should those actions ever be excused and the perpetrators ever be forgiving if they are never brought to justice, but are in fact celebrated for committing those acts within the country who is doing them?

Its disgusting and shows how out of touch Lex is as this point.</div>

Maybe he’s disconnected. Like the rich ppl that say detached stuff like “well if imported vegetables cost more due to tariffs, maybe people should just eat more corn🤨”

“It’s all love man, Putin is sending love bullets and bombs to take your people to the land of galactic love and freeing them with love away from this fleshy world, love”

                                <div class="reply-body">Zelenski was great, so there is a lot of value to be taken out of the interview to be honest. However, Lex was not. He was naive and kept saying that his dream would be for Zelenski, Trump and Putin to sit together at a table a negotiate peace. After so many repeated explanations of Zelenski on why that was literally and objectively impossible, Lex kept repeating, “yes, yes, but my dream is that you can all sit and through conversation and dialogue find a peace solution”. 

Putting conspiracy theories aside, it’s like asking an American after 9/11 that they would forgive Bin Laden.

Someone on youtube comments put it best: “I just saw 3h of an adult explaining to a child that unicorns do not exist”. Worst part if that the adult did a fantastic job at explaining it, with crazy levels of patience, but in the end the child, as naive as he is, still left the room believing in unicorns.</div>

Very important. True AGI should be able to ask *me* questions, and have its own volition. And it should be able to respond in real-time just like humans do. It should be able to respond immediately, mid-sentence even, because it knows what you're going to say, etc.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think what people don't get is the goal isn't the literal money, but creating something that can productively handle enough work in our current economy to generate 100 billion dollars autonomously.  

Yes, people are frequently greedy and focus on money, but what I mean is the 100 billion dollar goal aligns with the broader point about an AI's ability to do jobs. If an AI can perform jobs in our economy that generate money, it shows a non-human entity has proven value within our economic system.  

If the jobs it's doing seem nonsensical, that's a problem with our economy, not the AI. The idea is that if it can do economically viable things independently, it's showing intelligence by meeting our current metrics of usefulness and productivity.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">While this and the consequent comments are sounding the alarm, I for that matter do not care. MDH was caught not for heavy metal presence. It was due to the use of Ethylene Oxide which is a grade 1 carcinogen. The compound is widely used i. My country and hard to avoid for folks due to poor and corrupt regulations. Most people do not have the time or resources to care about these things. Hence it is trivial for them. (It is another thing if you have poor genes). 

Cassia cinnamon (coumarin for that fact) hasn’t proven to be causing cancer in humans. No peer reviewed research. Coumarin has only been linked in animal studies. And it is not like one is consuming truck loads of cassia. 

(Random) Artificial sweeteners causing cancer and ooga booga; one needs to consume like 15-20 cans of cola consistently over a long period of time to get affected by cansur. Yeah if you do, you have no life to begin with. 

People just keep yapping without knowing the nuances.</div>

This popped up in my algorithm on Instagram. Interesting take from a guy who looks like he knows what he talking about. I don’t know what to believe anymore. The Shawn Ryan podcast seemed like a legit place to get info but…maybe not. This whole “drone” thing is so weird.

In other words, it is a picture of a document in a document editor. It's pretty damning. imho, especially when you take on board the guy's history of fabricating documents to push his narrative. 

Fucking shameless frankly. 

I guess the significance of the JSON is that it proves that account is run by shoemate which if I'm not mistaken he never intended for anyone to know that. He created that account, and those documents and started pushing what is essentially Russian anti-ukraine war propaganda.</div>

1. Record your meeting with the voice memos app (works for Zoom on speaker too)
2. After it finished, hit the new speech bubble icon in bottom left for transcript
3. Copy/paste into ChatGPT with this prompt:

Like we'd know ahead of time and there would be one 3 hour block and you had to write a whole essay, start to finish. Exams were almost always oral, in front of the whole class. Teacher/professor would ask 2/3 questions and grade you based on your verbal answers. We had to listen in class, take notes and study from our books at home to be ready for those oral exams which depending on what level you were in were 2-3 times per subject per semester or just once at the end. For math we'd be called to my the board and had to show our work in the moment.  Some classes like for languages had little homework assignments but the stuff that really mattered was impossible to cheat on. The key though was that if you weren't prepared they actually failed you. 
I think the US should adopt this system. </div>

Whenever I get one of these long-winded answers like 'To deal with climate change, humanity will have to implement technological fixes, change consumption patterns, and carefully consider blah blah'.

Then I ask 'what are the chances of that actually happening?' and the answer will generally be '5% or less' or something like this.</div>

So far all I can get CGPT to do that in a meaningful way. Although I've not put much time into it yet.  Basically: it seems to  all be parroting the trends in their training material when it comes to this stuff. I mean, on very practical questions that's different, but on this angle of discussion I can't get much deeper than plattitudal answers and/or known vectors and drivers of change.</div>

Dystopia, within 50 years.  

Society is facing a range of escalating challenges such as climate change, political polarization, wealth inequality, and rapid technological disruption. These trends, if unmanaged or poorly addressed, could erode individual freedoms, exacerbate social divides, and ultimately create a more dystopian reality. While some technological and social advancements foster hope for progress, the imbalance of power and the unchecked impacts of these challenges might prevail—leading to increased surveillance, limited autonomy, and social fragmentation over the next five decades.  

Nonetheless, nothing is set in stone; proactive measures, responsible policymaking, and collaborative efforts can steer us away from this trajectory. The most important factor will be how society collectively chooses to respond to these issues in the near future.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There are a lot of talented people in prison. Artists who can draw sexual pictures are popular. 

There are genuinely nice, decent people in prison who just did stupid things.

Prison is damn noisy.  24/7.

You get used to having no privacy/using toilets in front of cell mates or having officers see you shower.

Many inmates abuse the medical system to get strong painkillers like Lyrica or other drugs which can give a high if taken in larger doses.   

There are good education opportunities in prison if you avail of them. Some inmates even get limited access to laptops to do open university courses etc (no internet).   

Lifers get more perks than temp prisoners.  They have nothing to lose really, so they are kept happy. 

Some prisons have Netflix etc.  No choice as to what they put on, but still...

Some prisons even allow old xBox 360 or PlayStation 2 consoles. 

Trusted prisoners often work as counselors and get training by The Samaritans. They save lives by helping prisoners cope, especially new prisoners. Suicides happen maybe once or twice per year.

Prison becomes normal very quickly.  You get used to the restrictions and just get on with it. 

You only reform if you really want it. Being in prison itself doesn't make it happen. Prison honestly isn't a good solution. For every person that comes out better, 10 come out worse, and with no fear or prison and better criminal knowledge/connections.

Going back to work after getting out from a long sentence is hard.  You get used to being lazy and surviving on little money. You kinda reject societal norms once that society has punished you so severely by taking years of your life.

Ireland BTW.</div>

There are also hierarchies and you better respect them. Most of the time people get along very well (because starting a fight can get you killed real fast)</div>

One of the cohorts in our jury was a judge in another small town, who had been a CO some years back. He said everything is for sale in there and everything is negotiable. We had to watch a lot of security camera footage, and it didn't look anything like I imagined in there. I was stunned by how many people get caught bringing in contraband on visiting days.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The rape issue, while not non-existent, is way less IRL than in the movies. I was in for 2 years, and it never happened once, in either prison. There's the odd tale told by lifers about "this guy 10 years ago" or "i knew a guy in a different jail", but it's not common.

You can roll your eyes and walk away from almost any aggressive asshole, but if you run, you're gonna get lit up. What you say can get you dabbed up in your cell. 

It's illegal to smoke in prisons in my country, so they have nicorette gum. They're sold in "sleeves", and go for $5/sleeve. That's inside currency. Transfers will cost you $90 for 10 sleeves. That's when they get someone on the outside to send money to your outside account, and you buy sleeves inside for them.

Cards are king. Canasta and Big 2 were the games of choice in one prison. The other one had a Bridge table i joined.

Don't ask, don't tell. The guy running around talking about how he's in on a body is a liar. He's definitely a deflecting sex offender. The guys who are in on bodies are lifers, and don't need to tell you why they're in.

Generally, you don't fuck with people, they won't fuck with you. Guards don't care, but they ain't gonna give you grief if you don't give them any.

And the name of the game is patience. There's certain things you can put in requests to purchase, like Discmans and a fan. Expect to wait 3 months. They'll order it in a few weeks, it'll arrive a week after, and it will sit in V&amp;C for 2 months before they open it and give it to you. Harass them, they'll put it in property, and you can have it when you're released.

Other than that, Penn packs and boredom.</div>
