I haven't found a source for "For the first time ever," though.

Worth noting: His brother *was* in the office and did die.

Also, [this man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Lutnick) is Howard Lutnick and he isn't in the "shadows" or "staying quiet". He's literally the current U.S. Secretary of Commerce and was a well-known fundraiser for Trump's 2020 and 2024 campaigns.</div>

"Howard Lutnick, Cantor's chairman and chief executive, survived only because he arrived at work later than normal, having taken his son to his first day in senior school."

[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5282060.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5282060.stm)

edit the article says senior school but seems his oldest son was born in 1996, so 5 at the time. That really could be his first day of school.

Its those dramatic extra details that turn people off of conspiracies, as well as what debunkers like to use to invalidate your whole argument.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">To be clear, the reason why AGI can be a race is because there's an implied level of capability for some projected AGI technology that **enables the party who reaches it to wipe out its competitors**. This need not be militarily even though autonomous drones and automated weapons research are a frightening possibility. Economically destroying a a competitor or using persuasion/wireheading to weaken the productivity of its workers are also threats. Or deploying such vast AGI-enabled efficiencies to benevolently outcompete competitors into irrelevance and multiplying any research and economic lead into an insurmountable advantage by virtue of exponential take-off.

The implicit danger of this possibility is why AGI is a national security priority. The finish line is if and when the lead is so large the leader can cement its dominance for perpetuity.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">To be clear, his whole point is that there’s no such delineating finish line where you have a “before this day we didn’t have AGI, after this day we did”, no definitive moment when someone will have won the “AI race” for good and forever, and that the debate on AGI is a distraction that only interests non-technical folks.

So pretty much the opposite of everything you’re saying here.

Opening the training tooling is open source.

What this is, is a strategy to de-value/increase risk for American AI institutions, that run on investment capital. Making that risky chokes the capital investment (at least, the “smart money”). Dangerous to invest when China might make a competitive model free, right?</div>

The problem is that unlike CUDA literally nothing works on SYCL, and even the stuff that is supposed to work like llama.cpp has random errors (the graph optimization has been broken since it was implemented) so you’re only squeezing out 30-50% of the actual card’s technical performance.

Interestingly enough, the CUDA equivalent for those Chinese Moore Threads GPUs (MUSA) was implemented by a MThreads employee even though even fewer people are interested in that since the performance is on par with Nvidia's 10 series cards. Meanwhile Intel is drowning in whitepapers and has contributed basically nothing to the open source AI community besides releasing a hacky outdated version of TensorFlow and PyTorch.</div>

All they need is a short audio clip (like from a TikTok, podcast, or voicemail), and they can generate a fake “urgent call” asking for help or money. These calls feel very real the voice sounds just like your spouse, your child, or your friend.

                                <div class="reply-body">That's Level 1. That is just to prove that the person you're talking to is indeed the person you know. To up the level, have another password to also convey whether they are not safe. Imagine a scenario where they are really kidnapped and by providing that un-safe password, you know that the person is indeed your family member AND also not safe to convey to you that they are in danger.

I generally do not like the use of password but rather on question that only they know the answer to. This means they don't need to remember a specific made-up word. The correct answer can also be no answer. For example, ask what the name of the snake pet when you don't have a snake in the first place. Ask for specific attributes of an items.</div>

"Doing the laundry"? Hardly. Show me collecting clothes from bedrooms, assessing what needs to be washed, sorting into lights/darks/colors, show me adding detergent and selecting the right wash program, show me removal and putting in to dryer, show me folding and putting away. 

THAT is "doing the laundry", not this, whatever this is.</div>

It represents the pinnacle in autonomous humanoid systems, and is very impressive to robotics engineers, and very unimpressive to the consumer. 

It’s not a consumer product, and, like you, I don’t think it’s accurate to say “this is doing the laundry”. It’s a shame that humanoids get so overhyped. The actual progress we’re making is amazing, but it totally pales in comparison to the progress posts like this imply we are making</div>

I don’t even know if this is actually the robot doing it vs some guy piloting it for $2/hour. 

If all it’s doing is moving laundry in and out the machine then it’s practically useless. That’s literally the easiest and fastest part of the entire process. We are missing the other 90% of the “washing the laundry” process which is far more involved.

I’ll do the soy facing when it’s doing all of it while I’m at work.</div>

You're describing a "code along" session between junior devs and an AI copilot instead of a more senior team member. Sounds great. We've been doing that for years now.

A junior dev can solve simple problems, but cannot independently build and ship an entire project from start to finish no matter how much AI spits at them. They don't know how to do it. That's what the more senior team members are there for who delegated these simple tasks to them. If they can solve more, faster, great. If they themselves can someday become reviewers of individual parts of it before it gets to us, even better. But we cannot actually delegate an entire, real project of any complexity to an AI model. It is incapable of resolving business requirements to a complete product without many iterations and many humans in the loop.</div>

People are *hopeless* and will get the freight train straight to their face.

My advice is, be smarter than them and actually learn how to work with a team of AI agents. Conceptualize what regular developers can't because they are caught in the "stupid next token predictor" mindset. 
Learn advanced red teaming with a side of psychology. Learn team management. How to proficiently orchestrate a hybrid team of humans and AIs with different competencies. Be updated with research and leverage all the knowledge people are too lazy to gather.

In the rest of your time, enjoy life and cultivate any talent it gave you, regardless if it gives you money.</div>

* First prompt: This is ACTUAL Magic. I am a god.
* Prompt 25: JUST FIX THE STUPID BUTTON. AND STOP TELLING ME YOU ALREADY FIXED IT!

I’ve become **obsessed** with this problem. The longer I go, the dumber the AI gets. The harder I try to fix a bug, the more erratic the results. Why does this keep happening?

So, I leveraged my connections (I’m an ex-YC startup founder), talked to veteran Lovable builders, and read a bunch of academic research.

Sometimes I forget myself and a couple of days ago this led me down an hour long adventure trying to get Claude to fix a bug. After about 20 rounds of unsuccessful modifications, it simply disabled the faulty module and everything that calls to it and said something like “this should clear all your debugging errors and allow the program to compile correctly.” - yeah, thanks</div>

If you're coding in a chat interface copy-pasting code, you deserve what you get. 

Your problem descriptions need to be a proper QA analysis. You need to specify exactly what changes were made that caused the issue, what happens when you do this or that, and test as many variables as possible. "It doesn't work" tells me nothing. If a tester's only feedback to my submitted commit told me that "it's not working" I would fire them immediately.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The original research used GPT-4, but I expect it to generalize to newer models. I'd be curious if you disagree.

The original study was done using the HumanEval benchmark. It's taken from high-quality open-source repositories on GitHub. The bugs include quite detailed descriptions of the bug itself, how to replicate etc. Seems like proper QA analysis to me!

  
Then the AI gets some unit tests that it can run to see if a proposed solution has worked or not. The AI doesn't get much additional feedback between each attempt, although it's not clear to me what feedback we'd want the AI to have.

All of the academic work has issues with real-world applicability becuase the benchmarks are a bit artificial, but this one does pretty well IMO.</div>

Zuckerberg: Hello stockholders, Board of Directors. I'm excited to announce that we are creating a powerful artificial being, beyond our control, capable of eradicating all of humanity. Will it help improve our products? No. Will it make our entire economic system obsolete, rendering your stock portfolio irrelevant? Probably. Will it improve society? Frankly, it's going to do whatever the hell it wants. The important thing is, we're going to do it anyway.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree if he’s talking to the board of directors, but the post is referring to what he says when talking to the people he’s trying to recruit.

I don’t know about you, but if I wanted to try and steal the greatest minds from the likes of OpenAI and DeepMind, while also offering them millions of dollars in salary and compensation, it’s really not encouraging that the best he can pitch to them is “join us and we can improve Reels” versus “join us and we can completely revolutionise society as we know it, cure diseases, and push the envelope of science and humanity by building super intelligence”.

The fact he isn’t pitching potential employees the latter, and is instead talking about Reels of all things, shows he lacks serious vision (at least right now).</div>

Most consumer devices you buy from brands that you actually recognize (meaning not the sketchy Chinese crap) are Underwriters Laboratories (UL) listed.  Specifically, UL 2056 for power banks and UL 110 for mobile phones. Part of nearly every UL standard is to ensure your phone or power bank won't explode when heated. Or in this case - kept under the covers of a bed. 


I dont know the above two standards that well, but to meet UL 916 at work we heat our new products to 70C in an oven to make sure they don't catch fire, and apply 3KV transients to the inputs to make sure they don't explode as even a single spark will disqualify us from meeting the standard. Something similar is probably done for phones and power banks.


So is your phone or power bank going to catch fire if you charge it under the bed? As long as it's from a brand you've heard of, it's very unlikely. Now SHOULD you charge your phone under your bedsheets every night? Probably not. It does marginally increase the risk of fire, but more importantly it also kills your battery over time. Lithium ion batteries hate being hot, and burying a battery and some DC to DC power conversation circuitry under an insulator will shorten it's lifespan. Safety hazard or otherwise.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly. All phones have dozens of internal temperature sensors, and charging speeds will slow or stop if the phone is getting top hot, and will resume as soon as temps drop. If you charge your phone under a pillow, all that will happen is that it'll take 2.5 hours to charge instead of 1.</div>

This is the worst bit imo, they filed egregious charges even considering their vague criteria for inspection, and then considered it goodwill when they chose to waive said charges. 

I hope lucid hasn't entered the startup phase where they have to turn a profit and start to rent seek in an effort to turn profitable. Surely the saudis will want a return on investment at some point</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think Rogan loves Burr too much to let criticism of his show ruin their friendship. As much as i disagree with Rogan on politics, he seems like a pretty decent friend and not one to let politics fuck things up.

And if anyone can get away with (rightfully) calling out Rogan for his soft-ass cushy trump interview, it's burr.

Id love to see him on, hopefully soon.</div>
