Well, first I would like to say that I don't know if I put the right TAG. I found the new Tag options terrible. 


Lol. 


Second, I just found this on twitter. I don't know who this whistleblower is. Jesse Michel was the one who interviewed him:


"🚨🚨NEW FIRSTHAND UFO WHISTLEBLOWER


Randy Anderson is a Green Beret and an American Hero. In March of 2014, he was taken to an underground facility at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane in Indiana to a secure secret compartmentalized facility titled “Off World Technology”. He was shown an orb levitating above a podium and a "gauntlet" emitting holographic, hieroglyphic-looking text. This second object reportedly killed the person retrieving it. I have back-channeled with Navy contacts who say that while Wright Patterson reverse engineers the Air Force’s most exotic retrieved technology, Crane does this for the Navy.


Randy also STILL occasionally works contract jobs at Area51 and has seen “electrogravitic” antigravity triangle-shaped craft flying around the test site.


Randy’s credentials are beyond reproach: we have his DD214 as evidence of his service and his weapons training certificate from Crane proving he was stationed there. The implications of this interview cannot be overstated. Although in many ways (as he’ll admit), it begets more questions than answers. If anyone has had similar experiences or can add ANY insight on what Randy saw, please reach out to me or 
@UAPGERB
 (who introduced me to Randy) and is the best up and coming UFO researcher in the world right now. Go follow him. He’s going to be releasing some mind-blowing information in the coming months and years.


On a final note, I want to say that I had to personally convince Randy to do this — he was reticent to come out at all and extremely vigilant around not doing or saying anything here for self-gain. In fact, there was a section of my monologue dedicated to discussing his deployments and sacrifice for the country on the battlefield — he wanted that taken out. If we get any blowback for this piece (which I’m sure we will), it should be directed solely at me. Full episode in reply below." [Link](https://x.com/AlchemyAmerican/status/1878951513110052929)

A regular team guy is NOT going to be doing this stuff. A fair number of guys retire and move onto working paramilitary (ground branch) for the CIA, or security for DOE. This guy isn't claiming any of those. 

I'm going to do check on this guy and see if anyone knows him, either way.</div>

He then references Michael Herrera as a "good friend of mine" whom he connected with on social media. If this guy is / was an actual SOF guy there is no way in hell he would associate with someone like Herrera who was a deserter from his first deployment. Herrera's team leader already did an interview on Vetted where he 100% calls out Herrera for making the entire story up.

I call 100% bullshit on this.</div>

While lying in bed in a comfortable position, clench your fingers and toes for 10 seconds, then relax for 10. Repeat half a dozen times.

Very quickly I lose the count (during the relaxed period) because my mind has switched off. Soon after that I'm asleep.

Try it - I hope it works for you!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">As someone who also used to have issues with falling asleep, here's a similar technique that works really well for me and doesn't require physical clenching (since that doesn't work for me personally):

Take a few slow, deep breaths. Then start by mentally saying to yourself, slowly, "My left leg is heavy, relaxed, and warm." Say this **three times** and really focus on every sensation you feel in your left leg. Then do the same for the right leg. Slowly move up your body, repeating the phrase three times for each body part. (For stomach and chest, you can remove the word 'heavy'. E.g., "My stomach is relaxed and warm"). I'm usually asleep before I can get to my head! 

If you need helping getting started, the Honest Guys on Youtube have a meditation that guides you through it.</div>

[memory layers] also match the performance of MoE models that have the same compute budget and parameter count.

This is a terrible writeup, the paper makes a much stronger claim:

&gt; In many cases, memory augmented models can match the performance of dense models that have been trained on 4x more compute. They also outperform mixture-of-experts architectures with matching compute and parameter size, especially on factual tasks.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Wow. Being harsh on an admin is one thing - blatantly ass-kissing the incoming is another. This go around, corporations clearly understand the transactional nature of Trump and are acting accordingly...

---

**edit:** I prompted O1 with the text of the press release and asked it who it thought the author was:

"Putting all those clues together—the laudatory references to the “first Trump Administration,” the harsh critique of Biden’s policy, and the campaign-style language—**this press release was almost certainly written by Donald Trump’s team or a close pro-Trump political/advocacy group**. It reads very much like a statement from the Trump campaign or a Trump-aligned political organization rather than an independent industry association or neutral entity."

---

**edit:** Updated O1 chat. Asked "If I told you this was an official press release by nVidia corporation - what is your read on the situation?"

O1: "If someone claimed this was officially from NVIDIA, you’d be justified in questioning its authenticity. It doesn’t read like a standard corporate communication and would represent a sharp departure from NVIDIA’s usual, more measured style. It’s far more reminiscent of a political or advocacy group’s talking points than a Fortune 500 company’s press release.

In short, this text would be extraordinarily unusual—almost suspect—if attributed to NVIDIA. If you actually encountered it being circulated under NVIDIA’s name, the safest move would be to confirm through NVIDIA’s official channels (the corporate website, recognized press contacts, or SEC filings) before concluding it is genuine."

                        <div class="comment-body">I gave chatgpt the text of the article and asked it to write an unhinged left wing critque of this policy. Here ya go:

Oh, look, the U.S. government has decided to slap a shiny “AI safety” sticker on its plan to hoard tech, screw the global south, and call it leadership. This isn’t about safety—it’s a corporate-backed imperialist power grab dressed up in buzzwords. No ethics, no worker protections, no democratic oversight, just a big ol’ “trust us” as they hand AI over to the same companies that gave us mass layoffs and surveillance capitalism. And "U.S. allies only"?! Translation: rich countries get the goods, the rest of the world can eat dirt. This isn’t a policy—it’s a roadmap to a techno-feudal hellscape where a handful of elites profit while the rest of us live under AI-powered oppression. Tear it up and try again, but maybe this time with less corporate bootlicking and more actual humanity.

Is it wrong?</div>

Hearing all this further confirms that the rise of conspiracy theorists is because our world is becoming more and more complicated. A lot of how the world works is like a black box. You can no longer just open something or talk to a neighbor to learn how something works. So lazy entitled dumbfucks resort to conspiracies to confirm their beliefs rather than putting in the work to understand things</div>

There’s no water delivery system on the planet capable of dealing with that kind of fire. That’s why they move to containment as opposed to fighting house to house. There would be no point in funding and creating a system to do that because simply there is no demand for it. 

It would have been much more cost effective to build those homes to withstand firestorms. 

If Musk wanted to help he would be donating to relief efforts or housing the displaced, but that doesn’t gain votes for the Republicans so 🤷‍♂️</div>

I was talking with one of em yesterday about the fire and how no normal system is designed to suddenly fight a huge literal wildfire in a major city, but he's convinced it's the liberals that caused all this destruction thanks to cutting the fire departments budget. I then said "Wait, I thought cutting budgets and slashing departments was a good thing." to which he said "its good when the departments are wasteful".

How does that actually work?  How is the money actually being laundered and for what purpose? Why does tax payer money need to be laundered?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It works like this: someone opposes foreign aid but doesn't understand global politics enough to articulate a good reason why. That person then looks for something, but without understanding they have to settle on something else they don't understand like money laundering. It's the same reason so many conspiracy theories revolve around the Fed: because people don't know what it is or understand monetary policy.</div>

But he's not worried because clearly AI is affecting the world much less than he thought years ago when he talked about mass technological unemployment and massive societal change... Because he has AI smarter than himself in o3 and nobody seems to care.

I think his reasoning is pretty off on that.</div>

When those weaknesses are overcome, it will be like adding the throttle pedal to a kit car. It didn't move fast before the final addition, but it leaves everyone in the dust afterwards.

Note that I’m saying *possible*, it would still take a ton of safety testing before any public release, not to mention how expensive it would be at first so it wouldn’t be economically viable to serve to the public until costs can be brought down. Even then, it would be heavily neutered just like the most popular AI tools we have today.

                <div class="post-content">23F, been working at my first “big kid job” for almost a year now. Standard 9-5 computer work, microsoft excel type of job. A bit dull at times, but overall, I’m very happy, care about what I do, and want to do well at my position. My problem is that, no matter what, I always seem to get SO drowsy and on the verge of dozing off during meetings. My issue is that I tend to be the “least important” team member in many of these meetings, so I’m not directly contributing, and just listening. I’ve tri...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">And if transcribing isn’t enough, make sure you’re actually trying to process the notes in stride and highlighting the parts you can’t define. As a junior, there’s usually at least some terminology being thrown around that you don’t follow (especially if it doesn’t pertain to your specific tasks) that you could keep yourself more mentally engaged if you’re trying to make sure you truly understand everything. 

For what it’s worth, full on transcription of notes helps by making nearly everything searchable. It was nice being able to dig back 6 months to double check something on a project (though now Teams has the capability of transcribing everything for you automatically). 

I’ll be honest though, I still have the same problems on occasion much later in my career, but by now I’ve become more comfortable explicitly announcing “I need to drop” immediately after my piece is done. There’s a weird point where you transition from being the junior that feels like you need to just “push through” it all for the sake of image, to becoming more confident with the fact that if you’re not mentally engaged, it’s probably because you don’t need to be there.</div>

When I had those issues I’d chew gum, take notes, doodle, stand occasionally on spot to stretch my legs/spine. Drinking water even if not thirsty.. Maybe quietly tap your toes on floor.

                        <div class="comment-body">Well firstly do you sleep enough? Being 23, you may be prioritizing other things over sleep. Second, try not eating carbs, it leads to a rapid spike in blood sugar followed by a crash. Once I stopped doing that, I was fine. Also incorporate a lot of protein/fiber in your meals if you do that, it'll make you feel more satiated.</div>

What also helps a lot is to give yourself things to do even if you're not expected to actively participate in the meeting. Like other people say take notes. But maybe even better, try to figure out the dynamics between people. Look at the room (discretely) when someone is speaking. See who agrees, see who exchange glances. See when certain people start writing/typing. This might help your falling asleep problem, it will certainly pay of over time with the information you gather.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Third to this… although I wouldn’t be scared of carbs completely, just be smart with your consumption. If you are having a carb heavy meal, your sugar shall spike which shall then cause a crash (feeling sluggish, sleepy). Find a nice fibrous snack to have before hand; nuts, popcorn, avo on toast etc. 
look up the Glucose Goddess 😁</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The last season of GOT killed off interest in that show in such a dramatic fashion that it's really hard to comprehend. It was the center of the most TV show discussions for years, the benchmark for the new golden era of high production value TV shows. And then within about 6 months it was as if it didn't exist anymore. The only people talking about it were super-fans who were complaining on the internet and people worried that the books were never coming out. 

I live in Northern Ireland and we had a small tourist boom based on Game of Thrones since a lot of it was shot here. They even were constructing a GOT museum/ experience when the last season hit. I think it's open now but I couldn't tell you the name of anyone I know who has been to it. There were multiple tours, travel organisers and companies making replica props etc. Now it's 99% gone.</div>

In March of 2014, he was taken to an underground facility at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane in Indiana to a secure secret compartmentalized facility titled “Off World Technology”. He was shown an orb levitating above a podium and a "gauntlet" emitting holographic, hieroglyphic-looking text. This second object reportedly killed the person retrieving it.

                                <div class="reply-body">Let's say that immediately after he interviewed: His security clearance was abruptly terminated, and he was fired from all contract jobs around Groom Lake. 

That can be used as confirmation that something he said, was true. 

However, if nothing happens to him: There's even more ambiguity and room to sow doubt and weave a narrative to discredit him.

Agree with the oligarch that we tend to anthropomorphize, and his take on functional factors of humans vs. factors of machines is interesting.   
  
I disagree that bounded intelligence like we have now is perfectly bounded and incapable of behaviors like deceit, jail-breaking, and various kinds of harms. Initially he claims there's no will or consciousness, as though this has been his working belief, and then moments later he's arguing that the will and agency is limited by the cost of compute.</div>

The lying and jailbreaking that's been observed from multiple different models recently has been predicted by the experts for decades, along with what happens in the next few years as these models get even more capable:

[https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html)

If you're going to make something that has serious risks (some of them surprising and counter-intuitive), this level of evasion/downplaying is inexcusable.

Other teams are at least taking the dangers of what they are attempting seriously.

Meta and OpenAI are out here tossing radioactive material around and saying "we're still a long way from making a bomb with this. People who are saying it could theoretically be used to make a bomb so big it could level a city!? They don't get it, they're just anthropomorphizing"</div>

Yes, we conflate intelligence with ambition. 

No, AI will not naturally want to use its superior intelligence and processing speed vs humans. 

That is something for sure we are for the most part anthropomorphizing. 

But the question is, if even another human deploys an AGI for its nefarious purposes, what’s to stop it in executing the task and being able to do so very soon given the pace of development. 

The last part of this segment Zuck had no clue how to deflect that. Because there are no guardrails against human ambitions for more.</div>

It's a toy example and nothing was actually at risk but it's worth considering for when these models are deployed in the real world and by less scrupulous/careful actors. When we have models that are as smart and competent as o3 that can be run for a few thousand dollars by anyone in their basement things will get a lot more dicey.</div>

Since the global economy is almost entirely premised on humans selling their labor for money, humans would no longer be producers of goods and services in exchange for money and therefore would not be consumers of goods and services in exchange for money.</div>

Phi-4 benchmarks seemed fantastic, however many users encountered weird or just wrong outputs. Since I maintain the open-source project called '[Unsloth](https://github.com/uns...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">By the way we uploaded all the models publicly to Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/unsloth

If you'd like to run the model you'll only need about like 12GB of RAM (CPU RAM not GPU VRAM), so if you have a potato computer, this model can definitely run on there locally (if you use 4-bit or 2-bit versions).

You can also fine-tune Phi-4 completely for free on Google Colab which we made a notebook for [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Phi_4-Conversational.ipynb).

And if you're a beginner and want to learn how to train your own custom LLM, hopefully our documentation will help: https://docs.unsloth.ai/</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Good question. I think in general this issue of bugs have actually happened to nearly every company out there including Meta, Google etc. so it isn't exclusive to Microsoft.

Usually the error happens when the uploaders don't test their models well enough before they ship live because they're rushed or just did not check thoroughly enough.

But regrading copilot and their rag project I'm not sure.</div>

That’s at least the reason for Forge/AiStudio and the Copilot Studio. 

Half baked models are the norm tho. They are research products made to test certain theories (with the Phi models it is about how good you can make models with training them on synthetic data). Research has always zero budget but full on time pressure so you skip everything unimportant like usable context length or QA or actual readable code. That’s why research code often looks like someone puked out spaghetti but well, sometimes it’s spaghetti that will change the world (the og transformers code for example). Not many devs can say that about their code so thanks anyway 🙏</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Sometimes I wonder if all the insightful people were successful at getting off Reddit.

I remember how the sub was 5 years ago and it's a shadow of it's former self. I recommend any new lurkers try sorting by Best of All Time so you can check out some of the older posts.

One of those posts is called "A Life Wasted" where iirc they mention how scrolling takes away time from hobbies and life. That's why I consider it an informal addiction, because people continue to do it even when it is negatively impacting their life and they want to stop. 

I've been trying to gather my favorite points and sharing those. One that helped was learning to be kinder to myself. When I'm more upbeat I'm less likely to doom scroll. I still have my weak points, I still scroll Reddit and post sometimes.

Another thing that helped was having creative outlets. It makes me want to post on Reddit less because I could be putting that energy towards my own audience rather than a site that will stop talking about the topic in 1 day.

I still kind of hope traditional forums have a revival, as I miss the long term discussion they provided. A single thread could have hundreds of pages of discussion over years, instead of 1 post with 3 comments. lol</div>

                <div class="post-content">A couple of years ago, I was in a full-on brainrot spiral. Every night, I’d scroll mindlessly through TikTok until 2 AM, my head buzzing with random memes, half-baked life hacks, and drama I wasn’t even involved in. My partner would gently nudge me, “Hey, maybe try reading something before bed?” But instead of taking the hint, I’d laugh it off and keep scrolling. My attention span was fried, my anxiety was sky-high, and I was convinced I was doomed to this low-key chaos forever.

But how do you get to that point? To establish a routine you do need to have repetition and some willpower to initially make it a habit. I don't seem to get to the point that it becomes a routine. For instance: I will journal every day for 10 days straight, then the 11th day something happens and I forget and BAM I forget I was ever journaling. Then 2 weeks later I remember again. I have to start over and this repeats itself.

Putting it in a visible place didn't work either, since I'll accidently put the stuff away or in another place during cleaning or searching something else and then the journal stuff is not in sight anymore.

This is how every attempt to good routines/ habits has gone up till now. Even though I know about changing the environment to make things easier or harder and trying to chain behaviours to each other.</div>

Look for resources for people with ADHD, because if you have it it's a lot harder to form habits.</div>
