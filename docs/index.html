- Labor is the one bit of power the working class has over the ownership class &amp; economy.

- As more jobs get automated away with AI, jobs become more competitive driving down the cost of labor. Resulting in more people competing for less jobs, providing more power to the ownership class.

- Soon (1-5yrs, which is optimistic given current rates of improvement) we'll reach a critical threshold where human labor holds little power over the economy. Where choosing ...</div>

And I am not saying they are correct for believing UBI makes people lazy, as small scale experiments imply it is likely the opposite, but at the very least we should be intellectually honest that they were not talking about a scenario where nobody could earn money anyways. 

There would be no concern about people being "unproductive" in a post-AGI world if the AGI can do everyone's job anyways.</div>

People need to mobilize while we still have meaningful leverage. Check out Yanis Varoufakis and Gary Stevenson (Gary's Economics) if you want to dive deeper into this analysis - they've been explaining exactly this dynamic between AI, automation, surveillance capitalism and worker power for years, with solid economic backing.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</div>

What exactly is the 'general strike' intended to do? Who is its supposed to pressure, and what is the intended goal?

If its to pressure the government, why not just vote? 100x easier to get someone on board to vote, than to strike. 

All a general strike will accomplish, is strongly and massively encourage business adoption of AI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Survival. You dont really get it, look at homeless people in your area, see how much they matter, to you and to the government. 

In the next few years the labor force will shed multiple sectors. Those that lose their jobs will not see help, they will have to funnel into any low skill commercial activity, a market that will be saturated, whatever pays for food and rent. Those that can’t, will rely on social support and sale of assets.

The social safety net will eventually get overwhelmed and will be reduced or stopped. The asset market will naturally be oversupplied. By then people will finallly realize their political power is massively diminished.

I dont need to narrate how this will go for all of those living paycheck to paycheck, too old to retrain, no assets to rely on.

The next milestone will be when the purchasing power of the population collapses and businesses start going bankrupt. We might have a UBI discussion then, but unlikely. 

Protests will be illegal, media will be completly captured, moreso than it is now. The oligarch game will change to pacify and disarm. You will not be able to criticize them anymore.

And all of this if we reach ai safety. Aligment means they get to control a super intelligence. If we don’t, we are likely all going to die. 

So strikes are done to prevent governments from giving free reign to AI companies, and to force them to guarantee a redistribution of wealth. They are profiting from the combination of knowledge of humanity.</div>

**What he said:** "The revolution about to be televised. You picked ***the right time but the wrong guy.***"

**What CC typed out:** "The revolution about to be televised. You picked ***the right guy but at the wrong time.***"

WTH is *that* all about?

Too many folks are petrified of hard conversations. You know your friend is unwell so you write em off as flakey and move on with your life. Doesn’t sound like it was much of a relationship worth keeping.

Have the hard conversation folks. Call out crappy friends behaviors, base how you move from the situation after their response.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I just lost a good friend of 7 years bc she was unwilling to bear the discomfort of having this conversation. It hurts a lot, but I’m grateful for the clarity it’s given me. If your friendship can’t survive one difficult conversation especially after 7 years together, then that just means it wasn’t meant to be/has run its course.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think a huge part of it is people are unable/unwilling to see the other side. Everyone takes everything personally and after a while begins to see minor annoying behavior as malicious or 'toxic'. Two friends can end up seeing each other as being flakey/uncaring/toxic because they aren't willing to talk about what is bothering them and they aren't willing to think of themselves as not a victim of the behavior. We are all prone to this sort of thinking and unfortunately social media promotes the hell out of this.

There are endless posts with comments such as "your friend is 15 minutes late to everything and always has an excuse, they don't value you or your time. They are selfish and you have to cut them off" with everyone agreeing, then you'll see another post about the same type of situation from a different preceptive with comments like "your friend is toxic because you have so much on your plate and despite working 2 jobs with kids you still try your best to make it to events to spend time with them but they don't appreciate it and don't value you. They are selfish and you have to cut them off." There's no thought about how both people could be right and wrong or how both people should be more understanding towards the other. 

With friendships you just have to always consider the other side or eventually you will end up seeing everything as toxic and everyone needing to be cut off. (Not to say there aren't legitimate reasons to cut people off because there are of course)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Did this a year ago, friends girlfriend was controlling, so I pointed out to him aside all the shit she's been doing that, frankly, just was insulting to his friends. He noticed a lot of it, some of it he explained there was more going on that we weren't seeing, so of it he wasn't aware of until I said something. All and all, left the conversation feeling good.

Too bad when he talked to her about it, she turned him on us and he cut us all out of his life. Whatever dude, you want to choose a manipulative narcissist over your friends? We tried, you chose, I hope we were wrong, but a group of us all saw the same thing, so I doubt it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Depends on how he defines luxury items.

If he means items that are expensive to create and therefore expensive today, then many of those will get cheaper too.

But I suspect he means something else: He probably means things that have **artificial** scarcity and where they're sold at a price that is a large multiplum of any reasonable production-costs already -- because the scarcity is part of the product, and there's little actual competition for the product since the brand is a huge part of the point.

When a handbag costs $5000, the price is already decoupled from production-costs, so if production-costs fall to half or something, there's no reason that would impact the price of the luxury handbag at all.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That’s interesting because most luxury goods, which have an enormous markup over their original cost, rely on artificial scarcity. If more people could afford them, they would lose their exclusivity and, therefore, their perceived value. The only logical response is to raise the price even further.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There are a lot of luxury items that are intentionally made with older inefficient methods by hand or with old machines. This limits the production output and commands a high price because they are expensive to make and limited. I suspect he's mostly talking about these kinds of things.

Some examples:

* Rolex Watches - They make a certain number of watches per year, parts of the process are done by hand, and they claim they can't really increase production without sacrificing quality. So they just don't increase production.
* Japanese Denim - Lots of Japanese denim is made on old looms imported from the US in the 1950s and carefully maintained. They are much less efficient than modern looms, but give unique properties to the denim. That's why you're looking at $300-400 USD for these jeans.
* Fountain Pens - Many are hand assembled and hand tuned, and at the high end there is hand done art work. They may apply urushi lacquer that has to be applied in multiple coats by hand. (there is also lots of artificial scarcity created in the fountain pen world, but I'm talking about the upper end)

  
I wouldn't say the scarcity is artificial in any of the above examples, assuming Rolex is telling the truth that they don't believe they can scale up production and maintain quality. There are just a limited number of people who know how or are willing to do the work. Or you have old machines that are hard to replicate.

These things do have a higher perceived value because some human had to be skilled at a craft to create them, and that limits the output.

  
But yes, you are right there are lots of big luxury brands that totally create artificial scarcity and it could probably be scaled up a lot more if they wanted to.</div>

&gt;something for which it’s hard not to say “this time it’s different”

&gt;we can now imagine a world where we cure all diseases, have much more time to enjoy with our families, and can fully realize our creative potential

&gt;**In a decade**, perhaps everyone on earth will be capable of accomplishing more than the most impactful person can today

By decade, he means not AGI but it's final outcome.

&gt;AI may turn out to be like the transistor economically—a big scientific discovery that scales well and that seeps into almost every corner of the economy

&gt;computers, TVs, cars, toys, and more \[...\] perform miracles

&gt;The world will not change all at once \[...\] people in 2025 will mostly spend their time in the same way they did in 2024

Though the **most important thing**:

&gt;scientific progress will likely be much faster than it is today

That's where the money's at, that's the game changer

&gt;The price of many goods will eventually fall dramatically \[...\] the price of \[...\] land may rise even more dramatically

Landlord buttfucking the people electric bogaloo 742.0

&gt;including open-sourcing more

*on which he never develops...*

&gt;increasing **equality** does not seem technologically determined and getting this right may **require new ideas**

Socialism. That's the word you're looking for.

But that man cannot for the life of he get out of his tiny world of rich entrepreneur and views any prosperous human being as such:

&gt;giving some “**compute budget**” to enable everyone on Earth to use a lot of AI \[...\] to **direct** however they can imagine

So long for UBI, i suppose.

&gt;Thanks especially to **Josh Achiam, Boaz Barak and Aleksander Madry** for reviewing drafts of this

Then it hit me: AI is trained on massive datasets, and the vast majority of images online depict **right-handed people**. Since left-handed people make up only **10% of the population**, the AI is way more likely to assume **everyone is right-handed by default**.

                <div class="post-content">I just joined a new company where at the end of Q4, each person on our team received $1000 to purchase whatever we wanted. Some girls bought boots, others bought coats, but I’m looking for something that I can use in my everyday life and is a good return of my investment. I’ve been researching E ink notebooks, different stocks, investment pieces of jewelry, a new backpack or something that would benefit my daily life in one way or another.

Instead you get those AFD f@cks thinking that it is the German boarders they have to worry about, small minded unambitious people. France doing their own thing in technology and the rest do their own thing in the military department...

EU wants to mimic the success of the United States and it ends up resembling the Holy Roman Empire more and more. A loose co-federation that everyone does their own thing and everyone else can make fools out of them... brilliant.</div>

Yeah I'm shocked how few people know him. I genuinely have so much respect for the guy. Even besides his achievements he is one of the most grounded and level-headed AI spokesmen right now.

But ironically, the biggest boost to my productivity came when I started doing less… or rather, being more intentional with my mindset.

I tried doing it first thing in the morning to get off to a good start to my day but then found it harder to focus when I was still groggy. Then when I tried pushing it to later in the morning life just took over and I couldn’t make time for it and again the focus was tough.

I lost the right to choose in half the country - but did spending years preparing for that and seeing the writing on the wall actually change anything for the better? if my taxes are going to go up or I’m going to pay more due to historic inflation or tariffs, is there any actual benefit to knowing in advance if I’m already doing what I can to financially prepare myself for emergencies as best as I can? these are honest questions.</div>

SoCal = Southern California for the non Americans here.

Here's the full leaked video he's referring to where you can hear the Navy personnel yell "Splash!" as soon as the UFO/USO goes underwater.

Ridicule of looking crazy, because you saw something moving in a weird manner in the sky or other domain you can't attribute a plausible explanation to. On top of that, maybe there might not have been a proper reporting mechanism in place for people to go to. Maybe even if it did get reported, the report probably didn't get followed up, or simply gets classified. Maybe all of the above or a combination of numerous said factors.

When in the meantime he's Crossing his heart and and hopes to die and you can stick a needle in his eye if he is lying. He's got to wait and you can trust him.  

See you are stationed in San Diego and he was in SoCal. There's a difference apparently. I mean come on, it's not like you know anybody that's stationed in SoCal that would have maybe even just told you verbally. I mean it's so common they don't even feel the need to bring it up. I mean you know guys in the Navy. It's not like they talk about mundane stuff because it's so mundane. How many times have you had fellow soldiers talk about Chow or any of their duties that they do that are mundane? I've never heard of soldiers  talking or complaining about anything that's mundane. Have you ever heard a soldier talk about how food is the same everyday or how a watch Duty sucks? 9 sorry I don't know the terms)Or how whatever repetitive tasks they have to do all the time feels unnecessary? No, of course not. Because it's so mundane they just assume everybody knows about it and they don't feel the need to complain or share their experience or even mention it to another soul on any other ship or any other Duty. They just know that everyone feels the same way they do so there's no need to express it to anyone. So if it's normal to see UAP flying in and out of the water all the time of course they're just going to assume everybody knows about it and there's no need to share those stories with anybody on their ship or anybody they knows it's in the same branch of military with them because they assume they see the same shit.

That's how the military Works isn't it?

                                <div class="reply-body">There's no way Trump isn't on the list. He was openly joking about how Epstein had similar taste in women to him years before Epstein was caught, joking about Epstein liking them young too. 

Add that to the other allegations against him- Plus his ownership of Miss Teen USA- Plus his friendship with Maxwell... Its pretty clear he's one of the more frequent customers. 

It makes a lot of sense when you ask the question "Why has Trump, who goes after everyone for even the most petty thing never gone after the Clintons about Epstein?" and the answer is it's not something he wants looked at.</div>
