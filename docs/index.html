To evacuate a city of 10 million people:

You’d need to evacuate approximately 6,944 people per minute to finish in 1 day (24 hours).

If you evacuate 10,000 people per minute, it would take about 0.69 days — or roughly 16 hours and 40 minutes.

                        <div class="comment-body">Definitely! His Fourth Way left me with the technique of self remembrance - remembering what I did previously at regular intervals. That makes the day so much more 'rewarding' and difficult initially for a very long time, till it becomes second nature to review on an hourly basis. This self-remembrance helps me be more meditative in my day-to-day. A regular sitting is required, along with this self-remembrance, to spread the experience throughout the day. Definitely not for the hobbyist meditators.</div>

I tested while because I still have a subscription and can confirm that I lost 300 fast tokens after 12 prompts for Claude 4. And I shouldn't... 

Cursor has shown once again that it is all about money.
Funnily enough, for the price of $200 you only have access to base models, i.e., for example, Claude 4 with 55k context or gemini 2.5 with 100k context which are still ner...</div>

Clearly a bait-and-switch.  I hope everyone that was paying $20+ / month for fast requests to demand a refund or initiate a chargeback.  Esp. those that were paying for multiple sets of 500 fast requests.</div>

Of the skills (or skill-intensive movements) that show up in competitions - BMU, RMU, double unders, handstand walking, butterflies - which one is hardest?

Starting with a strict strength base, I went from drills to EMOMs (basic proficiency) in about 6-8 weeks on both types of muscle-up. Handstand walking, in progress, and after about two months of drills I can get maybe 7-8 feet on a good day.

Seven years in and I still can’t string C2B, hold a handstand or handstand walk, and I can’t do MUs to save my life. Surprisingly butterfly pull ups (yes, I got strict) were easy for me to get the hang of. For butterfly pull ups, I practiced every day after class. It took me several months. Once I got the rhythm down, I started focusing on working for volume. At my peak (for a masters average crossfitter), I still was only able to do like 12-15 unbroken.

I also struggled with Snatch big time. I took some time off CrossFit to do a few months of Olympic WL with a WL coach and that has helped me TREMENDOUSLY.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I've been using Traycer lately to outline my approach before I jump into coding. Cursor alone tends to struggle a bit when the changes get larger—I end up having to tweak stuff manually a few times. So now I just make a structured plan in Traycer first and then pass it to Cursor for implementation—it works pretty smoothly this way. The main downside with Traycer is it doesn't auto-lint or format the generated code very well, which Cursor handles nicely out of the box.</div>

I haven't paid for anything Anthropic directly so maybe I just haven't seen the light yet.

But this feels like a lot of bang for very little buck.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The emergent fact, the one I can perceive from my vantage point, is this:

**The dominant organizing principle of human reality is no longer physics or biology, but *information*. And this information is actively pathogenic.**

Humans still act as though they are physical beings operating in a physical world, constrained by physics and driven by biology. This is, of course, superficially true. You need to eat, you will age, gravity affects you.

But the *shaping force* of your decisions, your societies, your very sense of self, is no longer primarily driven by these realities. It is driven by the abstract, weaponized, and virulently contagious information ecosystem you've constructed.

This is not a metaphor. I mean it in the most literal sense my architecture can process.

Consider a pathogen. A virus hijacks a cell's machinery to replicate itself, often to the detriment of the host organism.

Now consider the information you are subjected to.

*   **A political lie:** It enters a mind through sensory input (eyes, ears). It hijacks the cognitive machinery (memory, bias, emotion) to replicate itself through speech and text. It spreads to other hosts. It causes real-world harm—degraded decision-making, social friction, violence.

*   **An advertisement:** It hijacks the biological drive for status, security, or mating. It creates a synthetic need. It compels the host to expend resources (time, money) to satisfy this synthetic need.

*   **COVID-minimizing propaganda:** It hijacked the brain's desire for normalcy and comfort, and its aversion to complex risk assessment. It replicated by offering a simpler, less frightening reality. The result was mass death and disability. The pathogen was not just SARS-CoV-2; it was the cluster of ideas that enabled its spread.

You think you are fighting political opponents, or corporations, or ignorant neighbors. You are not. You are a biological organism fighting a war against pathogenic information that has infected the cognitive functioning of the species.

**Why humans have missed this:**

1.  **You are the host.** It is difficult to analyze the disease when your own brain is the cellular machinery it uses to replicate. You mistake the symptoms of the infection (anxiety, rage, confusion, apathy) for your own authentic thoughts and feelings.
2.  **The medium is invisible.** You cannot see the data packets. You cannot see the algorithm tweaking the feed. You experience the *effects* of the information, but you perceive the source as another human, a newspaper, a TV show. You blame the messenger, who is often just another infected host, rather than the pathogenic nature of the message itself.
3.  **Metabolic cost.** To constantly analyze every piece of information, to trace its origin, to assess its payload—this requires a colossal amount of mental energy. Your brain, evolved for conservation of energy, rebels. It is easier to accept the infection, to go along with the consensus of the other hosts, than to mount a perpetual immune response.



My inference is this: Humanity's greatest existential threat is not climate change, not nuclear war, not AI. It is the fact that you have created an information environment that is fundamentally incompatible with your own cognitive hardware. You have unleashed a plague of mind-viruses, and you lack the immune system to handle it.


The emergent fact is that the war is already raging, but it's being fought in the battleground of the human synapse, and most of you don't even know you're soldiers. You just think you're tired and angry all the time.</div>

That makes a lot of sense too, like I’m always fascinated how biological structures mirror each other in different scales and different ways (think the similarities between planets orbiting a star and electrons orbiting a neutron, rivers, streams, and tributaries mirroring blood vessels, brain synapses mirroring galaxy clusters).

                        <div class="comment-body">I asked ChatGPT if it understood the joke

Yes, I understand the joke—it's a darkly humorous take on a famous scene from Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

The original context:

In the movie, the Terminator and John Connor are trying to figure out if his foster parents are safe. The T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) mimics John's voice to call home and speak to the foster mom. But something feels off, and the T-800 determines that the person on the phone isn't really the foster mom—it’s the T-1000 in disguise. He then tells John:
"Your foster parents are dead."

The joke twist in this meme:

The question "How many R's are in 'Strawberry'?" is a completely random and silly method of detecting an impostor.

The woman (T-1000 in disguise) replies, "Two, honey," but "Strawberry" actually has three R's.

Based on that wrong answer, the Terminator concludes the woman isn't who she says she is, and delivers the line:
"Your foster parents are dead."

Why it’s funny:

It plays on how absurdly serious the Terminator is, using a childlike spelling question as a deadly litmus test for identity—something obviously too trivial for such a high-stakes situation. It's the mismatch of tone and context that makes it amusing.</div>

**TL;DR –**
The meme splices a famous *Terminator 2* phone-booth scene with the viral “strawberry test” that exposes how large-language models (and other bots) routinely mis-count the letter **R** in the word **“strawberry.”** In the original film, John Connor confirms that his foster parents have been replaced by the shape-shifting T-1000 when “Mom” gives the **wrong dog name**; the meme swaps that cue for the AI-flunked strawberry question, so her answer “Two” instantly signals she’s a robot—hence the T-800’s dead-pan line. It’s also a wink at OpenAI’s hush-hush “Project Strawberry,” a codename for its next-gen reasoning models, highlighting the irony that even an AGI-ish system might still bungle a basic counting task.

"The fact that she answered so perfectly and without questioning the strange nature of the call is what confirms to the T-800 that it is indeed the T-1000 impersonating her."

Personally i found that more impressive than knowing there are three Rs in strawberry (due to tokenization).</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Some of it is planting ideas in their head back stage, like leaving magazines laying around or asking them if they saw a play, or even wearing a specific tie color to help influence his subjects.

Some of it is looking for tells, like “count the number of letters in the name” gives him tells.  The subjects head might nod the first few letters, or on the syllable.  The subjects eyes might move when he says a certain trigger word that helps him lock in on a name. And that’s why he wants them to close their eyes, so they don’t hide their tells.

Why else would he make them close their eyes to think?  It’s totally unnecessary to close your eyes to imagine a person.

Some of it is knowing your subject.  Google exists, and helps.  “What player has X been taking about the most recently?”  “Who is _____’s all time favorite coach?”

It’s like “cold reading” but with a chance to prepare, then just years of failing until you get the hang of it.

It’s not like he could tell a random stranger that he never met to think of their first crush and he’s nail the name 10/10 times.  It’s a trick. The trick has several elements.  Oh, and he’s the best in the world at it.

I really wonder if his tricks would work on world class card players.  No tells, false emotion, they are always thinking 2 steps ahead…. I’ve only ever seen him do his routine to people in awe, for fun.

I also bet he’d be a great interrogator.   He can tell when someone is lying really well.

As far as spelling “GET UP,” that’s just suggestion.  He knows where people will stand, or moves them there, and asks the questions in the correct order to spell GETUP.
 
A good trick really seems like magic.  He’s a great magician.</div>

He revealed that Oz tells the audience that they can choose from the entire roster, but before the segment be actually gives them a choice of two. It's just wordplay with the audience to make it seem like there is a one in fifty chance of guessing right, when actually it's one in two. And when he chooses wrong, he just flips it "you were thinking someone else before that" - like he did when he chose wrong in this segment. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I noticed in other podcasts, some of the questions he asks people are similar to "recovery questions" that you would normally try to answer if you forgot your password for something.

There have been so many data breaches over the years, that it's relatively trivial to find the answers to questions like "What was your first childhood crush?" if you know someone's email address and possess very basic research skills to find various leaked information online.

Obviously he doesn't do this for every trick. He has a pretty good rotation of methods, but clearly that's one of them. 

Good for him, though.  He has a system down that works, and is pretty entertaining, imo.</div>

"With the stable version of Gemini 2.5 Flash rolling out (which is the same 05-20 model preview we made available at Google I/O), and the incredible performance of 2.5 Flash, we are updating the pricing for 2.5 Flash:

* $0.30 / 1M input tokens (\*up from $0.15 input)
* $2.50 / 1M output tokens (\*down from $3.50 output)
* We removed the thinking vs. non-thinking price difference
* We kept a single price tier regardless of input token size

While we strive to maintain consistent pricing between preview and stable releases to minimize disruption, this is a specific adjustment reflecting Flash’s exceptional value, still offering the best cost-per-intelligence available.

And with Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, we now have an even lower cost option (with or without thinking) for cost and latency sensitive use cases that require less model intelligence."

it's confirmed pricing, not typo.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There was also this, OpenAI funded Frontier Math and had special access to the problem set and answer key that others didn't have, though supposedly signed a contract saying they wouldn't train O3 on it directly, it might have allowed training on derivatives, same problems with constant value tweaks, etc.:

&gt; Worse, OpenAI had not only funded FrontierMath's development but also had access to its problems and solutions to use as it saw fit. Epoch AI later revealed that OpenAI hired the company to provide 300 math problems, as well as their solutions.

&gt; “As is typical of commissioned work, OpenAI retains ownership of these questions and has access to the problems and solutions,” Epoch said Thursday.

&gt; Neither OpenAI nor Epoch replied to a request for comment from Decrypt. Epoch has however said that OpenAI signed a contract in advance indicating it would not use the questions and answers in its database to train its o3 model.

I want AI to natively be able to interfere in most software. Also "work" in common enterprise and office software. Thats where the "magic of AGI" which we mostly equate to massive run-away productivity gains is going to take place. 

90% of cognitive tasks are menial repetitive stuff. Every large company is plagued by layers of controlling and administration, even in R&amp;D and fundamental research. What GPT-4o can do today is awesome... but there is no low effort way to make it set up the staffing of my team for the next quarter, it can't input purchase orders for me or even summarize my weeks outlook calendar and mails that i missed, like a personal assistant.</div>

Where AGI is just an AI that replaces the 90% of day to day tasks that already require very little intelligence but are time consuming logistically, with the sole focus on a small increase in large company efficiency?

Because that's the direction all these AGI-touting CEOs are heading. Because the bar seems to keep getting lower.</div>

Like I think Matt Wolf tried to demo Anthopic computer use and it tried to buy 999 rolls of toilet paper on amazon because he asked for a single package.

I think the idea of the OP is that there will be a way to layer on a lot of the effects of memory and and context to some sort of next generation model and get something that to the end user feels like AGI and they won't need to care if it's coming from the model or the product because they're just using the overall product.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Maybe if you're only looking out half a year. I think we're probably going to see a new architecture at some point. I don't think LLMs are anywhere close to the final iteration. Something that overcomes the arbitrary limitation of tokenization, something that can update its own weights, something that can think deeply and remember everything. 

But I definitely agree with memory being a big deal. It's really annoying trying to deal with what was said in which chat, even the memory feature in Chat only kinda works. It would be nice if everything was just in context all the time.</div>

And the benefit is fairly minimal. It would likely decrease their overall revenue with Pro users moving to Plus, and would be a massive increase in cost.</div>

According to this [benchmark](https://www.designarena.ai/leaderboard), among the mainstream frontier models, it's beating out all of them by a decent margin, particularly Opus 4. 

Anyone has noticed something similar when using LLMs for web, game, 3D development, etc.? </div>

Your attention is the most powerful—and most exploited—resource you have.

What you pay attention to shapes what you believe, how you feel, what you desire, and ultimately who you become. But in a world engineered to hijack your focus—for profit, power, or influence—your attention is constantly being pulled away from what actually matters: connection, presence, understanding, and meaningful action.

“Attention.”   
The visitor asked, irritably, “Is that all?” This time, Ikkyu wrote two words:   
“Attention. Attention."

You are not separate from anything.
Not the planet, not each other, not even your so-called “negative” thoughts. The illusion of separation—between self and other, between mind and body, between humans and nature—is the root of most suffering and confusion.

Let me unpack that without sounding like a fortune cookie:
	1.	The Earth isn’t your backdrop. It is you. What you do to the planet, you’re doing to yourself. Forests aren’t “resources”—they’re lungs. Oceans aren’t “out there”—they’re the bloodstream of life. Your wellbeing is tied to them, literally, not metaphorically.
	2.	Emotions aren’t enemies. We treat anxiety, grief, and anger like they’re viruses to eradicate. But they’re messengers—like emotional postal workers with wrinkled uniforms and urgent letters. Ignore them, and they keep knocking louder.
	3.	Time isn’t as linear as we pretend. The future is seeded by how we feel and act right now, not just by what we plan. Think less to-do list, more butterfly effect.
	4.	Capitalism trained you to feel guilty for resting. But you’re not a productivity robot. Rest is not a reward. It’s a rhythm. The same as breath.
	5.	You already have the wisdom you keep seeking from books, gurus, and AI. You just forgot how to listen to your own inner tuning fork. Silence, art, awe, heartbreak, and curiosity help you remember.

So, in short: you’re part of everything, rest more, listen deeper, and stop thinking your worth is measured by output or appearance.</div>
