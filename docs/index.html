then i decided to break one apart line by line actually run each piece through chatgpt and cosine CLI to see what failed.

somewhere in the middle of fixing syntax errors and printing random stuff, it clicked. i wasn’t just “following code” anymore i was reading it. it made sense. i could see how one function triggered another.

Keep it up!</div>

Does this give Tesla any hidden advantage once they get it working? Not to mention the US has so much more compute our AI will probably be better to control the robots, but China is probably better at mass manufacturing / scaling manufacturing from what little I know? Then again if robots start building factories, eventually whoever has the AI to do that first probably pulls ahead.</div>

Also this is probably the first time I’ve heard an OAI researcher publicly say they think updating model weights is in the cards for the future, which I think is significant.

Edit: this quote from the second screenshot is highly interesting too I thought:

&gt;I don't think there is any winter in this sense coming; if anything, it may actually have a very sharp improvement in the next year or two... which is something to almost be a little scared of."</div>

I can’t wait to see what kinds of coding projects these systems will be capable of in 1-2 years, if they can be fine-tuned on anyone’s code base and remember all the important details directly within their neural net.</div>

It feels more like and advisor and expert. 

I build with Claude Code, which does. 7/10 job debugging and 9/10 refactoring. 

When it can’t solve my issue I use Grok which tends to do a 9/10 job on most issues. Has a bigger context window, ingests dev documentation from sites better and does a good job not losing context if I have to hit it a few times. 

The only issue is actually that the context window is a bit too sticky. If I come back to that same instance with a new problem it often will try to continue to solve the previous problem.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">sounds like you found a solid workflow balancing the strengths of each model. One thought: for the sticky context issue, I usually start a fresh instance or reset the conversation when switching problems. That keeps the focus clean and prevents the model from carrying over previous context that might confuse thin....</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's not good, it mixes up things and it takes much longer time. I don’t really use ChatGPT for debugging anymore. I switched to Kilo Code in VS Code, it fits my workflow better. It has modes for each step: Architect to plan, Orchestrator to split tasks, and Code and Debug for small, reviewable diffs with checkpoints. The Debug mode actually walks through the issue instead of guessing, so fixes make more sense and stay clean. I bring my own API keys (true pay-per-use), so I can mix models per mode without worrying about cost (this is the part i am still testing, for best results and costs) Been a solid setup for our agency... happy to keep spreading the word and help the team grow. :) Give it a try. The extension is free.</div>

Amazon is trying to replace all their warehouse workers and drivers and white collar workers even with AI/robotics. And they aggressively are trying not to pay any taxes at all. They just want to operate with 0 expenses, 0 salaries, 0 taxes. It's obscene corporate greed that AI partly enables.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The logistics automation wave is real, but it's worth noting that deploying AI systems at scale—especially in robotic applications—requires massive computational infrastructure. Amazon's advantage isn't just in their models, it's in their proprietary cloud infrastructure that lets them iterate and deploy at speed.

This creates a cascading effect: companies need better access to powerful, specialized compute to compete. Which is driving the entire NeoCloud and specialized GPU infrastructure market. The race to automate logistics becomes, in many ways, a race for computing infrastructure.

If you're tracking how infrastructure availability is shaping which companies can actually execute AI projects at scale, [https://neoclouddaily.replit.app/](https://neoclouddaily.replit.app/) follows these developments as compute providers compete to enable the next generation of AI applications.</div>

Lately I’ve started to see it differently. The point isn’t to stop thinking, it’s to notice that I’m thinking and not get dragged away every time. That tiny pause between “oh I’m lost in thought again” and “back to breathing” that’s the practice.

It was addressed in a David Nichtern interview on the Duncan Trussel podcast. My sessions fluctuate wildly depending on how much stress I have in my life. But I try to sit daily even when it is only 5 minutes, and feel that it is a routine now that improves my resilience to the difficulties of life. Allowing yourself to just experience life is one of the most difficult things that meditation has taught me.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You just discovered the actual secret that most meditation teachers dance around for months before telling people: the practice isn't about achieving some perfect quiet mind. 

It's about building tolerance for your own internal chaos without needing to fix it or run from it.

The reason you feel calmer when you stop fighting is that the fighting itself was creating most of the suffering, not the thoughts. ú

Congrats, you just graduated from "trying to meditate correctly" to "actually meditating."</div>

A new “Markovian Thinking” approach helps AI models handle much longer reasoning by breaking their thinking into small, linked steps.

                                <div class="reply-body">As counterintuitive as this sounds, I think a lot of transformer specific concepts and ideas are a lot more intuitive (at least to me) than early 20th century physics and beyond. I tried for a physics minor, couldn’t cut it at junior level phys courses, so I “downgraded” to computational physics (basically numerical analysis).

But a lot of the modern LLM stuff is just built off of pure engineering and intuition driven abstractions. If you’re serious about understanding the field and have a reasonable background in compsci and some numerical analysis or linear algebra, it probably takes about less than a week to be comfortable reading SoTA papers and get comfortable with mapping out the field. The actual “core” of the transformer is really small and easy to internalize. The specializations these days tend to lean towards either engineering/incremental optimizations or theoretical ideas. Both are fairly accessible to new comers. My favorite anecdote here is that the (still) SoTA method for training-free context extension was first discovered by “random redditors” on this very sub before being rediscovered and formalized and published later by Meta and then Eleuther.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, the naming here is kinda misleading. Looks like  you’re coming from a traditional Markov chain or HMM background, so I get you.

They’re not saying reasoning itself is Markovian - they’re forcing a Markov-like structure onto how the model handles long reasoning chains.

From what I’ve read, they basically chop the whole reasoning process into chunks, and each chunk only gets to look at the one right before it - not the full chain. So they’re kinda faking a Markov property. It sounds like using a first-order Markov assumption in NLP - we know it’s not fully true, but it’s often good enough when the trade-off saves tons of compute.

So, they’re betting that most reasoning steps only need a short-term summary, not the entire conversation history.

P.S I’m wondering if it will tank reasoning quality the same way deepseek did. We will see</div>

In comparison they say NVIDIA shipped about double that number of server GPUs in 2024 with the total of 3.8-4 million units.

When you consider between how many different large and small customers the Nvidia's number is split Google seems to be increasing compute way faster than anyone else.</div>

He explained that in-site LNG turbines are by far the fastest way to get to power. They build the gas turbines to power the data centers while they wait for grid power. Once they’re connected to the grid, gas turbines are used for backup power. He also showed a data center they built powered by solar. The data center is like 5% of the total area while solar and batteries are about 90% of the area. Meanwhile it’s basically the opposite for on site power from gas turbines.</div>
