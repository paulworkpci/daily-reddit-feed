Like we gave a no bid contract to Halliburton to rebuild Iraq after we destroyed it. Why can’t we just give them a no bid contract to rebuild Detroit, same fuckers make the same money but at least the US citizens who are paying for it get something out of it. And in the process maybe we don’t gotta destroy Iraq, I’m sure they would be down for that too.</div>

That money is spent on ammo, weapons, armor and vehicles here in the US and then we send the things we make to the country. It’s $50 Billion dollars a year being pumped into the American economy. I’d love to see what happens if we quit spending it. Look what happened when Trump quit spending a fraction of that. I don’t think people understand the role government spending plays in our economy and workforce.

[Here’s a list of the things we sent](https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-political-military-affairs/releases/2025/01/u-s-security-cooperation-with-ukraine/), all of which were manufactured in the US by American workers.</div>

“ Designing robust reward structures that do not inadvertently incentivize unwanted behavior is remarkably hard, and it isn’t a problem limited to human institutions; it’s also one of the core challenges in developing capable, aligned AI systems”

“
It’s common for frontier reasoning models to very clearly state their intent within their chain-of-thought. For example, they are often so forthright about their plan to subvert a task they think “Let’s hack”.
We can monitor their thinking with another LLM and effectively flag misbehavior.
Their natural monitorability is very fragile. If strong supervision is directly applied to the chain-of-thought, models can learn to hide their intent while continuing to misbehave.”</div>

More tokens really just gives the model more time to hone its' intuition toward the answer.

These are logical issues with no robust solutions. 

If you want very advanced models to do what you want them to do we need to slow the fuck down, get a lot more people in mechanistic interpretability and not build anything more advanced till we have 100% understanding and control over current models.</div>

My productivity goes up, like no more brain fog, in the morning its just overwhelming to do anything, I can't focus on anything, but at night I can put my mind to anything and complete it.

My reaction time improves, I can talk and think faster, in the morning I can't make a 'tch tch tch' sound very fast but I can do it at night.

                        <div class="comment-body">I love how the leading figures in this field often have very open-doors when it comes to the potential experience of these systems. It shows how much we still don't know. And I think it's good to acknowledge that. While on the other hand, you get redditors claiming left and right, that they somehow cracked the mystery and these things are just data and it is impossible for them to be intelligent or reason about something.

How can we really be sure that we aren't also effectively piles of mathematical computations performed by neurons on a set of inputs to produce a set of outputs? If we cannot identify the physical processes that lead to experience in ourselves, we can't identify it in anything.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’m really appreciating the rich conversation here, thank you.

It seems like there are two main perspectives emerging:

	1.	Skeptical View: Consciousness in machines is either unprovable or extremely unlikely, making concerns about machine suffering not worth serious consideration.

	2.	Precautionary View: While we don’t fully understand consciousness, it’s possible that machines could one day develop some form of subjective experience, and with that, the capacity to suffer. Even though it may be very unlikely, the potential consequences could be enormous, so it is worth remaining mindful of the possibility.

Is there anything I’m missing or misrepresenting from either side?

My thoughts:

Consciousness is whack, complex, mysterious.  We don’t really get it.  AI will probably help us better understand it.  We kinda smart, but not that smart.  Maybe AI can haz subjective experience, maybe not.  

Let’s be open to that possibility as we design an intelligence that far surpasses our own (along with being mindful of the alignment problem and a range of other potential challenges).

Also: Opinion - it would be far wiser to develop this technology carefully over a longer time horizon, with far more consideration (although it’s a treat to personally experience it being developed so quickly).

We have no idea what will happen when we hit ASI, we don’t have the brain compute to know.  

Make fancy car fast, worst case scenario: it kills a dozen people.  

Make ASI fast, worst case scenario: billions die.

Maybe more consideration okay, even if likelihoods are low.</div>

John Pelletier worked for Metro for more than two decades and is now the chief of the Maui Police Department in Hawaii.

Pelletier is one of several defendants named in the lawsuit filed last Friday in California. The Maui mayor has called on the police chief to be put on leave and, as of Tuesday, he has not stepped down.

Interestingly the model's architecture is very different from Llama, Gemma and PaliGemma's.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">For benchmarks on Chat LMSYS, Gemma 3 (27B) is comparable to OpenAI's o1 performance and is above Claude 3.7 Sonnet and DeepSeek-V3.

"In this section, we report the performance of Gemma 3 IT 27B model on LMSys Chatbot Arena in blind side-by-side evaluations by human raters against other state-of-the-art models. We report Elo scores in Table 5. Gemma 3 27B IT is among the top 10 best models, with a score comparable to o1-preview. It is above other non-thinking open models, such as DeepSeek-V3, LLaMA 3 405B, and Qwen2.5-70B, which are much larger models. Finally, the Elo of Gemma 3 is significantly higher than Gemma 2, at 1220. Note that Elo scores do not take into account visual abilities, which none of the aforementioned open IT models have."

P.S. If you want to run Gemma 3 on your favorite inference engine, we uploaded GGUF, 4-bit etc versions to Hugging Face: [Unsloth Gemma 3 Collection ](https://huggingface.co/collections/unsloth/gemma-3-67d12b7e8816ec6efa7e4e5b)</div>

I, for one, will be tuning in to this report w/ 60 Minutes on Sunday. As you may know, alongside with investigations w/ Enigma as well as many other groups scratching their heads - we see no slowing down of reports from citizens GLOBALLY of these drones flying silently over residential neighborhoods as well as sensitive military installations. This must be addressed officially, and so far here in 2025 we've had no clarity offered by the administration or the FAA regarding these drones. You better believe this is a subject worth following. Something hasn't been sitting right with this one. What do you think is happening?

                                <div class="reply-body">I have worked in the commercial drone industry.  Every drone needs a remote ID that directly reports to the FAA what the drone is, the manufacturer and what it is capable of doing, height, speed and who it belongs to.  You can't fly over large cities like for instance, Denver, without permission (there are specific places where you train with drones and its not over large urban centers..think small airports, military places, RC flying grounds) and if it was a mistake, it wouldn't be happening night after night for months now.  I've been watching them over Denver and Boulder and beyond, every single night for 3 months now.   They've flown directly over me a half dozen times and Ive counted upwards of 50.  Some are stationary.  Most often they are silent.  Sometimes they sounds like a small cessna.  Sometimes it holds a bright white light flying over residential.  Sometimes lights blink-red, white, green.  Sometimes they leave off a spray that doesn't break up like vapor. Sometimes there's a bright white stationary light they seem to gravitate toward, typically in the western sky.  For the first time last night, I saw two flying together, not fixed wing, bright red lights.  I would say the ones that aren't fixed wing are quads, but they're not.  Odd.  Just to be clear, I'm well aware of what an airplane looks like and that DIA is due East.  These are not planes.  Not at all.  I have my theories.  I have seen other things in the sky that defy all reason but since I don't know, I remain an observer.</div>

This all started in the UK, which wasn't really reported on and was pretty much forgotten about once the NJ sightings started.  Then the US elections happened - the administration changed, and this was all but forgotten about amid the rest of the chaos. 

Then we get this lame statement from the dolt press secretary saying these were all simply approved FAA drones with a dumb look on her face.  Really?  No one in the military, FBI, local PDs, etc. seemed to have been told  this, and airports were being shut down... but this was the answer?</div>

This AI shits only getting better

And we need people to be afraid of misusing it

It’s the same shit as Labeling ADs as ADs

Teacher: "your paper has tested positive for AI."

Student: "here's one copy of my 150 hours of video recording, 4750 different saves of my documents, a banker's box of xeroxed citations, and proof of interaction with you-personally over earlier drafts.

Teacher: "hey hey I'm not going to read your *EvIdEnCe*, the machine went beep and that's that."

Student: "note how I said ***one*** copy - the other copies are for my lawyer and your license, if all peaceful means are exhausted."

Teacher: "beeeeeeep... tell me more about the peaceful means."

100 teachers with day jobs will fold before 20000 students with their lives ahead of them *already invested in the school in the form of tuition* will fold ***(or high school students whose home situation does an instant 180 turn if high school suddenly labels them a schoolcriminal.)*** People with student loans will breathe fire and their sheer numbers will steamroll the opposition. Educators will be told *"don't worry we got your back"* from bureaucrats (been both for a bit) and then *when this turns out to be a lie* the teachers on the front line will lose their passion for fighting this war. **Short version: teachers, lose passion.** (Note regarding ratio: numbers exclude the lower ranking ones and so will any hypothetical battle - if a student worker fights they're probably fighting on the student side. Adjuncts aren't troops they owe no fighting loyalty.)

Expecting teachers to fight a war is a classic example of giving a job to somebody who already has a job - this war will be given up and not by the endless legions of students who replenish their numbers constantly.</div>

When you try to be consistent with anything, you will run into dilemmas:

* You stayed late at work today, and now you have no me-time. Do you stay up late to make up for it, or get ready for bed even though it feels unfair?

# [WITHOUT PAYWALL](https://archive.ph/OD9DM)

This article covers a lot of ground. No debunkers in sight, just real journalism. It's wild that mainstream publications are now talking about potential clean energy breakthroughs in connection to UFOs:

&gt;***The scientists among the film’s experts say that there could be a real humanitarian benefit to opening up this information. The combustion-free energy used to power UAPs — they’ve been reported to move at supersonic speeds with no signs of emissions or propulsion mechanisms — could be the biggest breakthrough in clean energy since nuclear power and eliminate the need for fossil fuels.***

And by the time they realize it was basically just a Used Car Salesman tactic and they want to vote him out? Too late; he's already defied the courts and suspended elections. And when they take to the streets? He has control of the Military and National Guard.

They voted the fox right into the hen house. He's not ever going to leave and he's doing to do whatever the fuck he wants from this point on, until he either decides to retire and appoint an heir, or dies.

We had our chance to avoid this, but a slightly larger margin of my fellow Americans are the dumbest fucking creatures to ever walk the planet earth.</div>
