When I was at the cash registry I paid in cash and the cashier gave me some coins as return. It was a couple of pennies and a euro. Since I didn't want the pennies I just left them on the desk and took the euro only. As I was going back home I realized my keys weren't in my pocket. I quickly got into a small panic mode and searched both my pockets twice and they weren't there.

                        <div class="comment-body">We strongly avoid seeing our own misperceptions. Because once you see it, as you've clearly shown, you can't unsee it. And the last thing your mind needs, is distrust in its ways of thinking.

If we're similar, this will lead down a lovely and shocking road of changing how you see reality all together. 

If you ever get disoriented and confused as this unfolds, it can help to remember that your mind's main goal is the survival of your body. It will automatically view things, true or not, in a way that it thinks serves your survival. No problem in leaning into that if you need to, by keeping your health, finances, and relationships on track.

LMK if you need any useful practices!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">New research suggests that making things up is what the brain is best at. At every instant, it’s trying to predict what the next instant will look like - and our conscious experience is a just mashup of the brain’s expectation, combined with what really happens. This is why optical illusions work.

AGI is going to change the value of money when it's deployed and these are senior researchers so they understand the implications of AGI.

The only explanation is that they DONT see a clear path to AGI and Sam was being a hypeman as usual.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">OpenAI offers PPUs (profit participation units). Due to their weird structure (franken-hybrid of non-profit/public-benefit/corporation) they don't grant RSUs or ISOs.

So you have a base salary of $300k and then the equity side which is a few million worth of PPUs.

But what is the future potential of PPUs?

Can you sell them in tender offers? If OpenAI is able to convert properly to a corporation, do they convert to RSUs? If they go public do they convert to stock?

I wonder if it's just better to go to literally any other company that has equity that's more of a guarantee, whether it's equity that's already liquid with Meta or another public company, or with a start-up offering ISO/RSUs.</div>

But the simple answer is probably that 10 years ago, AI was just sorting algorithms and maybe some image recognition. It wasn’t coming after anyone’s job. People don’t like threats to their livelihoods.</div>

AI in the current economic system has a very real risk of being a tool of economic and political repression. Someone who can't afford a home or a meal doesn't give a shit if AI taxi's have reduced the accident rate, or that a company has improved profits by automating call centres. They care that they can't sleep or eat, and that work doesn't resolve that problem. 

Until governments force companies to share all of the benefits of AI more equitably, people are right to worry about poor outcomes for themselves. 

Is an AI Skynet uprising more or less likely than companies using AI to fire so many workers that the economy collapses? Hmmmm</div>

Like, I don't think most people have an issue with AI that diagnoses cancer with greater accuracy or AI that helps develop a new therapeutic for Alzheimer's. I would love to live in a world where self-driving cars reduce traffic fatalities by 99%. When people sneer at AI they're sneering at "generative AI" and there's plenty of valid reasons for this response.</div>

Are people aware of how shallow their roots are ? Yes, I'm talking about american indian or "natives" and how everyone's a migrant in the grand scheme of things. It's not because it's an old point that we should just ignore it.

I understand trying to deal with the crime waves and the "bad culture" coming from Mexico, it sounds racist but at least it's real, not like that obsession with illegal migrant stuff that makes no sense.

Trump is really living in his own world and doing his own things now killing the global market, gifting big corpos and billionaire, and spending billions on illegal migrants like it's going to make a difference.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I had Vercel v0-1.5-lg, Claude, Grok3, and GPT4.1-nano; 

Task was a "Tower Defense Game in Unity/C#"  

Vercel was the only true working game example, 2 weapons multiple waves everything.  
Claude tried, but had issues, getting a full functioning result.  

Grok3 was able to get a basic basic structure but no effective logic.  
  
GPT4.1-nano gave the *I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that* - Response  
  
Overall I'm very impressed, But even doing this, I realize that overall I still think GPT is the best because it solves for the problem I have. It's bar none the most cost-effective of all of them.  
30/month and basically unlimited inputs.  

While I may lose on time and accuracy, it's fast enough and accurate enough to get me the results I need.  
I'm just personally too "scared" to use something like Claude/Vercel where the credits can add up really quickly with the amount of input/output I'm getting out them;  
With Open AI, I'm basically using to the limit on the higher end models.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’ve been running some research with agents lately, and I can tell you that memory is a big limitation. Not recall, but contextual and procedural memory. What to do, when, and why. Causality and planning. We need separate modules not only for handling specific roles but also to assist the core LLM with those cognitive functions that simply flashing through the context window via a couple hundred heads of attention won’t enable.

I believe these capabilities are already within reach and there’s a lot of research being done in that direction. But we still insist on wanting a single model to be ASI 🙄</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm no expert, but it seems clear that one of the biggest limitations in current AI systems is memory. You can have brilliant reasoning capabilities, but if you constantly forget what just happened or can’t retain more than a sliver of context at a time, you're practically useless for most complex tasks. Genius with short memory is like a calculator with no screen -- technically capable, but ultimately not very useful.

Running a business, for example, is easily one of the top ten most demanding things an average person could attempt. It’s not just hard, it’s a relentless juggling act of priorities, decisions, systems, and human factors. You need to track dozens of variables in parallel, make long-term plans, and adapt to constant change. That’s not something you can do if your memory resets every few seconds/minutes. 

That’s why testing AI on real-world, high-complexity tasks like running a business is promising. It gives us a much clearer picture of what these systems can actually do, far more than acing theoretical benchmarks in math, code or science (not that those don't matter, of course). It looks like an excellent benchmark that will be very hard to beat in less than 5 years because even humans *really* struggle with that in real life, it's genuinely challenging.

Maybe it's time we rethink the mantra. If “attention is all you need” got us this far, perhaps the next breakthrough is “memory, adaptability and context are all you need.” AI has learned to think. Now it needs to *remember* and *adapt* if it ever wants to *act*.</div>

As an AI researcher myself I would be extremely surprised if there is no AGI by late 2027 and I would be willing to bet my life and existence on the fact that we will have AGI by 2030.</div>

It turns out that in my country, there is a minimum number of guests, because their needs to be two witnesses for the marriage to be legal, so my dad had to dash outside mid-service and drag a passer-by into the wedding to act as a witness.

Like many kids, she doesn’t really take parental advice seriously, especially when it comes from me.

I tried to share what I’ve learned over the years about car buying, but she brushed it off.

Then she made the classic mistake: she went to the dealership “just to look.”

                <div class="post-content">Hi everyone, I am 46 years old man, and I have never exercised before. Do you think I can start crossfit at this age? Or I better forget about it and just regular gym.

I was thinking using a crossfit gym bear my home with instructors to start low and increase intensity slowly for my age. 

What is your advice? </div>

Also was the CEO of TAG (his father founded it), which still owns a sizable share in the McLaren group.

That all fell apart as team performance deteriorated in the late 2000s and early 2010s, daimler bought (and later sold before they brought brawn) a significant portion of the tag-mclaren group, whitmarsh was a friend of Ojjeh who was removed while Ojjeh was hospitalized, Dennis sued and failed somewhere later

He passed away a few years back but it is a big part of why this is the collection to have. Arguably one of the few justified garage queens because none of those cars would exist without him, they are simply trophies</div>

EDIT: Also, as a side note-- assuming OAI employees are working 5 days every week, this means they're working 16 hours everyday. Holy shit.</div>

**Mark Chen, the** chief research officer at OpenAI, sent a forceful memo to staff on Saturday, promising to go head-to-head with the social giant in the war for top research talent. This memo, which was sent to OpenAI employees in Slack and obtained by WIRED, came days after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg successfully recruited [four senior researchers](https://www.wired.com/story/four-openai-researchers-leave-meta/) from the company to join Meta’s superintelligence lab.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">"Unlimited vacation days" is another way for employers to save money because when an employee leaves, they don't have to pay them for their unused vacation time.

It's also a great way for managers to pressure employees into not using any vacation time, because are you all caught up on your work? Are your coworkers all going on vacation too? Don't you have a performance review coming up? Hmmm.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I guess it really depends on your manager and the company, but I've been working with a company that has unlimited vacation(the first three weeks you request, they can't deny it) and after that it's by the manager's discretion. Usually I take a month and a half to two month vacations a year. The key is to space it out, but I've never had a vacation denied. It could work either way though. However, they can't retract it since it's in my contract, otherwise it would count as a legal dismissal.</div>

First I asked it to just rename, organize and properly structure the notes and then asked it to make useful and meaningful connections for graph view in Obsidian. It nailed it perfectly and what's unbelievable is it did it with 90% context window always remaining free.

I'd say accuracy is approximately 95% which cab be made 100% for sure if you tell it to read the Full Files. It'd take significantly more time though (around 2 Hours for the same task).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">OP's post reminds me of what was said in the late 1980s/early 1990s when the HGP (Human Genome Project) was started. 

It's goal was to map and sequence the whole human genome, in the hope of curing all diseases (which were thought to be caused by genes only).

It succeeded in mapping the human genome... but it failed in curing any disease. Turns out diseases were much *much* more complex than mere genome data, irreducibly so. Diseases came from multiple infinitesimal small nudges and interactions from the whole organism with its environment, which sometimes involved multiple genes (there was the belief that each disease had a single gene) and their interaction with an environmental disturbance breaking homeostasis, etc.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS4wKpK37NY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS4wKpK37NY)

Here, simulating a cell will definitely be quite helpful, just like the HGP, in *understanding the human body* better, which *in turn* will lead to better medecine, *on the long run*.

But claiming it'll find whole cures for diseases is overly optimistic and bombastic. We already do experiments in vitro *on actual living cells*. They're never sufficient and only a first step before experiments *in vivo*.

Again, don't get me wrong, simulating cells will be insanely helpful. But cells aren't whole human bodies.

I wish such CEOs would just promote the actual realistic benefits of what they're developping instead of over hyping stuff. Things as they are already are exciting enough.
