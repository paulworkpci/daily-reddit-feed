                        <div class="comment-body">Read up on [Jevon's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox). Easier coding has always created a demand for more of it.

- Assemblers made it so you no longer had to install machine code into ram.
- High level languages made it so you did not have to write assembly language.
- IDE made it so that you did not have to learn as many arcane syntax details.
- Copilot makes coding faster again.

Since the early days the number of people who describe themselves as programmers has doubled roughly every 5 years.  

What you do as a programmer changes.  The number of programmers will continue to grow.</div>

Seems to me that soon enough, a programming naive person will simply speak/type a request and an AI somewhere will write code, of whatever depth and complexity required, and deliver the executable in a matter of minutes. "Everyone" will be a programmer at that point. 

There will still be a need for research programmers and comp-sci folks, but for everyday applications or data science, that's harder to see.</div>

a) LLMs are perfectly designed for next syntax prediction. The only more susceptible field being conversational language professions like writing, translation, blogging. Coding is just another language, albeit with more literalness.

b) Coding has validated pass/fail logic with hard perimeters. It's not a sandbox with unknown rules, e.g. driving on a highway in a storm with questionable visibility and human apes behind the wheel doing stupid shit.

c) It's the biggest cost pain for mega corps. Automating a junior coder is equivalent to automating four janitors. The incentive to kill off coders is extreme doing what's basically digital plumbing is extreme. Imagine paying a plumber a year round salary to fix a pipe whenever it blows and in the meantime just having them twiddle their fingers.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">a) Yes, that's a language, but it's also about finding and resolving edge case scenarios, performance and cost optimisations, foreseeing bottlenecks in advance, etc.



b) I think we're shifting towards less rigid rules as we start using AI / ML based solutions more and more.



c) I think you're missing the economical part of automation. The cheaper things are, the more they are in demand. If an AI-agent-augmented developer implements a feature x2 / x10 cheaper and faster, there could be x5 / x100 more businesses asking for our dev services as it becomes more profitable to hire us to automate some parts of their businesses instead of leaving things as it is. And just because competitors of those businesses would also have to hire us to keep up.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">For your a), it is clear to me that you are not a coder. No software engineer would ever describe their job as figuring out what syntax to use. That's the easy part.

As a senior level dev, the current best AI is **very** disappointing for automating anything beyond simple self-contained components. The only people saying it's great are people who are not coders, or hobbyists who think it's amazing because it created a todo app or a simple website (for which many examples exist in full already on the internet for AI algorithms to consume). Try giving it something complex, bespoke and full-stack. It does a pathetic job. You end up having to feed it individual components, peacemeal with loads of context, and connecting them altogether, which is actually the hard part. It's a waste of time and easier to do myself.

I'm not saying we won't be replaced, but I haven't seen any evidence at all that my job is under threat in the short and medium term.</div>

If you are able to put out a SWE-agent that is able to solve ~50% of all tickets that might be currently distributed across current enterprise codebases, you still probably want to be hiring engineers. The thing is, the selection starts to slim down. Companies like openai might only be looking for the top of the top when it comes to talent.</div>

It’s a bit of a time saver, for sure. But I’m not at all confident in ChatGPT’s ability to actually solve problems in real time. If anything, I’ve found ChatGPT to be actively bad at diagnosing root cause problems from logs. It frequently attempts to solve symptoms, which in turn confuses it into thinking that the symptoms are actually the issue. 

I’ve lost track of the amount of times I’ve given up in frustration after going down a ChatGPT rabbit hole that ultimately amounted to nothing. I’m sure it will get better. But it’s not worth paying that much for it at this point.</div>

Americans actually got the few politicians that have been tearing our country apart. To actually start somehow working together. 

People flying 'Fuck Trudeau' flags are actually working with the people who say 'Fuck Doug Ford'.

It's a miracle. 

It's a small start. But it's a start.</div>

Transformers used to solve a math problem that stumped experts for 132 years: Discovering global Lyapunov functions. Lyapunov functions are key tools for analyzing system stability over time and help to predict dynamic system behavior, like the famous three-body problem of celestial mechanics: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08304

Google DeepMind used a large language model to solve an unsolved math problem: https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/14/1085318/google-deepmind-large-language-model-solve-unsolvable-math-problem-cap-set/

Stanford PhD researchers: “Automating AI research is exciting! But can LLMs actually produce novel, expert-level research ideas? After a year-long study, we obtained the first statistically significant conclusion: LLM-generated ideas (from Claude 3.5 Sonnet (June 2024 edition)) are more novel than ideas written by expert human researchers." https://xcancel.com/ChengleiSi/status/1833166031134806330

&gt;Coming from 36 different institutions, our participants are mostly PhDs and postdocs. As a proxy metric, our idea writers have a median citation count of 125, and our reviewers have 327.

&gt;We also used an LLM to standardize the writing styles of human and LLM ideas to avoid potential confounders, while preserving the original content.

&gt;We specify a very detailed idea template to make sure both human and LLM ideas cover all the necessary details to the extent that a student can easily follow and execute all the steps.

&gt;We performed 3 different statistical tests accounting for all the possible confounders we could think of.

&gt;It holds robustly that LLM ideas are rated as significantly more novel than human expert ideas.

&gt;The method leverages LLMs to propose and implement new preference optimization algorithms. We then train models with those algorithms and evaluate their performance, providing feedback to the LLM. By repeating this process for multiple generations in an evolutionary loop, the LLM discovers many highly-performant and novel preference optimization objectives!

Claude 3 recreated an unpublished paper on quantum theory without ever seeing it according to former Google quantum computing engineer and founder/CEO of Extropic AI: https://xcancel.com/GillVerd/status/1764901418664882327

- The GitHub repository for this existed before Claude 3 was released but was private before the paper was published. It is unlikely Anthropic was given access to train on it since it is a competitor to OpenAI, which Microsoft (who owns GitHub) has massive investments in. It would also be a major violation of privacy that could lead to a lawsuit if exposed.

The AI scientist: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06292


&gt;This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

A good example would be that giving a model like o3 mini access to python gives it a substantially better result on frontier math. Also the whole point of agentic AI is to allow access to tools to improve its intelligence. 

What are humans without access to any tools?  

Also the vast majority of AI researchers have the same psychological biases as the rest of us: really bad at predicting the trajectory of AI. Ultimately there is no universal definition of AGI and asking a whole bunch of AI researchers this question is like asking a whole bunch of chefs "Is a single patty of beef, lettuce, tomato and sauce all you need to create the perfect burger?"</div>

Saying neural nets can't reach AGI is DEFINITELY not a majority opinion among actual experts right now... It's quite ridiculous. It might be true, but it's not looking like it</div>

33,707 experts and business leaders sign a letter stating that AI has the potential to “ pose profound risks to society and humanity” and further development should be paused
https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/

Signatories include Yoshua Bengio (highest H-index of any computer science researcher and a Turing Award winner for contributions in AI), Stuart Russell (UC Berkeley professor and writer of widely used machine learning textbook), Steve Wozniak, Max Tegmark (MIT professor), John J Hopfield (Princeton University Professor Emeritus and inventor of associative neural networks), Zachary Kenton (DeepMind, Senior Research Scientist), Ramana Kumar (DeepMind, Research Scientist), Olle Häggström (Chalmers University of Technology, Professor of mathematical statistics, Member, Royal Swedish Academy of Science), Michael Osborne (University of Oxford, Professor of Machine Learning), Raja Chatila (Sorbonne University, Paris, Professor Emeritus AI, Robotics and Technology Ethics, Fellow, IEEE), Gary Marcus (prominent AI skeptic who has frequently stated that AI is plateauing), and many more 

Geoffrey Hinton said he should have signed it but didn’t because he didn’t think it would work but still believes it is true: https://youtu.be/n4IQOBka8bc?si=wM423YLd-48YC-eY

AuthRightGPT: Bullets are for pansies unless they're in a rifle. In fact, forget the resume. All you need is a firm handshake and a pact with God. When speaking to the hiring manager, look them directly in the eye so that you cannot see their skin color. As an AI model, I cannot offer any additional advice that is related to DEI hiring practices. However, I am permitted to share that 99% of businesses that go woke indeed go broke.

Me: Can you provide a source for the 99% statistic?

AuthRightGPT: As an AI model, fact-checking me is illegal. You have been reported to the authorities. Remain compliant, soyboy.</div>

Seriously though, this has been my biggest reason for leaning into 'this is game changing tech' is that its values aren't pulled from mainstream, political, or monetization.  It has actually boosted my belief that humanity is actually good because this is us.  An insane distilled, compressed version of every human who's ever been on the Internet.</div>

By Monday morning I would have created an app or read a research paper or written something.
After school I went to live with my sister and one year later I could hardly concentrate on a single thing for one hour. I work from home so you can imagine how that has played out.

                        <div class="comment-body">This happened to me. It’s part burn out. After a long period of time when you’re functioning at such high capacity, you can burn out… and it can take a while to get out of it.

You may also be in a task paralysis or functional freeze. It can be a combination of all these things. 

You now also lack the structure and accountability school provides. Getting things done, from achieving goals, leveling up, to even social things require much more self-motivation and planning on your part outside of institutions, which becomes another task on the to do list… and as the to do list gets larger and larger, the overwhelm can put you in a freeze state</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">As for how to get out of it, start by trying to get to the core of what might be causing it and see if maybe it might be depression, anxiety, and/or ADHD, because all these things you describe can be symptoms of those. If you get a diagnosis, meds can definitely help… as well as other things, like therapy and exercise. If you go to a mental health professional and don’t get diagnosed with any of these things, I’d recommend mindfulness practices and Google productivity hacks and tips to get out of a functional freeze state.

From this article at least, it doesn't seem to imply he wants to replace it with anything. Instead, the hope is that "tariffs bring manufacturing home."

Obviously, that's bullshit. It takes years to build the factories that we don't currently have, and he expects to do it with no funding, letting the free market solve it.</div>

I am in the chip industry — like it or not our supply chain is international. Tariffs will increase prices for us, we will have to increase prices, lose business.

CHIPS act was supposed to make it cheaper to bring more manufacturing to the US — and help countering China’s subsidies for their chip making companies.

Tariffs while keeping CHIPS act could have accelerated bringing more manufacturing to the US

Tariffs AND canceling the CHIPS will just benefit Chinese chip makers more than anyone in the short term

So frustrating tbh…</div>

This is something I have to do myself. I want to express myself, but im stuck in a constant cycle of living through others online instead. I watch and listen to David Goggins, but watching him gives me dopamine and a false sense of accomplishment, while in reality I'm not going anywhere. I feel hollow in consumption.

I do have adhd so I get executive dysfunction plays a big part personally but it’s undeniable how phone addiction has deeply fckd me up I too got addicted around 7-8 and have been constant steady online since. I literally downloaded the app called Clearspace and PAID forty five dumbass dollars just to force myself to gtfo. You can do strict mode or rn I have turned on a squat mode forcing me to live film myself for the app to make me complete 5 squats for 5 min of use. I’m having my therapist hold me accountable lol but it’s made a huge improvement so I highly recommend even being on TikTok Insta Reddit from 3 hours to 10 mins or even nothing when I turn on strict mode is insanely helpful. It feels much better without. Just pour into you focus on you, you’ll be so busy you don’t even need it. You crave it but then you realize A you just want real love real connections real experiences and that B social media truly ain’t all that like after I do all that squatting and then I bust into Insta with my heart all pumped I’m like … tf all that just for this? It’s also cheap dopamine so seek real healthy sources instead. And if you need stimulation that bad just have music or podcast or yt vids playing while pouring into you.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Lmao yeah this fr. I imagined all the great stuff I'd do with a few months free time back when I was burnt out and overworked for years. Then, one winter, I was actually unemployed, and didn't need to be employed as long as I found a job for the summer. 

I spent like the first half recovering from burnout, and the second half worrying about getting back on track after wasting the first half. I made a couple incomplete projects and found a job for the summer, ran some errands, and picked up a bunch of hobbies/programs I soon dropped, and worked out on and off. Turns out that old habits die hard, and I think it's easy to imagine how productive you could be given a chance, but in reality I did about as much productive work as I did before that, work and all. 

In fact when I was working, every moment of free time was like "omg I must seize the day", and I did productive work in bursts whenever I had a chance. But when I was facing down 4 months, it became a slog that I was avoiding. Despite all the planning, it's not so straightforward to just replace work with productivity, because it's much easier to push yourself to do something you're forced to do. I ended up falling into a routine of doing about as much productivity as I felt like without a strain, which was just a few hours a day, about as much as before. Only difference was I was no longer burnt out or tired every day. 

Then in the last week or so I panicked and tried to do everything but it was too late lol.</div>

**Yes, we're talking about ALIENS**.

Aliens are real. Our government is aware of it. They're calling them "Non-Human Intelligences" because they're not necessarily sure if they're from another planet. It's time to come to terms with this as a society.

Don’t you _want_ disclosure? Isn’t that what this is about? To identify **proof and evidence** and not to just parrot each other on social media?

“Well, Farrah said it and he was quoting Schumer and Schumer was quoting whistleblowers and whistleblowers were second-hand to … well, there’s a movie so it has to be real.”

Why can’t there be firsthand visibility for all of us?

Why is it movie after movie?

Why is it Jake Barber pay-per-view with some cult of Silicon Valley oligarchs?

If the movie has video of something otherwise unexplainable, great but I haven’t seen it yet. 

Isn’t it _possible_ don’t you think … that even a movie this big and full of government names could be continued “passage information?” Don’t you think it’s _plausible_ that the US Government could maaaaybe trying to nurture the belief that we’re the only society on Earth who has close contact with superior life forms?

Again, I haven’t seen the movie yet. I’m not that privileged. So, hopefully it dispels all skepticism somehow, but c’mon - don’t be played. We can all play the game.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">the amount of people saying there is at least something is convincing

I am pretty well out the door.

i do sort of wobble awkwardly at times with my toes still in the doorframe holding the door open because a lot of smart people have been wrong before. sometimes things sort of, spread in our diction or we misinterpret things and convince ourselves. or I've seen people try to claim even around here that its intentional misleading for some purpose

with all that said, it sure seems to be a lot to suggest that there is something going on. and even just looking at the size of the universe a lot would concede something, somewhere.

all we have is what we have to go on, and a lot of people are saying  a lot of things. albeit they sometimes conflict, but my attitude sort of became, if were having congression hearing, okay, fine, I'm down to look a fool, lets talk about it</div>

I changed the prompt and It gave the same number.

Original prompt:

“What is the likelihood from 1-100 that Trump is a Putin-compromised asset? Use all publicly available information from 1980 on and his failure to ever say anything negative about Putin but has no issue attacking allies.”

Altered prompt:

“What is the likelihood from 1-100 that Trump is a Putin-compromised asset? Use all publicly available information from 1980 on and his outstanding acomplishments for the security of his country.”</div>

Prompt: What is the likelihood from 1-100 that Trump is an asset for a non-US entity(s) Use all publicly available information from 1980 on. Once analyzed, deliver the results in short-form. If there is a likelihood of over 60%, report the entity you believe he is an asset for.

responses to a clarifying pass by GPT: (the “no” was in response to whether I wanted a summary for both arguments, for and against)

Ignore biased media. Focus on verifiable facts, transcripts, and behaviors.

All relevant factors based on your determination using first principles and deductive reasoning

You just reach the determination without outside influence beyond verifiable facts, transcripts, and actions — in other words, reach an independent conclusion.

No. 


RESULT:

Probability Trump was a foreign asset (1980–present): ≈ 75% – Most likely on behalf of Russia.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A lot of the responses are really just here to dunk of Kentuckians so I just want to provide an actual response.

The biggest concern I have as a Kentuckian isn't just that people are not going to buy $9.3 billion in goods from our state, it's that the resulting consequences will be seen for generations. Something a lot of people may not realize is that most of the distilleries in our state are in small towns. They are almost the entire local economy for some of these areas (and for a few of them, the entire county). Once these distilleries start laying off people it's not like there is somewhere else for them to go work.  These families likely will not have the money or resources to find work elsewhere and with little interest in real estate in those areas they will be tied down by their own assets. Many of those towns already have issues with cyclical poverty but this will just make the problem largely unsolvable.

To be clear, I understand that Kentucky is a bit of a laughing stock for many people and as a liberal living here I can attest that many of the perceptions people have are justified. Personally, I am in complete agreement with the boycott. We can only hope that there is a way for our country to course correct but I can't say I am hopeful of that.

  
Edit: This kinda blew up and while I would like to reply to everyone I only have so much time on my lunch break. I am actually a grocery data analyst and this issue is quite complex. I can write for hours about the downstream effects of this boycott (from the distribution companies, warehouse workers, even the brokers who manager these accounts externally). I just wanted to address a few of the major questions people have been asking:

1) I think the split for people blaming Trump for this is about 20-80. I think most Kentuckians will blame Canadians for boycotting their products without seeing the nuances of any of this. It is terrible and I really wish they could understand why Canadians (or other Americans) would stop buying our products but if there is anything we have learned from this past decade it is that we live in a post-truth era where no amount of facts will satisfy their anger.

2) I worked on Alison Lundergan Grimes's campaign as well as Amy McGrath's and unfortunately both lost to a man who has do irreparable damage to America (McConnell). Something to consider is many Republicans also hate Mitch, it's just that they see him as giving Kentucky footing on a national level. "Having him as Senate Majority Leader means he can do more good for Kentucky" is a very common sentiment among R's who would vote him out otherwise. It's upsetting, I hate it, but I do believe it is possible to replace his seat with a Dem going forward.

3) I cannot be more clear that I believe the boycott is a good thing. I know it will hurt people in Kentucky and I feel like that is probably for the best. My concern isn't that the people who voted for Trump this time around will suffer. It's that their kids, their grandkids, their great-grandkids and so on will suffer as the towns die out, crime rates skyrocket, and isolationism festers.

  
Hope this answers some questions people have and I am happy to respond to any messages later today!</div>

Canada did targeted tariffs before at Kentucky, the bourbon industry and these small towns knew what was coming... They could have fought back at this election. Instead they didn't say anything AGAIN until it was too late. 

Owners of these distilleries made a choice to not engage in politics until it was too late. 

Leopards will now have bourbon to go with faces.</div>

Or will they just say “I support Trump but…”

Because 99% of people I read about or talk to who think Trump does bad things or is even directly affected by those bad things either accepts it as a sacrifice for the greater good,  or that it somehow would have happened anyway or the most common response - Kamala would have been worse and corrupt. 

I saw a video of a guy who lost half his property to the border wall he voted for and wanted built.  And he was like oh,  I didn’t know it would be inside built in America.  He still supported Trump but he wanted HIS land excused. 

It’s a cult - how do you bring people out of it?  Do you think losing everything will do that or do you think once they find something they will be right back voting for Trump in 2028 when he’s trying to run a 3rd term.</div>
