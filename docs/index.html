lol

Have none of these people ever organized ANYTHING? Yes, if you have protests, you often will have suggested chants. I have been organizing union picket lines for many years, and we pretty much always have prepared chants printed out. People also spontaneously come up with new ones, and when they're catchy they go onto the next chant sheet. This is evidence that people are organizing these protests, not that people are paid to attend them. Anyone with the slightest experience of the real world and more than 2 brain cells to rub together would know this. 

What's next? Are hymnals now proof that people are paid to attend church?</div>

They picked Rosa to do the job because of optics.  They picked the time, place, bus number, had her fine and bail money ready, and her lawyers and their fees all arranged ahead if time.

That‚Äôs how you protest to get results, you organize.

She wasn‚Äôt paid for her actions, but even if she was paid for her trouble of getting arrested, going to jail it, etc., it doesn‚Äôt mean that the protest wasn‚Äôt organic.  She, and the organizers, still cared very much about the cause (civil rights).</div>

Nothing about it violates content guidelines 

But again and again 

New chat after new chat 

I can't even complain about the content guidelines because they're so strict!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">What's even more annoying imo is that, presumably since OpenAI is adjusting them on the fly, the guidelines aren't actually posted anywhere, and even the model isn't fed the guidelines. From all appearances it just gets flagged for content policy with no additional information for you or the responding model. You can ask the model, but the answer it gives is most definitely a hallucination (meaning if you ask for an adjustment to conform to policy, it too will be blocked since the model doesn't actually know what was wrong with it in the first place).

It would be so much better if they published their policy, or at least fed it to ChatGPT along with the image block,  then if anything you could ask ChatGPT to modify your prompt to conform to the policy if needed. 

As it is, we're forced to tip toe around an invisible minefield that could change at any time.</div>

contrary to what all the talking heads on 24-hour news say America did quite well for itself being the center of the world's attention for the last hundred years. it's our fault for setting up a unregulated system that allowed the rich to capture all that wealth well letting the poor become more poor. 

we are going to do even worse under the system where even our closest trade allies look overseas.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Remember that the official story is that a random McDonald‚Äôs employee recognized him from this photo, reported him to police, and the police actually came and were able to judge that he was in fact, the killer.

If you need help understanding the absurdity of this, let me break it down.

Would a random teen be able to recognize Luigi based on this photo? Unlikely 
Would a random teen be in support of the insurance companies and want to turn him in? Unlikely 
Would the cops take it seriously enough to immediately go there and investigate even tho I‚Äôm sure they got hundreds of fake phone calls from people saying they found the killer? Unlikely 
Once confronted would Luigi then hand them the fake id he used to conceal his identity? That doesn‚Äôt even make sense.

And no one even talks about this</div>

Is there any way of doing the equivalent in the app? Tried looking around the search filters, but I'm not sure I saw anything like that. Thanks in advance!

Edit: From the answers I'm getting, there does not seem  to be a similar workaround in the app itself. Browser it is,  then. Thanks all!</div>

Around that time, I was introduced to¬†The Shallows¬†by Nicholas Carr. I read it and it affected me profoundly. I took action immediately. There was an internal voice that said it had to be done if I wanted to live a successful life. I don't know what compelled me to do that at such a young age but it's been the best decision i've made.

I just want to share that...</div>

It‚Äôs hard because we have evolved cognitive mechanisms that prioritize attention to negative information‚Äîaka negativity bias.¬†It's believed that it's because our desire to survive, we became very aware of threats and negative things. The amygdala, a brain region responsible for processing emotions like fear, plays a significant role in this heightened sensitivity to negative stimuli.¬†‚Äã[Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/putting-psychology-into-practice/202502/why-were-drawn-to-bad-news?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Since we aren't surviving anymore and we're just on our phones in the convenience of our home. News often emphasizes the bad or sensational stories to capture attention, which can lead to increased stress and anxiety.¬†At the end of the day thats all it is. How can we capture your attention, regardless of any consequence. But we just simply haven't evolved fast enough to deal with this much information, let alone tis much negative information. ¬†‚Äã[Sage Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20413866241232138?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Then, in the run up to the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, it really hit me that politics has become a spectator sport as much as anything. I know people say it is important to pay attention to politics, that it affects your life, but it is difficult to have any impact at all, and that time is generally better spent locally improving the lives of others and the community as a whole on a volunteer basis.

                                <div class="reply-body">I fully deactivated my snap, fb, ig, Pinterest account. Never had twitter and TikTok.   
For me, cold turkey worked best and for the longest time. Some argue groupchats on platforms is what keeps them on. Friend connections keep them on. Nah. Prior to the last 30 years humans lived without internet and social media, we don't need to know what happens to people everyday and those that you do care about probably text you.

  
I kinda slowly introduced what I "wanted" back slowly. I dont need anything but I found fb marketplace useful so I have that now. YouTube then became my main social media when I deleted everything else. Its funny, our brain loves the path of least resistance, so rather than reading i'll watch hour long YouTube.  Spent quite a bit of time on that until I discovered [Focus for YouTube](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focus-for-youtube/id1514703160?mt=12). I blocked homepage, recommended and that did numbers on me. I have no watched history and turned off every thing YouTube can track. This made it harder for them to feed me videos to stay on their platform. I can only use it for my subscription feed and or what I intentionally wanted to watch.  

But for me, it's all about willpower on YouTube, I only subscribed to educational content. That was my justification anyways, at the end of the day it's still consumption but hey I'd rather try to understand quantum mechanics than baby shark videos. Whether it's cocomelon or PBS space-time. And YOU KNOW I BE WATCHING ~~COCOMELON~~   PBS SPACETIME, I still have a time limit. Youtube is set to 1hr a day.  The goal was always to make as much friction as possible making it hard for me to use. 

Another thing I'd do is 45 mins before bed I'd always put my phone across the room. I actually don't ever charge my phone at the house, I now charge it on the drive to someplace that's how little I really use it nowadays. 

Meaningful friction my friend. Find ways to create as many as possible.</div>

I know it‚Äôs not straightforward since the model just outputs pixels, but they have have lots of training data from layered files, so they could convert it after it‚Äôs generated

it's probably hard to do, but it doesn‚Äôt seem harder than what they‚Äôve already achieved. they could even make the model output whole fonts, allowing you to edit the text in the image.

All of this is slowly rolling out with MCP and reasoning models, but we are still nowhere near just being able to give the AI a complex task, walking away for two weeks and then getting something finished, useful and polished in return. The models are really got at all the individual small steps in a process, but the larger picture is still largely absent, especially in the freely accessible stuff.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I find the idea of an AGI that is not embedded and (in some sense) embodied in an environment (virtual or otherwise) to be a fool's errand, tbh.

How can something be generally intelligent if it only exists once someone presses enter and only learns when someone runs the "learning" algorithm? 

People get overly focused on the words that make out the acronym rather than the historicity of the term. AGI is about solving what was originally called the Strong AI problem. A machine that proves Hobbs is right and Decartes is wrong.

We can achieve very strong AI without ever having AGI. It is unknown if AGI is even *possible*. And in no way is AGI supposed to be the next step in commercial AIs. That would either be *slavery* or *a new independent race* and one is disgusting while the other is bad for business. I think companies should really be trying their hardest to creat ASIs that are *not* AGIs, if the goal is maximizing profit and utility for humans. 

A general problem solver and the quest for AGI is useful for Cognitive Science research. Companies are throwing around the term AGI so much that I'm fairly certain Cognitive Science research will be coming up with a new acronym soon. Maybe Conscious AI or something.</div>

Now, imagine these researcher agents have control over the infrastructure they're using to run experiments and improve upon them -- suddenly you have the sort of recursive tinderbox you'd need to actually allow an AGI to grow itself into ASI.

Compare this to humans needing to go through entire graduate programs, post-graduate programs, publishing, reading, iterating in real-time at a human pace.

                        <div class="comment-body">I still like Leopold Aschenbrenner's prediction. Once we successfully automate AI research itself, we may experience a dramatic growth in algorithmic efficiency in one year, taking us from AGI to ASI.

I believe there are something like only &lt;5,000 or so top level AI researchers on earth (meaning people who are very influential for their achievements and contributions to AI science). Imagine an AGI that can replicate that, now you have a billion of them operating at 1,000 the speed of a normal human.

A billion top level AI researchers operating at 1,000x the speed of a normal human 24/7 is the equivalent of about \~3 trillion human equivalent years worth of top level AI research condensed into one year, vs the 5,000 human equivalent years worth we have now.

I say 3 trillion instead of 1 trillion because assume a human top level AI researcher works \~60 hours a week, so maybe \~3000 hours a year. An AI researcher will work 24/7/365, so 8760 hours a year.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The limiting factor will be physical experimentation.

We had a big debate between the rationalists, who believed that all knowledge could be logically deducted, and the empiricists, who recognized that there are multiple logically possible but contradictory configurations the world can be in and out is only through empirical observations that we can determine which configuration it is in, during the 1700's and science has definitively shown that the empiricists were correct. 

This means that the AI will be and to logically infer possible truths but that, for at least some subset, it will need to perform real world experiments to identify which of the truths are actualized. We don't know exactly how far pure reason can take us and an ASI will almost certainly be more capable than we are, but it is glaringly obvious that there will need to be experiments to discover all of science. These experiments will take time and will thus be the bottleneck.</div>

But the fine print is more nefarious. The ability to register to vote will become much harder (particularly for married women). So if your intention is to suppress certain votes, what better way to do it than enact laws requiring unnecessary paperwork and then have DOGE kneecap the agencies that issue them.¬†


It would also lend credence to the lie that millions of illegals vote. No, it's not that only half of Americans have a passport and even fewer have the $180 to obtain one. No, it's not that the name on a birth certificate doesn't match a married woman's ID. They'll claim it's because they made voting sooo safe, that the millions of immigrants who risk actual jail time to vote illegally decided that *this* is the election they'll sit out. But not the one with the candidate who said they'd send them to a concentration camp...


All I know is people who think Trump is trolling with his third term remarks are delusional. After January 6th, it's pretty clear than man isn't leaving the White House of his own volition.¬†</div>

&gt;***The lawmakers were also keen to connect on some of their ‚Äúbiggest concerns about expectations management,‚Äù in the context of their constituents‚Äô demands for government documentation and oversight for UAP-related projects and materials, according to Elizondo.***

&gt;***‚ÄúI‚Äôve said before that disclosure and transparency is a process ‚Äî it‚Äôs not an event ‚Äî meaning you‚Äôre going to be sadly disappointed if you think all the revelations are going to be provided all at once. Congress is very concerned. They want to make sure that the American people know this is just step one in a multi-step process to give the American people what they want and what they deserve,‚Äù he told DefenseScoop.***

Even if they were tinkered with, had a different firmware or anything similar, they still could be traced,  for fuck's sake they couldn't even jam them lol.  

Plus, there's more stuff that doesn't make sense. And any time i thought i had an idea on what are the drones or their intentions, even more questions appeared.</div>

Not long ago, one of the most recent ones was "whenever it can pass the Bar exam" all the way up until LLMs crushed the exam. Then it was "when they can score above N% on ARC-AGI" and then when they started getting 80%+ on that, they made an ARC-AGI 2 which is orders of magnitude more difficult. Now that they beat the Turing test, who knows what it'll be next, lol.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I wonder who these people are lol. I just went to my GPT-4.5 and asked it to act humanlike and I was going to try to talk to it and it's goal was to pass the Turing test, and it did a horrible job. It said it was ready, and so I asked, how you doin, and it responded "haha, pretty good, just enjoying the chat! how about you?" like could you be more ChatGPT if you tried? Enjoying the chat? We just started!

Sometimes I wonder if the average random person from the population just has nothing going on behind their eyes. How are they being tricked by GPT 4.5? Or I am just bad at prompting, I dunno.

Edit: for those wondering about the persona, if you scroll past the main results in the paper, the persona instructions are in the appendix. Noteworthy that they **instructed the LLM to use less than 5 words, talk like a 19 year old, and say "I don't know"**.

The results are impressive but it does put them into context. It's passing a Turing test by being instructed to give minimal responses. I think it would be a lot harder to pass the test if the setting were, say, talking in depth about interests. This setup basically sidesteps that issue by instructing the LLM to use very short responses.</div>

Maybe it‚Äôs the nostalgia talking, but I remember life feeling richer and more satisfying before I had the interne...</div>

Other ideas: start a creative writing habit with daily handwritten pages or drawings, listen to an audiobook or podcast, crochet or knit, do some guided meditations. ¬†

That sounds like a lovely morning practice and I hope you find something really rewarding to do.¬†</div>

Depending on where you live, maybe think about something that gets you looking outside more, like setting up a bird feeder or butterfly feeder. 

Or maybe instead of a visual replacement, think auditory. Listen to music, an audiobook, or a podcast.</div>

Also, it's funny how TV used to be the "opiate of the masses" before social media, and now people frequently tell people to watch TV instead of scrolling!</div>

I don't like waking up in the morning but every productivity guru was saying to wakeup at 5:00 AM. I tried for a long time but I hated it. So about six months ago, I decided to try something completely different: embracing my natural laziness

The results honestly surprised me. Here's what I did:

People suck. People lie, cheat, mock, and belittle you for little to no reason; they cannot understand you, or you them, and they demand things or time or energy from you. Ultimately, all human relations are fragile, impermanent, and even dangerous. I hardly have to go into examples, but divorce? Harassments? Bullying? Hate? Mockery? Deception? One-upmanship? Conflict of all sorts? Apathy?

People lie, cheat, mock, and belittle you for little to no reason; they cannot understand you, or you them, and they demand things or time or energy from you. Ultimately, all human relations are fragile, impermanent, and even dangerous

Not too long ago I and my family were broke and close to homeless.  We went to food pantries in the area, which were all at churches, and we got lots of free food at all of them.

Some of them asked us if we were on government programs like SNAP (food stamps) or Medicaid (basically to determine if we were really poor), but some didn't ask us anything at all.  They didn't preach at us or try to convert us.  They just gave us food (and some even had other products they gave out for free, like diapers and toiletries).

They basically saved our lives or at least kept us from starving.

If you go to a Sikh temple they will feed you for free.  Also no questions asked and no preaching.

I'm also reminded of a Radiolab program I heard about the [Carnegie Hero Award](https://www.carnegiehero.org/), and one story in particular from that episode where a man who was waiting at a subway stop with his kids saw a man had fallen in to the tracks.  He immediately jumped down to help him and when he saw there was no more time before the train hit them, instead of saving himself by jumping back on to the platform he lied down on top of the other man to shield him from the train.  Amazingly, they both survived as the train passed over them.

Just one impressive example of someone risking their life to save another.  But there are countless more.  Some like this person do so in the spur of the moment.  Others dedicate their entire lives to helping others at great risk to themselves.  Yet others help in less dramatic ways, often for free or even at their own expense.

That's not to say that there aren't people in the world who do horrible things.  There certainly are.  But viewing the entire human race as malignant is a seriously distorted view of humanity.</div>

huh? people are not in survival mode. you are a coddled humans with human rights, a army who will protect them against slavers or people who exploit them, and have a roof over their head and food on their plate. people are not some survival tribesman in the wilderness, fighting against nature to live

&gt;  
 People are being told that the only way to success, wealth and security is through exploiting other people.

huh? people are told lots of stuff, but that doesnt mean they are stupid enough to believe it. i can tell people im a teleporting space crab, but does that mean they are stupid enough to believe it?  
people act morally bad because they are trash greedy selfish virtue signalling hypocrites. stop trying to sugar coat people's behavior and pretend its anything other than that

&gt;  
 Those who disagree will not be successful.

yeah sure, but thats just playing on how greedy and selfish people are. if they could they'd sell their children into slavery for a mercedes

 The problem with AI is that if they are controlled by corporations,

for a limited time, sure. but over enough time, i dont think anybody controls asi</div>

I don't think that'll work out. We already have very capable models that you can run locally, and we have a ton of competition. That means you'll end up with the perfect ad filter right on your PC. One of the benefits of AI systems, after all, is that you have to interact far less with the original source of information and instead can view everything filtered through AI. That's only going to improve going forward.

See how they interact with the computer in StarTrek:TNG, that's the future of AI (and in large parts already possible today). Any attempt to enshittify a service will just be filtered away by your AI, and you'll just be dealing with raw information. The ad filled world we have today is a result of removing control from the user, AI is giving a lot of that control back into the user's hand.

On phones, it's a bit more problematic, since Apple and Google control everything that happens on there. You'll have to hope for EU to open that up.</div>
