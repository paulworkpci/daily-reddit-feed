I can push through and get uncomfortable with deadlifts, front squats and even bench. But back squat - ughhhhh.

My 1 rep is about 130% body weight, meanwhile most of my friends that are at my same level are way closer to 150+% (our other lifts are very similar).

As soon a backsquat gets uncomfortable (we'll say usually starts at 110%), I just start to get in the 'not today' mindset, nearly every single back squat day. It really bums me out!

Curious if there's ...</div>

On June 8, 1967, during the Six-Day War, Israeli air and naval forces attacked the USS Liberty, a US Navy intelligence ship, in international waters, killing 34 US servicemen and wounding 171. Israel claimed it was a mistaken identity, believing the ship was Egyptian, though this remains controversial. This is a clear case of direct Israeli military action causing US troop deaths.

Over the past six decades, from 1965 to 2025, there are no documented cases where regular Iranian military forces, such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or the Iranian Army, directly caused the deaths of US troops.</div>

It was impressive when they "only" had an image generator, but now having midjourney video on top of their existing image models...  
They have to outsource quite a lot of tasks, but only having 11 full time staff seems nonsensical.</div>

David holz hates VC funding because of his past, but he can absolutely dictate the terms here. An year more of this, Midjourney will be like stability AI, completely forgotten. The field is moving at breakneck speed.</div>

     AI commonly gives you the universal answer that is most readable to others. I don't use it because I prefer my unique and more condensed code with comments on the side of a line that's confusing. If someone wants to understand my code, they got AI to explain it for them and a way to email me. I rather strengthen their brains understanding my code than to waste time on readability. Most importantly, I won't feel guilty when my team project falls apart. My values I'm not willing to compromise. I want my code to be hard to change because I spent so long making it the best in the long-term.</div>

Shockingly, that [caused some backlash](https://fortune.com/2025/05/24/duolingo-ai-first-employees-ceo-luis-von-ahn/). I mean, who could have guessed that writing humans out of the loop in a human-communication language app would make people angry?

Unfortunately, what this means in the short term is that CEO's and business bros are paying lip-service to their own employees while still working to replace 90% of them and lay everyone off.</div>

In the short run popular wisdom suggests the better-paying artisan trades - electrician, plumber, welder, etc. If there's a flood to such work, prices and thus wages will drop. In the long run I believe little is "safe." Perhaps new careers for humans will rise, but it's hard to see from here what they might be (hence the "Singularity" :-) ).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Any job that involves repairing supporting computer hardware and or software.  

Any job that you can see being critical to the function of robotics (From conception to design, support, installing machinery, general maintenance, (hydraulic equipment repair, installation, maintenance) 

Careers in electronics, machine shop work, or any other job that you can think of to install maintain and upgrade robotics and computer-based systems. 

Programmers particularly programmers who understand deep learning and other AI platforms, architecture and multi-level relational databases and database management.  Programmers are almost always required during the planning phase of any AI project.

Systems architects, Network architects and engineers are going to be a critical part of all AI systems.  And also generally very well paid jobs.

Been mine that all of AI is really designed to make people's lives easier however it does not mean it does not require a great deal of human intervention to get up and running and to maintain and keep running. 

For people working in more Hands-On or blue collar operations there will be more than enough work keep people busy and working for the next century towards more functional applications.  HVAC workers construction workers electricians, fire prevention like installing halon in server rooms metal workers who will construct the massive server rooms that will be used for cloud-based AI not to mention all of the infrastructure like network cabling security jobs both computer and physical security that is and many other jobs.

How many different books could be written with the English vocabulary?  Probably a lot more than 10^28.

Anyways, we’ve known that LLMs (transformers, both encoders and decoders) can learn higher order structure of discrete sequences.  Look at the Chinese character separation problem.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Being a stochastic parrot does not mean that it has to memorize a lookup table of “state of the board” -&gt; “best next move”. It compresses the data and “parrots” the patterns, which is much more feasible with a smaller number of weights instead of memorizing the states. No one is saying that LLMs are a bunch of if-else statements, but they are still learning and reapplying the statistical patterns of the game. Whether LLMs being stochastic parrots means that they are not intelligent is not up to me to decide though.</div>

Or those of us who actually understand what they do. Output prediction does not really require a word model in any sense. It takes a pretty motivated reasoning to assume the Othello thing makes it the most likely case.</div>

I'm a professional programmer. C#, Typescript, and Javascript, are no problem, but I've used them all extensively for decades (without AI).

If you want to learn the language, you're going to have to force yourself to code in it for a while, without AI. Otherwise you won't learn it. It's like trying to learn a foreign language without immersion. You won't get fluent without immersion.

Going forward, I'm not sure how important knowing the details of coding is going to be. Understanding application design and patterns and algorithms is really where people will need to focus, and that's a good thing. That's where all the interesting stuff is happening anyway... Typing just gets in the way and slows you down.</div>

That said, over reliance isn’t great honestly if you want to create anything scalable.

Well, guess what - no one is born being amazing at stuff.  Sure there is some difference in genetic ability but most of the reason people are good at something is due to them doing it.  They start out bad at it, and then over time get bett...</div>

But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”

Once you get 'good at something' then you *do* want to actually deliberately practice to get better by identifying weaknesses and working on them, and by keeping your practice at the edge of your comfort zone.  That's how you get *great* at something.</div>

If I'm consistent with my practice I'm generally unphased by the majority of modern life stressors. Also find great joy in metta practice so generating positive emotion is a well honed skill.

But the thing that periodically bugs me is the sense that I'm wasting away my (conventional) life. It feels like I spent a good chunk of my time attempting to wave away that concern by making it all oh so ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes, I've dealt with those sorts of things. I was in a similar situation working in office IT two decades ago. I did lots of things to try to find a better life and did, for a while, but I ended up back in office IT. Nothing about my standard of living is better than it was. My best years are far behind me. The world is in much worse shape. So, the benefits of meditation in regulating my mood and outlook have become more like a necessity now.

The thing is, as frustrating as these circumstances are, I accept them in a way I couldn't when I was younger. I am happier and I am more grateful for simple joys that come and go. I think along the way I came to appreciate just how lost and miserable most people are, and how dire many people's circumstances are, even if they're privileged. That made me feel that the sense of being trapped I still carried with me had to be confronted, mourned and accepted. Someone else here mentioned dukkha. That is the thing. That is very much what you're dealing with and further insight through meditation is probably the best way to deal with it. I certainly haven't found a better way, and I've tried a lot of ways!</div>

   This title to my reply flooded in on its own. I'm not even sure how to flesh it out. It sounds like you have some deficits(social/dating) in your life that are affecting your happiness, and those deficits warp the view of your job. This creates an overall view of "life bad" and meditation becomes a way of distracting yourself from that false belief of "life bad". 

Perhaps it is time to reframe your situation. Be thankful for a job, any job that is not overtly harmful to anyone, and work it with the emotional detachment you know from meditation, knowing that meanwhile it affords you a relatively comfortable living, at least compared to living in a tent on the streets. 

You will get far more insights when your financial needs are met than you would if you were in fight or flight mode struggling to find food on the street.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I've asked chatgpt to stop offering to draft me things after every response within a chat, and then it apologizes and continues to do it anyway. 

Even more annoying is when Gemini replies with the code associated with its response and then I question why it did that, and then its next response refers to me as if it's having a conversation with someone else and completely misses the point. Here's an example: 

&gt;Rethinking my previous thought, I realize I misinterpreted the prompt. The user said "I heard that it was softening" without explicitly stating that I should search for it. My previous thought was that I had already performed the search, but in fact I had not. I need to make the search call now.I am checking for information on this and will provide an update shortly.

Also funny how it says it's checking for something and will provide an update, and then just completely stops at that point because it's waiting for a prompt.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Sharpening my bow and arrow skills… they’ll never catch my scent. I’ve been dry fasting for mental clarity, sunning my taint for hormonal alignment, and hunting surveillance drones using only breathwork and ancestral muscle memory.

I don’t use rangefinders anymore — I ask the spirits. They speak through shifts in wind pressure and goosebumps. And when they whisper *“draw,”* I don’t think. I *release.*

This isn’t about violence. It’s about alignment. Precision. Discipline. The bow doesn’t kill — it reveals.</div>
