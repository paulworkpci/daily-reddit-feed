This list almost certainly has a large number of politicians in both parties, Trump included, along with social/cultural figures. It's been a mutually assured destruction pact between both administrations to not release any names. It'd be stupid for them to. The real question is WHY were they being blackmailed? If any part of this list comes out it'll be literally a political nuclear bomb.</div>

All these investments to make China a STEM powerhouse are a key element of Xi’s national policy. These have been long term investments for 20+ years now</div>

America doesn't culturally reinforce STEM achievement nearly as much as it does more vapid shit like YouTuber, influencer, singer, actor, athlete ect.  Not that there's a problem with those things inherently (a bit though).  But the nation that claims the STEM crown will be the superpower of the future in this AI race.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Because their government defined AI Research as a core pillar of their "new generation ai development plan for 2030" strategy, which they adopted back in 2017.

This wasn't like the company-level strategies you see in the west. It came directly from the policy makers themselves. We're seeing the results now. 7 years after that policy, with a load of new PHDs around AI/ML = most research in the space is Chinese.

I actually work alongside a PhD Data Scientist from China and he said - back home - the attitude towards progress is completely different. There is no protectionism ( think OpenAI hiding reasoning models for months ) as everyone is working to a common goal. If university A makes a breakthrough, they share it, and collaborate wherever possible to facilitate the national strategy.

Edit - Since this sparked a bit of debate, a prime example is Tsinghua University. I asked my Chinese colleague why their research is SO good and he said it's because research is seen as noble and honourable in China. Publishing weak or sensationalist research (even preprint) is seen as very undesirable. Xi jingping went to that University and NOBODY dare be the person to disgrace his reputation in any way. For context, the acceptance rate at my university (2nd best in world at the time) was around 30%, and the acceptance rate at Tsinghua university is around 0.3% in a country where getting anything less than perfect grades is seen as failure...</div>

It's every bit as good as our codebases, but to speak directly to your point, it's both because of and in spite of the CCP. In America, you guard your code with your life and hope to sell it to a MegaCorp or to get anointed by an "Angel Investor".  Across the 'big pond', if you make it big, the CCP comes knocking. Go ask Jack Ma. So what is one to do?

You utilize the enormous tech investments and technology centers to build your systems, then you open source everything and *license* it for commercial use. That way the CCP can't take it!! It really, really works well actually and creates the most fun culture of sharing and rapid advancement that I've ever been part of; and I've been banging on code since the early 90s.</div>

There's positives and negatives, I work with a lot of people from Asian countries that have a similar educational culture and while they're technically very competent I find they're more comfortable following orders than taking the initiative with things. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don't know US, but Europe committed suicide soon after 2008, when they decided to cut research money and give them to big projects they deemed "safe". It was an utterly failure that pushed out most theoretical and computational researchers out of their institutions, by treating them like not valuable, giving no job security and left fighting in an artificial, sadistic rat race.


Now we are creating values for the shareholders doing "practical" AI in industry, we have job security, and above the average salaries, but Europe has lost 2 generations of researchers and is now too much behind.


A shame. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Jake the Rizzbot is a Unitree G1 humanoid robot spotted around Austin, Texas, in public spaces like The Domain and downtown. It’s remote-controlled, not autonomous, and equipped with LIDAR and depth cameras for mobility. The bot wears a cowboy hat, silver chain, and sneakers, and speaks in Gen Z slang as part of a public-facing demo. It’s labeled “IN TRAINING” and appears to be a street test blending robotics with social interaction. It is. Ring remote controlled. In Detroit there is one advertising for a robot fight league 

Detroit resident spotted a full-size humanoid robot named Zion strolling down 7 Mile Road, stopping to shake hands and greeting pedestrians. The walk was part of a promotional demo for the upcoming RoboWar event on July 19, hosted by Interactive Combat League. Art Cartwright, the event organizer, emphasized that Zion is “harmless” and serves to familiarize the public with robotics and spark youth interest in STEM. Witnesses described the movement as “beautiful” and likened it to RoboCop. The appearance quickly went viral across social media and local news</div>

Edit: asking because I’m on this journey or at least starting this journey right now. I listen to music w binaural beats in the background—helps me w longer deeper meditations

                        <div class="comment-body">I do exactly as in your title. Started from a few minutes 10 years ago. Close to 1000 days streak.

Benefits are all encompassing. Many are internal and personal understandings of life. Others are mundane and day-to-day beneficial:

+ anxiety dropped tenfold
+ much easier to quit harmful habits
+ joy or neutral feelings during any activity, including most “boring” one
+ creativity skyrockets, I literally solodeved a computer game on year 39 of my life
+ super stable sleep
+ many small ones that are just a part of me now and mike  human experience better all around

It’s all gradual. First years not that obvious: I quit then returned several times.

Better paired with moral conduct for higher effectiveness. One can apply any established and proven system (Stoicism, Christianity, Buddhism, etc). I’ve heard and seen many transformative stories which included this key step.

Have a wonderful journey 😊</div>

so it won't benefit

Jesus loves us that's why he died for us

how can you do it

rejecting love

accept him

repent

                        <div class="comment-body">I meditate for an hour daily. It takes me about 20 minutes to really settle in, quiet the mind, and begin to feel like I'm meditating. It definitely takes working up to, especially if you're sitting on the floor with a cushion, as your back muscles will also need to adjust to longer sit lengths.

In daily life, I feel more grounded, calm, less reactive, less lost in worries and anxiety spirals in my mind. While meditating shorter helps, I think 45 minutes or more is really the sweet spot, which is why I see it mentioned as the goal in a lot of places—eg, TMI, MIDL—whether it's one or two sits per day.</div>

How bad is it?

I did a back of the envelope calculation before and then I saw Opus pricing...

[Full post and all numbers and graphs here.](https://blaustrom.substack.com/p/can-ai-code-assistants-be-unlimited)

I am making a guess that that was the trigger. Opus 4. But it could also mean that they were making too little overall.

                        <div class="comment-body">Cursor was always doomed as their primary business is reselling API credits. They're trying to position themselves as a purveyor of premium software, which, I guess is the only path they have forward, but I don't see it working very well. There are plenty of bring-your-own-key solutions that work just as well. 

As for the others they either own or have a large stake in the primary product itself, I don't think they're losing much on these subscriptions. I'd say we'll probably see more enshittification in the near term then things will get cheaper and more consumer friendly as LLM operating costs go down.</div>

I know that universities are “supposed” to be about “education” rather than helping their students get employed and financially secure. However, with how much they charge in the United States, they need to be doing much more to ensure a high ROI. </div>

This is thanks to guaranteed student loans by the government.  This has allowed universities to hire an insane number of worthless administrators.  We need to get rid of student loans ASAP and just let some of these colleges go bankrupt/trim the fat at other colleges.  It's the most insanely stupid form of welfare I've ever seen, we're putting kids into insane debt for poor jobs prospects so a bunch of useless people can get sinecures at universities.</div>

AI isn't ruining universities. Universities have been ruined for some time. 

Professors have been reluctant to fail students because costs have gone up so much. That means that students arent held accountable and teachers have gotten lazy.

Now add AI to the mix and its even easier to get lazy in college. By the time graduates enter the job market, they realize they learned nothing except how to Google/ChatGPT answers. I cannot tell you how many of my students DEMANDED an A just because they showed up to class and did what was asked. I used to say "doing the expectation is a C. Exceeding the expectation is a B. Excellence is an A." None of my students understood that. Grade inflation is a real thing.

Both student and professor are responsible for all of this. AI isn't responsible for any of it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">University-for-all was a very deliberate Thatcherite &amp; Blairite policy in the UK:   
(a) to reduce official unemployment figures by taking 18-21 year olds off the books,   
and   
(b) as part of the anti-labour &amp; anti-union pivot - away from an extractive &amp; manufacturing economy towards a knowledge &amp; services economy.  
Later:  
(c) as student loans were phased in, they became a not insignificant part of increasing the money supply\*, with an outstanding balance of over a quarter of a TRILLION quid.. 

All those politico-economic motivators have remained in place for subsequent govts so don't expect the policy to go away any time soon!

Anecdotal, sure, but I doubt my experience is unique. There are also quite a few EVs. Zero of those owners want a Dodge.

  
I've also never seen a Hornet on the road. I'm sure they are out there, but I just never see them. I honestly forgot they existed until I went to Dodge's website just now because I completely forgot what else they were still making.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">China is adding green power capacity at a rate of 5 nuclear power plants per week, with usable energy output of one nuclear power plant per week.

Its equivalent of USA building 208 nuclear powerplants during Trumps rule.

USA currently has 54 nuclear poweplants with 93 reactors, from the beggining of nuclear time.

So in 4 years China will more than double whatever USA built since 1945. If they figure out storage in this 4 years, multiply everything by 5, it will be around 1000 times.

And its much cheaper, faster to build and more benevolent than anything nuclear, coal or oil/gas b1ased.

At one point bullshit exposes itself as clear bullshit.

If they don't figure out a way, maybe some mostly minority neighborhoods experience more blackouts. As we've seen so many times in the past, most large corporations consider that sort of thing to be a completely unacceptable outcome and will sacrifice profits to avoid it if that's what's necessary.

Does that sound about right?</div>

Then I signed up for a pottery class.

Not because I was good at it. Not even because I liked pottery. I just figured: worst case, I waste two hours a week making ugly bowls. Best case? I talk to someone.

                        <div class="comment-body">When I was younger, I was prepping for a trip to Italy so I enrolled in a language course. The students consisted of one young woman who had majored in Italian in college, brothers who were nearly fluent in Spanish (a cousin-language) and me with no connection whatsoever. The teacher would ask a question in Italian and the woman would answer, then he'd ask the brothers the same question, then he'd ask me in English, "Do you want to try?" But you know what, it was FUN and such a relief to not have to be good at something like I had to be good at work or in my other activities. Who cared if I was bad at Italian? I was better than I would have been without the lessons. And we'd all go out after and drink and it was a blast. This is solid advice.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That reminds me of my Erasmus exchange semester in Rome. The big universities like Sapienza had around 200 Erasmus students, so the Germans would gravitate towards the other Germans, the French to the French, and they’d just speak their native language. I was assigned to a very small university with just 12 Erasmus students. Two from Germany, three from Spain, one from Belgium—you get the picture. Literally the only language we all had in common was our broken Italian, and we all got so much better so quickly, I’m really glad it worked out that way.</div>

Windsurf was supposed to be acquired by OpenAI for $3B and then got strip mined by google for $ 2.4B. Cursor is currently valued at $10B. Both of them are basically VS Code fork with some extra prompts. I used them both and found absolutely nothing special. Claude Code was just so much superior. What do people find so useful about these wrappers? I am genuinely curious.</div>

The tools are fully commoditized now: Search via grep, view/modify files, etc (full list: [https://docs.cursor.com/agent/tools](https://docs.cursor.com/agent/tools) ). Same stuff as Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, etc. They do have a vector search tool but Cursor doesn't even use it much (not sure about WS).

The choices that they make are small configurations like the default number of lines to pass in a view file call. It's really banal.

They are valuable because people use them. People use them because they have made good product decisions up to now. They have no IP moat. Sometimes wrappers remain valuable but not usually when the LLM provider chooses to do the thing too.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Windsurf actually seemed undervalued given how hyped up it was. 

That said, IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf definitely boosts developer productivity even if we don't end up developing some independent coding agent in the next 10 years. I don't think they're overvalued compared to other AI startups. 

Plus, the well-known companies usually have pretty similar products under the hood. Facebook is a social media app and there were tons of social media apps before it. Google's front page is a search box that hasn't changed in 20 years (though their underlying algorithm is complex). 

I think people need to stop dismissing every startup as a LLM wrapper (even though a lot are). That would be like calling every SaaS product a SQL wrapper, which is true if you look it at a very basic level, but that doesn't mean these companies have value. 

That said, yes Claude Code will probably hurt Cursor and Windsurf significantly (and it already has).</div>

The barrier to entry is fairly low if you already understand LLMs at a fundamental level and have hundreds of millions of users (like OpenAI do).

I'd argue it was never an essential purchase for OpenAI.</div>

System prompts are like a weak and bad bandage to try and cure a massive wound (bad analogy my fault but you get it).

I understand there were many delays so they couldn’t push the promised date any further but there has to be some type of regulation that forces them not to release models that are behaving like this because you didn’t care enough for the data you trained it on or didn’t manage to fix it in time...</div>

When it replies with something factually true and he loses his mind about how it's a "woke AI" and changes it until it's doing what he wants. And therefore, MechaHitler.</div>
