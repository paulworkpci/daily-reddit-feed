                        <div class="comment-body">OK boys, as the video descriptions says ''this is a Boeing 747 Airbridge cargo jet travelling at 37000 feet en route from Cincinnati (CVG) USA to Leipzip (LEJ) Germany''. The camera used is a Nikon P1000 and from my search the price is about 1k USD. 
I have no idea how far the guy is but using Pythagoras the plane should be at least a few more km away than 11. Not my vid, just something that popped up on my YT.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Optical lens zoom makes all the difference. P1000 was a legend for having a 125x zoom lens, it was built exactly for super zoom, no one had ever released anything like it. It's no longer made, but there is a P1100 now that might see night time lights better.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Okay so here we have 747 which is 232 feet long and has a wing span of 200 feet. One of the biggest UAP, the tictac is 55 feet long and 30-45 feet wide. Is completely white without any markings or discernible features.  
If you look at this video of the plane, the visibility is perfect, travelling in a straight line with low speed and basicly every smooth surface looks transparent. Does whipping out facts on the table start making sense about what we are discussing here?  
  
Edit: you guys really fell for that "counter argument"... where exactly is skywatch claiming they have footage of a football field sized UAP? Where is ANY footage of a football field sized UAP? This post is a direct attack on the delivered footage by skywatchers, that is the focus, nobody is talking about phoenix lights or kremlin pyramid... that isn't relevant to this post.</div>

I've uninstalled all music apps, YouTube, any social media, and discord. Really anything besides a browser I can't use. I've had serious withdrawals but I held strong and I plan to keep going for 3 weeks to hopefully to be, better able to manage my time, as well stop using YouTube as a distraction.
Here's my experience so far.

&gt;It's a bug on the OpenRouter end. The actual average speed is way slower than it seems. The API just outputs a lot as the first token after the thinking phase. Since we don't have access to the 'thinking' part through the API, weird stuff happens. Google were having some issues on Friday, you can see it in the Uptime logs, so they probably did something that causes the initial output to be larger, but overall it's actually slower. Try testing it in the chat on OpenRouter, and you'll see what I mean.</div>

Like even putting aside Gemini / deepmind for a sec, Google’s cloud and in house chip are competitive with Nvidia in terms of performance (**proven**, via SSI Anthropic and of course Gemini 2.5pro SOTA all using them) while being way cheaper. 

GCP is clearly set to dominate cloud AI compute due to this. Their profit margins are also going to be insane since cost of goods is so much cheaper</div>

Llama had its chance to step, but it was a failure.

Meanwhile, Google keep raising the bar to a level considered insane. While Open AI/Chat GPT is infamously just trying to keep its image of cutting edge while cheaper but roughtly as effective rivals surge and Gemini takes the cutting edge aspect while being also more cost-effective than them.</div>

It’s instantly evident how savvy and knowledgeable they are in politics compared to the alternative media crew like Tim Pool, Joe Rogan or Dave Smith. They know the system inside out and make these other podcasters look what they are, basically uninformed amateurs.</div>

I've realized that a lot of doomscrolling is not always avoidance, but sometimes I just want to browse and explore ideas and see what's sparking the dopamine for a given time. It's like a creative consumption mode. I've found that browsing pinterest and the library help.

Anyone noticed this browsing mode? What are your exploring/browsing activities that aren't doomscrolling?</div>

My replies are things like "oh I like roller skating and reading!" I don't read very often and I only roller skate like once every three months. However, I also understand that they are kinda asking you "what things do you like, that the other people around probably don't?" I figure that a person would only ask you the original question in order to learn more about you, to distinguish you from others in the future.</div>

OpenAI hasn't been "entirely through a non-profit" for a very long time. The specific contention is that the for-profit entity will now essentially have full control.</div>

Like how they scraped all of the data from the internet to train their Ai on, but said "hey, we're nonprofit, so pay no attention to it (even if our users are using it for profit), then once they have what they wanted, OpenAi wants to now be for profit and start doing large business deals with other companies and charging large prices.

It simply isn’t able to pull in enough context of the existing codebase or company operations to create anything particularly useful.

It’s an incredible tool for “coding in the small” though.  We cherish our autocomplete, and right now AI is sort of like autocomplete on steroids.  It’s a profound change in the way we code, even if it doesn’t live up to a fraction of the expectations so many of us have of AI in general.</div>

However, something I learnt quite quickly after leaving cs at school and doing programming in the real world is, most of the programming happens long before you open your IDE and start coding. When I'm talking to stakeholders who don't even fully know what their requirements are, I have to leverage company and industry knowledge to dream up a tool or pipeline that will solve their real problem (instead of the problem they think they have). I think we're still a while away from stakeholders being able to go straight from "description of problem" -&gt; "programmed and deployed solution". But I can see these sorts of tools massively changing how I work and produce code, if not fully replacing me just yet.</div>

I love the little details, like the differently colored cubes, the decision to go for a nicer-looking circular cake over a plain cube when the prompt was a minecraft cake, the little darker coffee fines in the coffee.. You know what they mean? This thing has aestheticism baked into it, it doesn't just pass it wants to pass with flying colors, that is really good.

I think my favorite by far is the fifth one, extremely hard prompt but it did a great job.

Anyway, good spatial reasoning and long term planning will translate well into many other applications. Can't wait for the next 5 months.</div>

First of all, it has a very straightforward XML file format for storing ship data, so it might be easier to work with for LLMs

Second, it will be easy to set up objective metrics for the design - "ship must have enough thrust to land on Earth", "ship must be able to take off into space", "ship must have a jump range of 6000 Km", "ship must have those functional blocks", "ship must have guided missiles", "ship must be able to land automatically", "ship must be able to hover in 1g gravity for an hour"; "design a 4-seater car that relies on battery power", "design a mobile base with articulated suspension".

Third, there are a lot of logistical problems, like installing enough fuel tanks, power sources, thrusters with different amounts in different directions, and also automation blocks (SE's better alternative to redstone).

Fourth, there is also a huge knowledge base in terms of Steam Workshop that models can be trained on.

And in the end the builds can be rated on both objective criteria (functionality) and subjective (style).</div>

New Jersey Drones-   
  
Here are a couple videos I can share taken on our personal phones back in December of objects showing up in and around the airspace over Picatinny Arsenal.    
  
A couple of reasons for alarm, or at least to take an interest:  
  
1. In first video you will see objects appear to materialize and dematerialize and then hover with no FAA lighting systems.    
  
2. Watch second video (scope shadow) until the end.  You will see regular aircraft fly by in the background for reference of what FAA approved traffic in the area should look like.   
  
3. All of the suspicious objects are operating in violation of FAA regulations and were not being controlled by ATC.  They have no red and green navigation lights, no strobe, are operating at unauthorized altitudes, and in restricted air space.

                        <div class="comment-body">Actually, early March, I've personally spent a week observing the actual skies there, and on every single day the weather allowed for enough visibility, I was able to spot dozens of UAP that *were* blinking with FAA lighting-like patterns, however, they would randomly change. New lights going online, others going offline or changing patterns, changing colors ... and also flying super low, slow and near silent. Looking like regular commercial airtraffic from afar when captured on regular consumer smartphones, but lacking clear markings/texture/details, more of a uniform gray/black body. So in person with your own eyes, when they fly over close, it's super easy and obvious to tell these are not 757's or other similar craft.

Just a few days ago I heard back from a local there that they still show up. So I can only assume its still showing up *daily*. Go to the Walmart parking of Netcong, not even 10 miles from Picatinny, within half an hour after sunset, the first ones show up. And of course, be ready to have ADS-B open to separate the identified lights from the as of yet remaining unidentified ones.

On my last two days there I saw additional UAP activity that were far beyond traditional navigation lights or other air craft like behavior.

*edit, sorry wrong link, meant this one*

https://www.reddit.com/r/NJDrones/s/sdmbwaVJH1

Skywatcher should be monitoring the skies there, preferably with a good professional thermal camera to get easy definite proof of all these New Jersey "drones" not being drones at all. A clear thermal signature capture of these unidentified flying objects (UFO...) should quickly settle the score of them being "just planes bro" because if so, then the engines will show up as clear hot spots on the body. I however suspect we'll get a completely even distribution, which would rule out any man made tech. So let's go get the actual data please!

They seem to own or able to operate 2 helicopters, surely this should be an easy task for them to carry out?</div>

I am highly skeptical but it seems very fair that some of thes ufo folks visit NJ and have a look. Not sure why Ross, Lue, Jake etc are sitting on their hands for this one.

You have seen them and judge them as not being planes so I would wish some US based folks would go there with equipment. Have you had luck contacting some local ufo groups ?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Campbell's at Glencoe were pretty despicable.

Edit for reference: "The Glencoe Massacre (1692) was a brutal episode in Scottish history where government soldiers many from Clan Campbell, under orders from King William III, killed 38 members of Clan MacDonald of Glencoe. The MacDonalds had delayed swearing allegiance to the king after the Glorious Revolution, and this was used as a pretext for punishment. The most infamous part was that the Campbell soldiers had been living as guests among the MacDonalds for nearly two weeks, sharing food and shelter, before turning on them in the early morning hours. It wasn’t just a massacre—it was a betrayal, seen as a chilling example of state-sanctioned violence and clan politics. The event left a lasting scar and symbolized the deep mistrust between Highland clans and the central government."</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Corfitz Ulfeldt is not well known outside of Scandinavia, but very bad.

In a quick recap he was in a top position under the Danish king in the mid 1600's, but did a bunch a corrupt stuff (allegedly) and fled to Sweden who had been the mortal enemies of Denmark for hundreds of years.

Here he started working for the Swedish king and didn't just tell him every Danish secret he knew, but  deliberate did everything he could to enrage the swedes against the Danes, so they would declare them war.

After a few years he succeeded and he didn't just help the Swedish tropes from the front lines (again with a bunch of important information about the Danish army and the landscape), he also let the Swedish king borrow insane amounts of money from him that he had stolen from the Danish treasury. Money that was then used to buy mercenaries for the invasion. 

The swedes won and Ulfeldt got his own lands back and even a Danish island for his troubles. But it wasn't long before the Swedish king also started being annoyed with Ulfeldt who now fled back to Denmark where he was arrested. 

For some insane reason he was eventually allowed to leave the country because he said he needed to go to a spa for his health. Of course he didn't go to a spa and fled Denmark once again. This time he went to a bunch of different kings in Europe and tried to get them in on his crazy schemes essentially. He also gave the skull of one of the biggest Danish saints to the French, another thing he had stolen. 

He even tried to arrange a coup of the Danish throne, but without luck. The Danes never got him again, but his wife was famously imprisoned in a tower for 22 years, essentially in her husband's place. 

Ulfeldt was so hated in Denmark that a "statue of shame" was erected for him, that people were supposed to spit on as they walked past. It stood in Copenhagen for hundreds of years.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I remember that in 2023, he said we would have AGI by September 2024, AGI that would work by "any way you define AGI." He claimed that no matter how you define it, it would meet that criteria. I do agree with him that others have moved the goalposts for what AGI is, but I also think he moved them too just in the opposite direction. He shifted the definition backward to make it seem like he predicted something accurately, which he did not.</div>

Had what we have today come out 10 years ago there would be damn near unanimous consent that we had AGI at that point, but since it didn't then every step of the way everyone has been saying, "Wait, this could definitely be better." - and it could, every single time, which is pretty damn awesome. But we have still passed multiple goalposts on this that in the past would have been an absolute victory.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is the problem with the vast majority of people who have strong opinions on when we'll have AGI.

They don't actually present a specific and objectively measurable criteria for what they consider to be AGI -- so they're always free to say "I was right!" quite simply by retroactively adjusting the definition so as to fit whatever we happen to have at the date they predicted.

None of them have a: "Something is AGI if it can pass \*this\* specific test!" kinda definition.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A capitalistic case study would point you to **Jevons Paradox**—the observation that increases in efficiency often lead to *higher* overall consumption, not less. We see this playing out with AI development.

Even in the best-case scenario for OpenAI, what we're looking at is a high-tier subscription and maybe an agentic frontend. But it’s not truly autonomous. There’s no accountability, no guarantees. There will always be humans in the loop—delegating work, conversing with the agent, and course-correcting its output.

Right now, even the best agents can only run for about 5 minutes before they start breaking things, and within 20–30 minutes, they often degrade the project into unrecoverable garbage. That *will* improve—but we're still far from fully autonomous systems. Realistically, we’ll likely find an optimal **human-to-AI developer ratio**, not a full replacement.

But going back to Jevons Paradox: suppose you used to have 10 human devs, and now you have 8 humans and 2 AI agents for the same cost. The team is suddenly 4x more efficient. That efficiency lowers the cost of software, which increases demand, which drives more investment in software—and that creates even more teams with the 8:2 human-AI structure.

The more efficient we get, the more demand we generate. It’s a feedback loop we’ve seen many times before. AI won’t eliminate jobs wholesale—it’ll reshape them, and in doing so, expand the total scope of software work.</div>

They sprint toward productivity… then crash.

Japanese teachings taught me this about slowing down to actually move faster.

Kaizen - “Continuous Improvement”

Instead of overhauling my entire life, I focused on small, daily gains:
1% better at French every day.
1 more rep in the gym.
1 cleaner system to manage my week.
Kaizen helped me sustain progress without burning out.

Shinrin-yoku - “Forest Bathing”

Nature isn’t a luxury. It’s medicine.

As someone who lived in Japan. Studied Japanese, and married a Japanese national, please do not push these as teachings. These aren't some philosophical things that all Japanese practice and pass on to their children and whatnot. It's western culture distorting that as something more than it really is.

I'm glad you found purpose in it but you need to know the truth behind those "teachings".</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I can’t let go of the idea that dreams aren’t just brain noise, they’re us tuning into parallel versions of ourselves in alternate timelines. Like, every time we sleep, our consciousness slips the main frequency and syncs with another version of reality. That’s why sometimes dreams feel too real, or you wake up feeling like you lived a whole life in a place you've never seen.

Déjà vu? Just a crossover glitch. 
Nightmares? Maybe you landed in a timeline where you made different choices. 
Lucid dreaming? That’s you waking up inside your alt-life.

It sounds nuts… but deep down, doesn’t it kinda track?

Fun to think about if nothing else</div>

I don't feel comfortable consuming like I used to, checking the ingredients list for unhealthy &amp; healthy ingredients doesn't even matter anymore, there's something you should stay away from in everything now.

It feels like we're at a point where we're just picking one unhealthy thing over another.

We shouldn't have to pick our poison.</div>
