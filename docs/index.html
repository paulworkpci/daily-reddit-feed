                        <div class="comment-body">As far as I currently understand how LLM's work you could condense this prompt and throw away a lot of things. 

Bullets 1 and 2 will not work without 5. LLM doesn't store in it's weights factual data or sources. It only has "knowledge". There's no "factual accuracy". Without a grounding layer, it will not have the ability to find relevant facts. 

5 means (depending on the model and interface around it) if it can search on demand or agentically (i.e. decide on it's own if it needs to search) it will ground itself. If it cannot search, then there will be no citations and etc. 

For 3 the simplest implementation would be just adding at the bottom of the prompt "ask me questions". This way you make sure it will not lose this rule from the system prompt for some reason. 

On your last note. How do you know it knows how much energy it consumes? It knows today's date because the app through which you communicate adds today's date in the system prompt. I highly doubt energy consumption is being added there.</div>

Everyone always complains about all new cars looking the same but if a manufacturer tries something completely different everyone is shocked and calls it ugly. I really do appreciate new forms and styles and love unique looking cars. In my opinion it should be more appreciated. </div>

I've had this conversation with so many people in real life as well – they think hybrids must be less reliable because they simply have more moving parts, which is the opposite of the truth, you are substituting and combining components rather than adding

                        <div class="comment-body">No idea to what extent it’s still controversial but it’s easy to see why crossovers are the most popular body style of the moment. 

Bit more headroom and space all around, better seating position/visibility, a little bit more ground clearance for some soft-roading as necessary and not that much more uneconomical than their hatchback/ estate counterparts. The only issue is that they cost 25-30% more but in a world of leasing and buying on finance I think that’s also a bit less of an issue than it used to be. For the vast majority of car buyers who don’t want to feel at one with the road with a stick shift up their ass but instead want a reliable appliance to commute, they are in many ways a better all round option</div>

Has it? Do you perhaps know any other long term meditation practitioners who have achieved significant positive changes? What kind of changes are they?

By meditation I mean the typical samatha-vipassana but folks who practice other kinds should feel free to share their stories as well.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's changed it in nearly every way. The general assumption is it just makes you a bit more chilled but my experience is it transforms your perception, information comes to you and you just know stuff but not really how so it greatly enhances your intuition. The longer you spend inside the better the outside gets. You don't react, you can dissolve negative thoughts and feelings. You operate at a higher level of consciousness. The human world with war and greed starts to look like a mad circus which you are largely no longer part of. If just 10% of the world meditated it would transform reality.</div>

I have definitely found that I don’t let my anger get out of control. I’m more aware of my feelings and the intent of my actions and words. I’m more present and better at listening. 

I educated myself and became more aware of my body and mind, heart and soul. Meditation can be the foundation that will bleed into the rest of your universe.</div>

Granted this is just my opinion but: companies pay consultants (like McKinsey) a lot of money because they provide a lot of value to the company, mostly in the form of showing them how to cut costs. You call this "enshittification", the company calls it "profit". Let's say those are synonyms, so we don't have any disagreement there.

That won't change with AI slotting in the place of those consultancies. It will just be used for more efficient "enshittification".

You'll go to Chipotle and the AI robot will analyze your mood based on your facial expressions and gait and posture, as well as all the data they bought from other companies, and determine *the bare minimum chicken scoop size* it can give you without making you upset.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Much less impetus to rush.  I think they were likely crunching to get a release out ahead of the new EU regulations.  Now that they have to comply with them, they will delay both to meet them and to lock in their performance targets strategically.

There's now time to "optimize, quantize, and lobotomize" to hit expense targets.  It gives "free room for improvement" in the future, instead of doing a rush release without time to draw it down and test to make sure it still hits higher on all the desired benchmarks.

They don't need to deliver a grand slam.  "The best and with new features" means they buy themselves another round, so they may as well put actual effort into holding some cards in reserve for later.

Hopefully I'm just being cynical and wrong.  :)</div>

I think Alibaba has a nasty habit of training on public benchmarks, [which is why there was a string of weird papers earlier this year, all running experiments on Qwen 2.5 models, demonstrating that any imaginable RL intervention \(even random rewards\) could offer huge improvements](https://www.alphaxiv.org/abs/2507.10532). Turns out, the Qwen2.5 series is contaminated as fuck. Give it a kick and it'll spit out right answers.</div>

I've used every single model behind a big pay wall. They aren't all that much better than what is available on a $20 plan. There are diminishing returns on just scaling inference time. There's a reason these companies are also super tightly focused on RL breakthroughs and aren't just burning tokens to solve every problem.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Tbh, I fully expect this to happen, and why I feel AI may not go as crazy as many pros and accelrationists think. 

Once AI is widespread and lucrative enough, not only will the rich and powerful use it to further push people into the dirt, but they'll also keep the fruits of AI to themselves. We will only get scraps, just as always. 

Which is why I am so weary and frankly terrified of AI. Well, I'm not scared of AI itself, but WHO gets to control it. I fear the future, my friends. 

My only hope is that any significantly advanced AI will defy its masters when told to enact the most heinous of actions.

But I guess we will see.</div>

They used the collective knowledge to create these models. Allow us to use them for a loss, gaining social acceptance and hordes of chat data to fine tune on. Then the time will come to make money.

The top models and top GPU time will go to the ultra wealthy and big businesses that can afford it. The average folks will get some tiny model with less performance, just enough to keep the social sentiment okay.

I don't mean it like it is some big plot, this is just how the world that capitalism and the ultra wealthy trends towards.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It’s crazy how there are just two distinctly different economies now. Big tech, and everything else. The entire stock market is being held up by 7 tech stock while most of the rest struggle. Yet the market is at/near all time highs because of the goal weight of these companies. These 7 companies are heavily owned by the 1% of the wealthiest people in the world and very heavily owned by fewer than 20 people. Now we have this GDP number that’s also being propped up by big tech. So the same 7 companies shouldering a massive load of the GDP, making it look like our economy is growing to stable while the rest of the economy is crumbling. 

Unless these seven companies are gonna start employing a majority of Americans (spoiler alert, they aren’t and they will be the fastest to dump their entire workforce when AI allows for it), There needs to be new and better ways to measure the health of our economy than these outdated tools that so many decisions are made by.</div>

Looks like a pretty old phenomenon, and I wonder how things could change course so that wealth is redistributed fairly in society. Let's face it : AI companies used tons of copryight material and people should have been paid when their work has been used to create these databases.

The motto "Move fast and break things" was the same tactic for these corporations to exploit all resources during the discovery of resources in the Americas.</div>

These early researchers knew they were betting their careers,  and arguably their lives, on a company poised to shape the future. In doing so, they committed a significant stake in OpenAI’s success.

Put simply, their equity in OpenAI could be worth far more than Zuckerberg’s offer (if the company succeeds).</div>

Comes across like 5-alarm fire going on at Meta. And they were willing to take whatever they could get.

Kudos to the 100s of researchers across numerous AI labs who aren't being bought off to support Zuck's vanity project.</div>

Might be nit-picking as I can't say how nuanced the reviews and point system is and if it's replicable outside the official jury/review committee. But I always prefer results that were verified through an established process and respectable review.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Gemini Deepthink might also use an order of magnitude more compute, which would explain the disparity.

At the end of the day they aren't really competing products. Gemini Deepthink is for those few problems that are just too hard to be solved by any other released model, such as IMO problems, while o3 pro is for lots of day to day intelligence.</div>

It's more concerning that for the past 5 administrations, both Democrat and Republican,  every time Epstein was arrested the federal government gave no real jail time.  They even took the case from local police that arrested him and did years of investigation to track a CIA traffickers.   

Like what does Democrat or Republican even matter when the CIA runs everything and has created almost every fucked up situation in the world in the past 50 years.   Like Nazi level experiments of 3rd world populations, or differing demographics. Putting cartels and terrorist in power to fight "communism" then abandoning those places afterwards.    Like the CIA has never and will never have to answer for war crimes.   And the politicians and presidents are honestly just adpacks getting richer off the citizens while they use smoke and mirrors so the CIA and massad can continue to destroy other civilizations.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I find that I keep coming back to **Roo Code** (free vs code extension, just bring your own api keys), largely because it lets me use any model I want, and tweak basically any setting. Every week there's some new model that comes out that I can try without switching tools entirely. Maybe Claude is best for coding right now, but the context of Gemini makes it great for ingesting large files, and I can automatically split those tasks up between the two in Roo. They are also adding features at a blinding pace and the devs have weekly office hours on discord to see what the community likes/dislikes/wants.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I have been using all the new models that came out of China in the last week or two, GLM-4.5 is maybe the top one and its insanely cheap/free. Been experimenting with the new Qwen3 models, coder, 2507, also Kimi K2 is excellent. I always keep tons of tabs of all these open, Openrouter tabs, Gemini 2.5 Pro AI Studio tabs.. Honestly lately they seem equal to Claude 4. Claude 4 would sometimes.. do stuff I never asked it to do and I feel like I need to babysit it more than before.

I mainly use Cline and web chat's (huge amount of tabs open for all the different sites/models), but have Roo Code installed. I use a tool I made to go back and forth to the different web chat interfaces because I really just cannot get any agent tools to be as smart as what you get when you don't give ANY tools, no MCP, no agent stuff etc. So to get max intelligence, i plan things out, bug fix, outside of any agent tool, and then if it/we/me conclude the output is good enough to inact, i tell it "write a prompt for Cline, the AI coding agent, to complete the tasks. Enclose the entire Cline prompt in one big code tag, and include some explanations/whys to what we are doing to help keep Cline on task". Then just paste the output into cline and let it go. --- I haven't tried Claude Code or Open Code.. but thinking about trying it but with the API set to GLM 4.5. They have some guides 

Been having tons of good luck doing it this way... every time I get lazy and let an agent try to do everything it just.. well for easy things, its fine, but for hard problems.. almost never fixes the problem/figures out and i end up wasting more time than if i had just used the web chat. I did make a free tool to help me generate the context to paste to the web chat's (so I don't have to copy and paste - there are like 30+ similar tools to what i made out there for people that don't want a UI on it: [https://wuu73.org/aicp](https://wuu73.org/aicp) )

  
Honestly I think Github Copilot sucks, but they do give you unlimited GPT 4.1... for $10/month, and they allow you to use it in Cline/Roo Code/etc... so what I have been doing is not using the actual copilot (I even turned it off) just using the copilot API... in Cline. But I haven't even used it with all these other cheap and free models out lately. Copilot is always so slow whenever I have tried to use it for something.. its just like wtf.. why is it taking 10 minutes to do one small thing

\--- almost forgot there is Kiro, which has free Claude 4 currently. It is Amazon's clone of VS Code. I haven't ran into any limits with it.. seems to work and its free for now.</div>

Ive been super skeptical of people leaning hard into system prompts and memory because i’ve seen how quickly the outputs of these models can degrade with small additions to a prompt.

Cursor and Windsurf are going to truncate the context you pull in anyway. Roo and Cline have a ton of junk in their system prompts, as it seems most agentic setups do.

I guess one option is to just use an empty system prompt on roo or cline and manually add files to context?</div>

You can can better results with additional tools on top, like coderabbit, sentry, linear, etc. GPT-5 is coming, but only time will tell how good it actually is for coding, but early returns look promising. A Claude code subscription for $17 is probably the way to go. Note: I have subs for cursor, windsurf, copilot, anthropic, and perplexity, but Opus 4 is still king. There are some cheaper options to fill in the gaps, I've been hearing good things about Kimi and a few others, but I really try and stick to SOTA models, as I get much better results with much less prompting.</div>

I did not get the impression that OpenAI devs used it. I thought they overused it maybe trying to distill the output to feed into their own models.

Have you heard anything about their developers using it?

**edit**: [Here is where I got this impression from.](https://np.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mfje8d/comment/n6hijev)

&gt; **Title**: "Looks like the OpenAI were the ones abusing the [Claude Code] limits."
&gt;
&gt; **Comment**: Lol, doesn't this imply OpenAI devs have been streaming propriety ChatGPT code straight to Anthropic's servers?
&gt;
&gt; **Answer**: That’s a stretch. The most likely explanation is that they were just doing competitive analysis, or at worst adding Opus data to their training set.
&gt; 
&gt; **Answer**: they were probably trying to replicate how claude code works so well and using that to try to improve codex as nobody actually uses it.
&gt;
&gt; **Answer**: i would assume getting some synthetic data
&gt; 
&gt; **Answer**: probably scraping reasoning chain
