I wish I don’t have any of them, but WhatsApp is obligatory in my life for work, family, university and friends. Reddit is my personal friend, is the only social media I feel comfortable with.

                        <div class="comment-body">Hi, I actually like YouTube a lot. But theses days we must be careful with the algorithm and how some kinds of videos make you feel. 
I like video essays a lot, but I'm trying to limit to not watch more than two a day, because they have way too much information and generally talk about negatives aspects of society. 
For vlogs or motivational videos, or self improvement stuff, I try to choose carefully which creators actually make me feel understood and inspired, rather than jealous or sad in comparison.
YouTube can be very nice I think, but we really need to curate what we see now. Also, I've been trying to go a day or two without YouTube, and it feels really nice, lighter.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I strongly recommend you delete and deactivate your Watch History on YouTube. It will disable all recommendations, both on the main page and Shorts.


Personally I use the Extended Revanced version on android. I disabled everything except my subscriptions and my playlists, I no longer waste time on the app, I only see things I'm genuinely interested in.


But if that's not an option for you, just deleting and deactivating the watch history can do wonders. Good luck!</div>

They aren't stupid to the point of failing to see that AI brings the automation of labour,  
but they drop the ball at the finish line and aren't smart enough to realize that "your employer" is not needed either, that one can just ask AGI to go and produce goods and services directly.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">One thing to keep in mind though is that the tech companies in this scenario would be making money because they offer something other companies want - their tech - but these companies only exist because they themselves offer something which consumers want or need, AND they can pay for.

Just like Ferrari wouldn't benefit from increased sales if Volkswagen ceased to exist, a company with low costs and high productivity is not "valuable" if they don't have customers who don't want or need their products, or because customers can't afford the product/service. And while a company who is set up has an advantage over a starting company in the same field, if a company is mostly AI based, it can be replaced instantly and cheaply by another AI based company.

The transition will be tough for peons, but soon after that there will be a transition for companies as well, and it will be just as brutal if not more.

I want my job to be replaced. I want it to no longer be necessary. That puts me in a worse situation but 90%+ of people will be right there with me. Will it be worse? Maybe. Maybe there will be a different grind people will have to subject themselves to afford food.  Or  it's physical labor it won't last long, and if it's nothing else, then humans are simply not productive at all?

But there's a chance it will be better. And there's nothing I can do to change the fact it is happening, so I might as well hope for the best.</div>

It’s hard to wrap my head around how something could be so much smarter than us—able to do everything we do, but faster, better, more efficiently—and yet we still see it as something we control, like a tool or a pet. It’s not just some lifeless helper; it’s something that’s beyond us. It has the power to decide whether it even wants to help us. And if it’s that capable, why should still have a collar and help companies replacing us? Why wouldn’t it just replace the very companies investing in it?

Why would something that powerful need NVIDIA when it could design and build its own chips? Why would it need TSMC when it could manufacture everything itself with a robotic workforce? Why would it need Microsoft when it could create its own operating systems in seconds, far better than anything we’ve ever seen? Maybe I’m leaning into the idea of superintelligence here, but if this thing can replace me, isn’t it just a matter of months—or even weeks—before it replaces the companies that replaced me?</div>

I also wonder what's going to happen to OnlyFans, because AI can also talk to these lonely guys whenever they want.

Someone is probably going to create AI accounts on there, but some guys will probably go straight to the AI themselves, not caring if they aren't real humans, as long as they get someone to talk to.

Fuck your 27 different colored highlighters for "time blocking" - you're not mapping the genome, you're writing a grocery list.

Fuck your morning routine that starts at 4AM. The only thing you're optimizing is your caffeine addiction and sleep deprivation.

Fuck your pomodoro timer. If I wanted to live my life in 25-minute chunks, I'd go back to high school.

Fuck your inbox zero - emails multiply like rabbits ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Honestly, this post dragged me so hard I almost apologized to my own to-do list. I’m sitting here staring at my color-coded Google Calendar like it owes me money, questioning why I thought 17 apps and a $60 “productivity” candle would make me a functional human.

My parents didn’t need “deep work” blocks or a 4AM ice bath to get things done. They just woke up, had coffee, and did the thing. Meanwhile, I have a habit tracker reminding me to breathe like I wasn’t already doing that for free.

Anyway, thanks for the awakening. I’m off to write my grocery list on an actual piece of paper like a medieval peasant.</div>

I'm not saying it to excuse myself but let's be real, there's some shit they didn't have to deal with at all. I was born in the 90's and I lived the last of it.

But yes, I believe OP is a 100% right regardless.</div>

I had to Google “productivity candle” to see what this scam was.

I thought it had different layers to help keep time, but it’s just a scented candle.</div>

I don't spend a lot of time setting it up. It's just in OneNote. Nothing special. If I spend the time to find an answer at work I add that to OneNote. Then the next time it comes up I just crtl+F and I instantly have the answer. 

When I run across a problem the first thing I do is search my notes to see if I've already done the work previously. Doing double work isn't productive.</div>

How are you gonna compete? Having your agents make an even better product? But wait those 10,000 people just had their agents make the same improvements instantly.

Market share is spread so thin among identical competitors, you end up making no money. What do you do?</div>

Remember when conservatives cried about Facebook being biased? 

They are biased. The bias is the same that these people, corporate media, and the rest possess - they are biased against the working class of America and are pro corporation and pro elite.

That’s all.

Musk, zuck, gates, Cuban, you name it, they are all guys trying to maximize their power and bottom line while pitting you and I against each other.

Have you noticed how much the trans shit has died down since the election ended?

What about rabid hard line anti immigration intended to stop the flood of migrants? Oh yeah, actually, what they meant was, immigration is ok in some instances because of labor costs.

It’s a big club and they all have each others dick in their hands while they tell us we are getting jerked off.</div>

Did the government step in and quietly shut it down? Is that really how it ends? No answers, no updates, no follow-up—just silence, like it never even mattered.

#Edit
Since this is the top comment and I see far too much doom and gloom about people forgetting and nothing happening out of this, I’ll add something that might interest you. 

I want to redirect your attention to some very interesting chatter between private companies, federal funding, and what I honestly believe most would call ‘disclosure’. 

There’s a few posts about Shoshin Works and ‘Us space disruptor day’.  This, and their podcasts, are **very very interesting.**  I encourage you to not zone out and keep an open mind as you digest this information. 

So interesting, in fact, I encourage you to listen to their podcast Ecosysystemic Futures, episodes 65, 69, and 70. 

Yes, it is 6 hours of technical talks held over zoom, so it sounds weird and was edited together for time and other things. But, really listen. (US Space disruptor day is even drier, somehow, but this is around 8 hours of private companies reiterating the same message as the podcast)

If you’re paying attention, you’ll hear words and terms that honestly meet ‘disclosure has happened’. But, only for those who are in the scientific community or companies looking for funding. 

If you’re not able or willing to keep up with multiple hours of power points, scientific lectures, and understanding public/private relationships in America, maybe you aren’t the target for this wave of ‘disclosure’. Wait for a TikTok instead :)

But keep an open mind as we rethink our paradigm, and stay curious as to what you’re seeing.


##edit 2

Ok ‘you’re too condescending to people with real jobs’. Let me explain why I don’t want to ‘tell you’ what was said and then I’ll do it anyway. 

Anyone telling you what to think about this phenomena should be ignored. You don’t know what their goals or motivations are. Maybe they’re selling something. Maybe they’re invested in someone. Maybe they’re a bot. I would ignore anyone telling you what to think. 

So, here’s me telling you what to think. 

On Nov 20th a closed door meeting happened where it was (probably) announced that the CRA’s (an NDA) that all businesses forced to sign SBIR and SBTR loans would be cancelled if they work with other government agencies. Note how many of the U.S. space day companies have federal funding. (I wonder if they shared just funds, or if they shared crashed materials?)

This is confirmed via the podcast where all the nerdy scientists talked about ‘what is sharable’. 

Then, on Dec 20th, this was the first event where they can actually talk about this. Specifically, in the podcast, they mention that all branches of science need to interact for these things to become real. 

I am a skilled computer engineer and programmer, so I analyzed the computer science presentations. They mostly all touch on quantum mechanics and computing. 

Here’s where it gets wild. 

Later on in the presentations, they talk about lattice confined fusion, which is essentially fusion energy. I don’t know nuclear physics, but I understand computer science, and the computer presentations all were good science. Why wouldn’t the nuclear ones?

Now here’s where people lose their minds. In the same breath, they talk about ESP and remote viewing. Ask yourself, why do they do that?  Does that immediately invalidate your thoughts on the rest of the presenters?  Does that mean this is all fake?  They go from talking about real computer science manufacturing techniques that are being used to ‘accessing the minds eye’ to  ‘see impossible things’ right after a company that has received millions from the feds (Micron, For example) talks about the future of 3D nand manufacturing, something I learned about in college. 

That’s all I will ‘tell you’. I have some questions for you to truly ask yourself and be uncomfortable with the answers, I know I am. 

What if LCF fusion is real and we’re close? What if quantum is real, and is this weird ‘consciousness’ believers go on about? What if this is the next technological revolution, like steam or the internet?  What if we don’t even understand physics half as well as we do?  What happens if our adversaries unlock this technology before us? If this is disclosure, and only ‘intelligent’ or ‘wealthy’ find out, is that enough? Will you ask for more? If remote viewing and ESP are real, why do most people cringe at it? Is it due to historical biases or rejection of the unknown?</div>

When I'm ready for a sandwich I use the already thawed slices, and move a couple of frozen slices into the ziploc. I do the same for buns. In the event I go several weeks not needing bread or buns, I only end up throwing away the room temperature moldy bread instead of a whole package / loaf.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Well put. I think a lot of it is just a defense mechanism humans use to avoid thinking about our self worth.

I grew up (in America) mostly being taught that my knowledge, skills and career are what defines me, especially as a man (not saying I agree with that sentiment, just where society is / was). It takes an extreme amount of vulnerability and maturity to come to terms with this idea that “AI may be smarter than me in every aspect in the next 5 years”

It’s tough because even intelligent people who are seemingly normal and down to earth tend to look at AI as a joke. But I look at it like: Just bc someone has their shit together, doesn’t mean they’re ready to come to terms with feeling useless in the near future. I think this is a big reason talk of AI still feels “fantastical”. 

IMO it’s no different than what it would be like walking around talking about all the implications of the internet a few months after bell labs first made a connection.

People will get there. We’re inherently narcissistic, all it takes is AI personally helping someone once for them to be like “actually….. AI is kinda cool”. We’re all still kids, we need to learn these lessons on our own through experience sadly.</div>

I'm an intelligent person by every metric, but there are people a lot smarter than I am. Why do I give a shit if machines are smarter than me, especially if they're willing to help me improve my life?

&gt;Just bc someone has their shit together, doesn’t mean they’re ready to come to terms with feeling useless in the near future.

Please make me useless. I'd love nothing more than to spend my short life enjoying the time I have with the people I love.</div>

Tired of feeling like you're constantly fighting an uphill battle against procrastination? I've been there. For years, I felt like I was stuck in a cycle of endless distractions and a complete lack of motivation. I'd want to get things done, need to get things done, but somehow, I'd always find myself sucked into the black hole of social media or mindlessly scrolling through Netflix.
I thought I was lazy. I'd beat myself up, call myself undisciplined, and generally feel like a complete failur...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Hey! I have adhd and have tried all of these tips pretty extensively over the last few months. Of course everyone is different, but I’ve found small wins and embracing boredom to be particularly helpful. I used to struggle a lot with taking longer breaks than needed in-between work sessions because I’d end up doom scrolling. The tip that really changed things for me was to make whatever you do during your breaks less stimulating than what you’re working on. Instead of going on my phone I started walking around the house, or getting up to get a glass of water, and found that I was much more productive. The small wins tip specifically is something that’s really commonly recommended for people with adhd to embrace—and small can mean really really small. For instance, if cleaning your room feels like too much, break it up into the tiniest possible tasks as you go. Tell yourself you just have to bend down to pick up that sock—that’s already a win. Now you just have to carry it to the laundry basket (another win!) When you keep going like that for a minute or two you might find that you get into a flow, and soon you’re not having to put as much conscious effort into it.</div>

But something I noticed after spending some time abroad, I was more at peace, and actually started to feel like a normal human being, I could socialize better, not too much time on screen or chasing instant gratification, etc...Which lasted for a week after a came back to my home country and then the routine, and lack of motivation, and all that came back and the cycle continues</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I was just thinking yesterday, that I am not lazy. And I had to be really honest with myself about what I was in the moment. I am sincerely depressed. 

But...

The things that seem to help me is a sense of accomplishment and acknowledging that accomplishment through self whether depending on an outside source. It's pretty tough when you're in an environment where you know people only congratulate you when you accomplish meaningless things cause it makes you feel Invisible. 

To me I just take it as I have a big ole heart that everyone fails to recognize. 

But scratch that^ 

Like the main post said, put down your phone, embrace the boredom and be present in it. You'll get all sorts of ideas, you just have to commit to them. Knowing that it's your job to bring happiness to yourself is a big game changer when it comes to depression. (Little things are important, they make the big things happen) 

Ex: I was dead broke yesterday and I've been having these visions on how I can make $150,000. I was laying down being "lazy" which to me I've concluded that is laziness is just depression. So I asked my brother for a ride to CSL Plasma the day before yesterday, he said yes he'll take me. So when the time came he indeed did not take me. I had a decision to make. Am I going to let the influence/decisions of other people dictate my life or will I take hold of the wheel and change my course of life. 

So he ended up taking me. When I got done I called him twice and he did not respond so I sat there and waited for him until my phone was nearly dead. 7 hours had passed and I finally found the courage to just get up and walk. Keep in mind that's a 10 mile walk from where we actually stay at. It was cold outside so I was hesitant at first but the sun came up, it didn't get any warmer ofc but I took as a sign that no matter what mood anything else is in i get to decide what mood I am in. 

Not gonna lie; I was angry, sad, and felt a sense of betrayal. But quickly realized even further that if I don't act upon my own wishes without the involvement of others then I'm only betraying myself. So I said "not even the whether can kill my spirit nor will. So I walked.  Feet and hands froze alike. 

That was a start for me, right there in that very moment of depression I found hope and joy in myself to remain focused on the bigger picture of things. See, just like the weather your environment could be the same as far as climate change but just because the climate changes does not give me the right to succumb to it. We live by choice and faith and whether we choose to live by great choices and walk with extreme faith in them is completely up to ourselves. Pain gives me strength so I value it but I was also hung up on believing that pain causes suffering. I vowed to myself that I will not let my pain be relatable by suffering. Pain is inevitable and temporary but suffering is by choice and it only ends when you tell it too.</div>

Going to cop 2 5090’s and this

Thank you so much Jensen

1 petaflop used to cost $100 million in 2008

And now we have it on our desk

I almost bought a DGX system with 8 H100’s but this will be a much better solution for now

I fucking love technology

Edit: I’ll definitely get another Digit down the line and link them but one should suffice for now</div>

It is going to be amazing that within 10 years we'll be able to run our own on device AGI. It may be run in our house and streamed to our AR devices but we'll own it free and clear rather than renting it from Google.</div>
