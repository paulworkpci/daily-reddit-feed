                        <div class="comment-body">I just asked Qwen2.5-Max how many R are in strawberry and it said: 

&gt;Sure! Let's carefully analyze the word **"strawberry"** .

&gt;The letters in the word are: **s, t, r, a, w, b, e, r, r, y** .

&gt;Now, we count how many times the letter **"r"** appears:

&gt;The first **"r"** is the 3rd letter.

&gt;The second **"r"** is the 8th letter.

&gt;The third **"r"** is the 9th letter.

&gt;So, there are **3 occurrences** of the letter **"r"** in the word "strawberry".

&gt;**Final Answer:** 3​

                <div class="post-content">VoxGPT technique - if you go to the same uni as me (won't say the name but ifkyk), you would've heard this being explained a couple of times by professors.

1. explain any topic to chatgpt
2. Ask for improvements to fill in knowledge gaps
3. Rinse and repeat.

That's basically a rough overview, but if you search it up on google, you can find so much info on how to properly do it to learn effectively.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;believe Deepseek was funded w 5m

No. Because Deepseek never claimed this was the case. $6M is the compute cost estimation of the one final pretraining run. They never said this includes anything else. In fact they specifically say this:

&gt; Note that the aforementioned costs include only the official training of DeepSeek-V3, excluding the costs associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Because the media misunderstood, again. They confused GPU hour cost with total investment. 

The $5m number isn’t how many chips they have but how much it costs in H800 GPU hours for the final training costs.

It’s kind of like a car company saying “we figured out a way to drive 1000 miles on $20 worth of gas.” And people are freaking out going  “this company only spent $20 to develop this car”.</div>

Let me phrase it another way young man, to help you find your tongue... You and I are no different than cattle to be traded on the stock market. When AI coupled by robotics becomes sophisticated enough to replace 90% of the jobs on earth, what do you think they're going to do with an unemployed populace. They'll let them die because AI will be controlled by the oligarchy, and by that time they will only buy and sells goods with each other because they no longer need a human work force. 

We initially went from the Star Trek in the 20th century to a freight train of an Elysium tracjectory in a span of two years when LLM's went live. Hell, this isn't even a hypothetical anymore, just look what our good ol friends the [Israelis are doing](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza) with AI surveillance to target Gazan's with no disctinction between civilian or enemy combatant. They are literally writing the blue print that will be applied on American soil when the time comes of civil unrest. And I'm afraid it's going to be used within this decade.</div>

I would love to ask them seriously, what would you have done before social media? 

They all act as if they always *knew* the 9-5 wasn't for them. 

So my question is, if the 9-5 was never for you, then what would you have all done before 2005? 

Genuine question. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Fair enough, but my question is, without social media, what would these people have done? 

I mean, let's not forget most creative people like artists, painters, writers, etc, didn't make any money when they were alive. 

The point im making is, the gen Z like to preach how they *always knew* working 9-5 wasn't for them, but without social media they WOULD HAVE HAD TO. (Does that make sense?) 

Im just wondering 2 things; why they innitially believe what they believe, and what would they have done if social media wasn't around?</div>

Endorses man who wants to deport 20M undocumented people, when something like 1/3 of Texas construction is undocumented. Wonder if Trump will send ICE to raides in TX or just Boston and Chicago.

Literally the advantage of even having a society is to work together.

And to work together we need to have shared rules that all obey.

To have shared rules means to have similar values, similar goals, similar ethics and morals.</div>

At the point, I would rather listen to all the runners, hunters, comedians, just Jesus, anything but these sky is falling boomers.</div>

Went from a philosophical/motivation/male figure to a slow descent into a crusader against wokeness. Some of it I get because the media started unfairly crucifying in like 2018 or 2019 but then he latched on to the anti woke movement and never looked back. 

The other guys are bums because from the get go they were always grifters.</div>

 They are almost certainly going to have the snacks you want, the drinks you want, usually something hot if you're feeling lunch-ish

Official Representative for the Joint Chiefs of Staff (12/14/24): Right now, the FBI, DHS, FAA and DOD have been unable to determine who is responsible for flying the drones, and there's no indication that there are adversary nations involved.

"To date, we have no intelligence or observations that would indicate that they were aligned with a foreign actor or that they had malicious intent," the spokesperson said. "But ... we don't know. We have not been able to locate or identify the operators or the points of origin."

                        <div class="comment-body">The worst part in this is that Deepseek's claim has been that V3 (released in December 20th) takes 5.5 million for the **final** model training cost. It's not the hardware. It's not even how much they actually spent on the model. It's just an accounting tool to showcase their efficiency gains. It's not even R1. They don't even claim that they only have \~6 million dollars of equipment. 

Our media and a bunch of ya'll have made bogus comparisons and unsupported generalizations all because ya'll too lazy to read the conclusions of a month-old open access preprint and do a comparison to an American model and see that the numbers are completely plausible.

&gt;Lastly, we emphasize again the economical training costs of DeepSeek-V3, summarized in Table 1, achieved through our optimized co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware. During the pre-training stage, training DeepSeek-V3 on each trillion tokens requires only 180K H800 GPU hours, i.e., 3.7 days on our cluster with 2048 H800 GPUs. Consequently, our pre- training stage is completed in less than two months and costs 2664K GPU hours. Combined with 119K GPU hours for the context length extension and 5K GPU hours for post-training, DeepSeek-V3 costs only 2.788M GPU hours for its full training. Assuming the rental price of the H800 GPU is $2 per GPU hour, our total training costs amount to only $5.576M. **Note that the aforementioned costs include only the official training of DeepSeek-V3, excluding the costs associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data.**

                                <div class="reply-body">FINALLY other people seeing this. I've been ranting about this since 2 days ago. 

The media (and the financially illiterate public) basically conflated and compared **a fraction of operating expenses** with **capital expenses and salaries** and ran away with it. I swear to god financial literacy needs to be a mandatory course for people to graduate high school. 

Like, I know all of you have seen plenty of people on Reddit conflating "profit" and "revenue", wanting to tax corporations on their revenues and not realizing it doesn't fucking work that way. 

Except this time, the (intentional?) mistake wiped out $1T in market cap. So fucking dumb.


I have seen some random people estimating Llama 3 actually took around $30M-$60M to train (which makes the $5.5M figure a lot more reasonable - I expect efficiency gains after 8 months, especially considering models are densing at a very fast rate https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04315)

A TON of people posting how Deepseek made R1 for $5M and compare to other companies spending billions, when the $5M number isn't even referring to R1 but V3. We also don't know how many failed training runs they had, how much it costed them to get their data, all the human resources, capex, etc etc etc.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Protein folding is one of those cases where generative approaches are very useful, because normally you can't do much better than brute force. But even if AI is only sometimes halfway accurate, in a field where a solution is easily verified 'sometimes halfway accurate' is a great improvement other 'always at random'.

Besides the pointless chatbot hype, I can kinda see AI becoming a truly ubiquitous method in these cases that don't have much better solutions than 'try a whole lot', where you would run your simulation or search algorithm, and use AI to bend it in the right direction so that your solution takes five months to show up instead of fifty years.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Life is tied to DNA (code). We give AI parts of the code that correspond to something, say a Giraffe.

We then give it an overview of how molecules interact in nature (evolve). We then ask it to finish the code under the same process that nature uses.

But AI didn’t give us back a Giraffe precisely, instead a very similar animal that has stripes instead.

This shows us that evolution, even within its predefined laws of nature and the same environment, could have gone down different paths.

When we think of the applications of our knowledge of life and DNA, we’ve focused on what evolution gave us, but now we can better see what it didn’t give us and start to use those applications too.</div>

For me the idea that the world would unite and put their best minds to work to fight them is just completely bonkers. But coming from a technocratic single party state which indeed directs public policy and just gets things done, it makes perfect sense. But the world agreeing to a very clever set of ideas and following them through? Would never happen. Fun read though. I read the first book and watched the netflix show. The show had some pretty cool moments and it was nice to visualise how the trisolarans are described in the books.</div>

\- No mentions of size. It's MoE, that's all we know.  
\- No open weights  
\- It's pretty expensive compared to Deepseek V3. 10$/M input tokens, 30$/M output tokens (Qwen) compared to 0.14$/M input and 0.28$/M output (DeepSeek).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This price is crazy, I can't imagine what it takes to be so costly. However I think it can be partially explained with hardware used, Deepseek is inferring on some new Huawei hardware and my thinking is it must be wildly good because inference speed is great and other inference services for Deepseek v3 are comparatively slow and they have their servers based on GPUs. On one hand deepseek v3 has not too many active parameters, but it does take a lot of GPUs to spread all these weights in q16 form, so they must have a lot of memory available to be so fast and cheap.</div>
