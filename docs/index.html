                <div class="post-content">Recently I realized the reason I've been struggling to get anything done has been because of YouTube. I'm a heavy addict. (9 hours a day bad). I've uninstalled all music apps, YouTube, any social media, and discord. Really anything besides a browser I can't use. I've had serious withdrawals but I held strong and I plan to keep going for 3 weeks to hopefully to be, better able to manage my time, as well stop using YouTube as a distraction.
Here's my experience so far.

                        <div class="comment-body">Campbell's at Glencoe were pretty despicable.

Edit for reference: "The Glencoe Massacre (1692) was a brutal episode in Scottish history where government soldiers many from Clan Campbell, under orders from King William III, killed 38 members of Clan MacDonald of Glencoe. The MacDonalds had delayed swearing allegiance to the king after the Glorious Revolution, and this was used as a pretext for punishment. The most infamous part was that the Campbell soldiers had been living as guests among the MacDonalds for nearly two weeks, sharing food and shelter, before turning on them in the early morning hours. It wasn’t just a massacre—it was a betrayal, seen as a chilling example of state-sanctioned violence and clan politics. The event left a lasting scar and symbolized the deep mistrust between Highland clans and the central government."</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Corfitz Ulfeldt is not well known outside of Scandinavia, but very bad.

In a quick recap he was in a top position under the Danish king in the mid 1600's, but did a bunch a corrupt stuff (allegedly) and fled to Sweden who had been the mortal enemies of Denmark for hundreds of years.

Here he started working for the Swedish king and didn't just tell him every Danish secret he knew, but  deliberate did everything he could to enrage the swedes against the Danes, so they would declare them war.

After a few years he succeeded and he didn't just help the Swedish tropes from the front lines (again with a bunch of important information about the Danish army and the landscape), he also let the Swedish king borrow insane amounts of money from him that he had stolen from the Danish treasury. Money that was then used to buy mercenaries for the invasion. 

The swedes won and Ulfeldt got his own lands back and even a Danish island for his troubles. But it wasn't long before the Swedish king also started being annoyed with Ulfeldt who now fled back to Denmark where he was arrested. 

For some insane reason he was eventually allowed to leave the country because he said he needed to go to a spa for his health. Of course he didn't go to a spa and fled Denmark once again. This time he went to a bunch of different kings in Europe and tried to get them in on his crazy schemes essentially. He also gave the skull of one of the biggest Danish saints to the French, another thing he had stolen. 

He even tried to arrange a coup of the Danish throne, but without luck. The Danes never got him again, but his wife was famously imprisoned in a tower for 22 years, essentially in her husband's place. 

Ulfeldt was so hated in Denmark that a "statue of shame" was erected for him, that people were supposed to spit on as they walked past. It stood in Copenhagen for hundreds of years.</div>

What actually made a difference for me was a simple shift:

Realizing that I get distracted in *two completely different ways*:

1. Sometimes I **want** to focus (like during study or deep work), but my mind wanders.

2. Other times I **don’t even realize I’m picking up my phone** — it’s just habit.

                        <div class="comment-body">For anyone who is 10 years old (like me):  
Okay, imagine you have a super-duper hard math problem, way harder than anything in school. It's like a giant puzzle with lots of confusing pieces.

This scientist had a puzzle like that about tiny, tiny magnets all lined up in a row.

1. **The Puzzle:** How do these tiny magnets behave when they can point in, say, 3 different directions (not just North/South, but maybe North/South/East)? This puzzle had a giant, messy instruction sheet (called a "matrix"). It was 9 rows and 9 columns of complicated stuff! Too hard to solve by hand.
2. **The AI Helper:** The scientist asked a very smart computer program (the AI) for help, like asking a genius friend to help with homework.
3. **What the AI Did:**
   * The scientist asked the AI to work on the puzzle just for the 3-direction magnets.
   * The AI did a lot of the hard math calculations, like using a super-calculator.
   * It helped write down that giant, messy 9x9 instruction sheet.
   * **Most importantly:** The AI helped figure out a secret trick to make the giant, messy sheet into a tiny, simple one (just 2 rows and 2 columns!). This solved the puzzle for the 3-direction magnets!
4. **Like a Clue:** Solving the puzzle for 3 directions was super helpful. It was like the AI gave the scientist a big clue for how to solve the puzzle for any number of directions (4, 5, 100, any number!).
5. **The Scientist's Big Idea:** Seeing how the AI simplified the 3-direction puzzle helped the scientist figure out the trick for all the other puzzles!

**So, the AI didn't solve the whole giant puzzle for every possibility, but it solved one really important piece (the 3-direction one), and doing that showed the scientist the secret trick needed to solve the rest!** The AI was like a helpful tool that cracked one part, leading to the big discovery.</div>

They sprint toward productivity… then crash.

Japanese teachings taught me this about slowing down to actually move faster.

Kaizen - “Continuous Improvement”

Instead of overhauling my entire life, I focused on small, daily gains:
1% better at French every day.
1 more rep in the gym.
1 cleaner system to manage my week.
Kaizen helped me sustain progress without burning out.

Shinrin-yoku - “Forest Bathing”

As someone who lived in Japan. Studied Japanese, and married a Japanese national, please do not push these as teachings. These aren't some philosophical things that all Japanese practice and pass on to their children and whatnot. It's western culture distorting that as something more than it really is.

I'm glad you found purpose in it but you need to know the truth behind those "teachings".</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/MW2077:

---

Jake Barber just confirmed they're *already* working with Jay H. Hunter’s 8K camera rig. This could seriously raise the bar for future UAP footage quality.

I don’t need to gouge everyone at every level in order to hoard the maximum amount of wealth possible.  Unfortunately, we’re in end-stage capitalism now. Where the only thing that matters is extracting the maximum amount of money out of every person at any cost for the least amount of investment possible.  It is truly grotesque what This country/planet has become. Greed. Human nature will destroy everything in the end.</div>

Sure, in econ textbooks and in the minds of libertarians, but in reality maximizing profit has always been the central drive in capitalism. It's not a moral or greed thing. It's just how the system functions</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly. Publicly traded companies that answer to shareholders are the issue. If you remain private, you can decide whatever the hell you want. 

The perfect example I use for this is fast food places. They are all great quality when they first start out, providing a great product. Once they go public, they slowly start trading quality for shareholder profits, and get worse over time. It has literally happened to every single fast food place that has ever went public. Wendy's was great under Dave Thomas, went to shit after his death. You can see the same thing happening to papa johns and now chipotle. 

On a counter example, think of the fast food places that are still great quality and people love to go to? Chik Fil A, In-n-out, culvers are notable examples. These companies are not publicly traded, and  therefore maintain their high quality despite not fully maximizing their profits, and people flock to these places in droves because they know they will get good service and quality.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/merecuriousity:

---

Saw it yesterday 4/12 late afternoon. It seemed to move at a stable speed in a very determined/controlled way and wasn't swayed by the wind. It's hard to say if it was black or shiny but I lean black/gray. Not sure where it started or where it ended, just saw it from my deck. I see other videos of orbs and spheres but they all seem metal or shiny. Curious if this is in fact an identifiable flying object

It is moving with the wind so it could be a balloon. But the consistent speed and straight line does look odd. The wind is gusting based on the tree movement but that thing isn’t deviating its path or speed at all.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Adding to this, when you *finish* doing stuff with your phone (or every several minutes), take a second and think if you enjoyed that session. Not in a judgemental way, but rather questioning if it was a good use of your time.

Many times, you'll say "yeah sure, it was a good time filler", but sometimes you'll think "no, not really". It makes these sessions more intentional.

Even with the help of the U.S. and Europe, unless it escalated to full on nuclear war. In which case nobody have won, of course. 

Mainstream media seemed to point to the fact that it was winnable. Advocating for more spending in that direction, despite the obvious prospects</div>

It’s instantly evident how savvy and knowledgeable they are in politics compared to the alternative media crew like Tim Pool, Joe Rogan or Dave Smith. They know the system inside out and make these other podcasters look what they are, basically uninformed amateurs.</div>

He's not saying you can't have an opinion or make observations. He's saying you shouldn't get up on a pedestal and announce to the world that you see the truth when you're just a random dip shit with an opinion.

The issue with Americans is that you all think your opinions matter the same as everyone elses--they don't.</div>

He claimed that no matter how you define it, it would meet that criteria. I do agree with him that others have moved the goalposts for what AGI is, but I also think he moved them too just in the opposite direction. He shifted the definition backward to make it seem like he predicted something accurately, which he did not.</div>

Had what we have today come out 10 years ago there would be damn near unanimous consent that we had AGI at that point, but since it didn't then every step of the way everyone has been saying, "Wait, this could definitely be better." - and it could, every single time, which is pretty damn awesome. But we have still passed multiple goalposts on this that in the past would have been an absolute victory.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is the problem with the vast majority of people who have strong opinions on when we'll have AGI.

They don't actually present a specific and objectively measurable criteria for what they consider to be AGI -- so they're always free to say "I was right!" quite simply by retroactively adjusting the definition so as to fit whatever we happen to have at the date they predicted.

None of them have a: "Something is AGI if it can pass \*this\* specific test!" kinda definition.</div>

Yes, the new one goes off track a little bit, but also low-key, you're just running into a kind of Uncanny Valley effect here: There's not enough detail in the old output for your brain to register how will-smith-like it is. Only the new one is close enough and detailed enough that you notice this differences.

Also note: The new clips are like 2x - 3x longer than the old clips.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Gemini 2.5 Pro's leaderboard entry has been updated with cost data, now that it's accessible via a paid API. Running the Aider Polyglot coding benchmark on Gemini costs $6. Cheaper than all top 10 models except those from DeepSeek.

                                <div class="reply-body">This is being underhyped. Cost matters a lot. Look at GitHub Copilot's upcoming pricing changes. They are charging more for "premium requests". In the $40 tier you will get 1500 of them per month. But there's a cost multiplier per model:

https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests

TL;DR is that Gemini 2.5 Pro has a 1x multiplier while o1 has a **10x** multiplier due to being so much more costly. So if you're using Copilot in your VS Code you can query o1 150 times a month, or Gemini 2.5 Pro **1,500 times per month.**

Interestingly o3-mini has a 0.25x multiplier so they're charging you 4x less to use it than Gemini 2.5 Pro.</div>

I love the little details, like the differently colored cubes, the decision to go for a nicer-looking circular cake over a plain cube when the prompt was a minecraft cake, the little darker coffee fines in the coffee.. You know what they mean? This thing has aestheticism baked into it, it doesn't just pass it wants to pass with flying colors, that is really good.

I think my favorite by far is the fifth one, extremely hard prompt but it did a great job.

Anyway, good spatial reasoning and long term planning will translate well into many other applications. Can't wait for the next 5 months.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I propose we should move from Minecraft benchmark to [Space Engineers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnRKOp-Cq8c) benchmark in terms of spatial reasoning because Minecraft benchmark will be saturated quite soon.

First of all, it has a very straightforward XML file format for storing ship data, so it might be easier to work with for LLMs

Second, it will be easy to set up objective metrics for the design - "ship must have enough thrust to land on Earth", "ship must be able to take off into space", "ship must have a jump range of 6000 Km", "ship must have those functional blocks", "ship must have guided missiles", "ship must be able to land automatically", "ship must be able to hover in 1g gravity for an hour"; "design a 4-seater car that relies on battery power", "design a mobile base with articulated suspension".

Third, there are a lot of logistical problems, like installing enough fuel tanks, power sources, thrusters with different amounts in different directions, and also automation blocks (SE's better alternative to redstone).

Fourth, there is also a huge knowledge base in terms of Steam Workshop that models can be trained on.

And in the end the builds can be rated on both objective criteria (functionality) and subjective (style).</div>
