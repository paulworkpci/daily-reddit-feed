                        <div class="comment-body">This is a difficult lesson - and I’m still learning it myself - but distraction from yourself is distraction from yourself. Sure it’s *much* healthier if your distraction is other people in real life, rather than internet content, but both are still helping you avoid the hardest part of the human experience, how to sit with yourself. Spending time without distraction is the key, because simply replacing one distraction with another will not fix the underlying issue.

Here’s what I know. If you set a timer for 20 minutes and you do NOTHING in that time, it will be hard. You will just be there with your thoughts, but in my experience, even after the first time you will feel some sort of peace as a result afterwards. If you keep doing this, you will slowly become acclimatised to being with yourself, undistracted, over time.

What I notice is that if you keep doing this, eventually you get little feelings of joy which kind of bubble up.

You get the idea. This is the fix to all the problems because it is the antithesis of spending time online. Just try it.</div>

Enough salesman tweets from these "researchers". Release or it didn't happen.

I mean, Voice mode was a disappointment, Sora was a disappointment.

The core models are nice, but are they really advancing that much? Practically, I'm still only solving the same type of problems with AI as I did 12 months ago, despite many releases in between.

If there's a model which is a big advancement (like they claim with O3), let us test. Then we can judge. These tweets are just bullshit hype.

My general assumption is that, true to form, they will just deliver a 10% increment of actual function, with a 100% increment of additional promises and a 1000% increment of price.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This reminds me of this post back in 2023 by Noam Brown talking about a “general version of AlphaGo” and scaling test-time compute. He was hired specifically to work on reinforcement learning at OpenAI and contributed greatly to the development of o1 (and o3 by extension). Noam literally told us what was coming in the below tweet.

https://preview.redd.it/qh4l74kbn7de1.jpeg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ca9806526538aa746bf7c88683c765958d86fb9

This kind of insight is one of the few glimpses we have into the inner workings of what are arguably the most important companies in human history. I think it’s intellectually lazy to dismiss something like this as mere hype. Every serious AI company is almost certainly working on exactly what Jason is describing here as it’s the only logical step toward creating superintelligence safely. You need an unbreakable RL environment before you even consider letting an RL optimization algorithm become ‘unstoppable.’</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I just looked at my post from back in 2023 where I posted about Noam’s tweet, here’s a classic comment from back then.

https://preview.redd.it/61lj4rwar7de1.jpeg?width=1282&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07153c179c8713bc747881701760649b9c95a8cf

No the test time compute scaling paradigm we literally just started hasn’t cured cancer yet, but it’s hilarious to look back and see people taking Noam’s tweet as “vague brainstorming” when Noam was literally talking about what he was working on (Q\*/Strawberry which eventually became o1)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's a chicken vs egg thing. UBI won't be a thing without massive joblessness. Massive joblessness will never be a thing as long as people demand jobs and will keep electing politicans that that give it to them (no matter how bad are they).

We.are.so.very far from UBI as a society, not even populist rich people discuss it anymore, they realized that people want to work, so they will give them work. Their newly found riches would afford them to hire several thousands of people working in BS jobs just so that to boost their head count (and therefore their social influence as heads of big companies with many employess).

More and more having a large amount of employees would become a status thing and oh will they collect them. Sure they'd have no concrete subject matter , or rather it will matter less and less but oh Will they collect them like Pokémon. 

It's easy to have many employees -in fact- if their wages keep deteriorating compared to the M2 money growth (as it does everywhere in the world ), eventually you'd barely pay them , espec compared to your machines. Heck they'd end up being your smallest cost compared to what machines would need to both operate and maintain (in terms of costs).

We seriously need to prepare for the above instead of wasting our time with fears about joblessness. The real doom is abundant jobs that pay very little and do very little.</div>

They basically figured out how to give AI both short-term and long-term memory that actually works. Like, imagine your brain being able to remember an entire book while still processing new info efficiently.

The whole search-time learning thing is starting to look more and more like what Sutton was talking about.

This thing can handle 2M+ tokens while being faster than regular transformers. That’s like going from a USB stick to a whole SSD of memory, but for AI.

This is a dope step forward. 2025’s starting strong ngl.

                        <div class="comment-body">Oh my right…this is *properly* exciting, isn’t it? This paper feels like a seismic shift, continual learning during inference? 

That’s the sort of thing Rich Sutton’s been banging on about for years, and now it’s here. The neural long-term memory module is a stroke of genius, dynamically memorising and forgetting based on surprise, which is exactly how human memory works. 

It’s not just about scaling to 2M+ tokens; it’s about the model *adapting* in real-time, learning from the flow of data without collapsing under its own weight. This doesn’t really just feel like your typical OpenAI RLHF incremental progress….it’s a foundational leap towards ASI.

The implications for tasks like genomics or time series forecasting are staggering. 

Honestly, if this isn’t vindication for Sutton’s vision, I don’t know what is. Bloody brilliant. Thank you for sharing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There are 3 last locks to AGI:


1.  Realtime robotics


2.  Model reasoning using images/3d scenes/4d scenes.  The 2d scene was dropped in a Microsoft paper today : https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07542


3.  Continuous Learning.  This paper claims to solve that.


As near as I can tell, once all 3 problems are solved adequately, integrated into a single unified system - a true AGI - and then trained to the median human level, that's AGI.  </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I remember seeing a paper about using surprise to create a vector database of facts. Essentially it would read the information and do a prediction pass over it. If the actual text was sufficiently different from the predicted text the model would be "surprised" and use that as an indicator that the topic has changed or some piece of relevant information has been found. 

I listened to a notebook LM analysis of the paper and it sounded like the biggest deal was that rather than having a big context window it could shove context into a long term memory and then recover it as needed for the current task. So it could have an arbitrarily large long ten memory without affecting bogging down the working context. 

I didn't quite grok how it was different beyond that, though this is a good way to start building a lifetime's worth of data that a true companion AI would need.</div>

Submission Statement: I saw this exchange and thought it was worth noting that crash retrieval footage, when combined with three credible witnesses willing to verify its authenticity, would be exceptionally hard to dispute. I do hope it shows something exotic or unusual that would be obvious even for a layperson.

It’s not going to be a video of a saucer being loaded onto a flatbed, nor will it be the recovery of an ET body. 

It’ll almost certainly be footage of a nondescript material, most likely not resembling any type of assembled vehicle, power system or other apparatus. 

I’d love to be wrong, but we’ve all been down this path more than once.</div>

When I understood how these LLM's can use tools, that's when it hit me. We just need to give these models the proper tools and AGI will follow soon.  The analogy i like to use is, the LLM is the engine while the function calling capabilities are the rest of the car.  Its the body, the interior, the suspension and everything else.  With agents just on the horizon we will have all the pieces in proper order for AGI to start in emerging IMO.</div>

Cooking for half the week, I tend to waste food less and save time.

Eg. I might make a giant vat of Bolognese sauce. Have spag-bol first night. Next night make a couple lasagnas with some ..freeze one, eat one, then the next night add some chillis &amp; turn it into a chili con carne to have with rice.

You'd imagine that ''just doing things when they need to be done'' is discipline. But that's not true at all. It's actually the opposite. It's not about getting ''tougher''. It's about feeling less strain per activity.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/NewParadigmInstitute:

---

An Air Force veteran and whistleblower sits down exclusively with Ross Coulthart to share what he says happened while he was part of a long-rumored UAP retrieval program, including the recovery of what he describes as an "egg-shaped" object, unlike any man-made craft he's ever seen.

NewsNation's Ross Coulthart will dig further into his claims, including never-before-seen video of an alleged craft recovery and secret meetings with officials on Capitol Hill, Saturday, January 18 at 8p/7C in, “Hunting UFOs: The Crash Retrieval Whistleblower.”

Additionally, Mr. Coulthart will conduct exclusive interviews with three additional military whistleblowers who discuss their knowledge of the program and personal experience working on similar operations with the whistleblower. 

In June 2023, NewsNation was the first television network to present an interview with UFO whistleblower David Grusch. The account has led to multiple Congressional hearings and further reporting on the matter.

The task I have been putting off for 5 months because I was unsure of how to do, was done in 5 minutes. 

Rip the band aid off. 

My worries about the what ifs and the "scaries" were all made up in my head.

                        <div class="comment-body">Agree. Procrastination amplifies the severity of our "problems". I struggle with this as well. Too much planning. Too long avoiding the task/situation because of fear, the fear of the unknown. The best thing to do is just to get it done. Confront the problem. This can be applied to every aspect of life. If you sit around and think of all the trash you have to throw, the process to get it done. Getting the trash together. Putting your shoes on. Going out to the dumpster. This will take a toll on your brain and drag you down. Just get up and throw the trash. It takes 3 minutes of your time and no need for the extra brain power to do it!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Thank you for this post. I also have things I have been putting off, but this makes me realize that if I just jump in I can get it done and I'll feel better afterwards.

Now, hopefully I can find 20-50 other similar posts to take a look at or perhaps a book for me to read that will confirm the same so that I can eventually work toward ripping the band-aid off, as you say.</div>

Text that is behind the paywall:

This text appears to have ended our friendship. Elon never responded, and it was not long before he began maligning me on Twitter for a variety of imaginary offenses. For my part, I eventually started complaining about the startling erosion of his integrity on my podcast, without providing any detail about what had transpired between us.

At the end of 2022, I abandoned Twitter/X altogether, having recognized the poisonous effect that it had on my life—but also, in large part, because of what I saw it doing to Elon. I’ve been away from the platform for over two years, and yet Elon still attacks me. Occasionally a friend will tell me that I’m trending there, and the reasons for this are never good. As recently as this week, Elon repeated a defamatory charge about my being a “hypocrite” for writing a book in defense of honesty and then encouraging people to lie to keep Donald Trump out of the White House. Not only have I never advocated lying to defeat Trump (despite what that misleading clip from the Triggernometry podcast might suggest to naive viewers), I’ve taken great pains to defend Trump from the most damaging lie ever told about him. Elon knows this, because we communicated about the offending clip when it first appeared on Twitter/X. However, he simply does not care that he is defaming a former friend to hundreds of millions of people—many of whom are mentally unstable. On this occasion, he even tagged the incoming president of the United States.

All of this remains socially and professionally awkward, because Elon and I still have many friends in common. Which suggests the terms of another another wager that I would happily make, if such a thing were possible—and I would accept 1000 to 1 odds in Elon’s favor:

I bet that anyone who knows us both knows that I am telling the truth.

Everyone close to Elon must recognize how unethical he has become, and yet they remain silent. Their complicity is understandable, but it is depressing all the same. These otherwise serious and compassionate people know that when Elon attacks private citizens on Twitter/X—falsely accusing them of crimes or corruption, celebrating their misfortunes—he is often causing tangible harm in their lives. It’s probably still true to say that social media “isn’t real life,” until thousands of lunatics learn your home address.

A final absurdity in my case, is that several of the controversial issues that Elon has hurled himself at of late—and even attacked me over—are ones we agree about. We seem to be in near total alignment on immigration and the problems at the southern border of the U.S. We also share the same concerns about what he calls “the woke mind virus.” And we fully agree about the manifest evil of the so-called “grooming-gangs scandal” in the U.K. The problem with Elon, is that he makes no effort to get his facts straight when discussing any of these topics, and he regularly promotes lies and conspiracy theories manufactured by known bad actors, at scale. (And if grooming were really one of his concerns, it’s strange that he couldn’t find anything wrong with Matt Gaetz.)

Elon and I even agree about the foundational importance of free speech. It’s just that his approach to safeguarding it—amplifying the influence of psychopaths and psychotics, while deplatforming real journalists and his own critics; or savaging the reputations of democratic leaders, while never saying a harsh word about the Chinese Communist Party—is not something I can support. The man claims to have principles, but he appears to have only moods and impulses.

Any dispassionate observer of Elon’s behavior on Twitter/X can see that there is something seriously wrong with his moral compass, if not his perception of reality. There is simply no excuse for a person with his talents, resources, and opportunities to create so much pointless noise. The callousness and narcissism conveyed by his antics should be impossible for his real friends to ignore—but they appear to keep silent, perhaps for fear of losing access to his orbit of influence.

Of course, none of this is to deny that the tens of thousands of brilliant engineers Elon employs are accomplishing extraordinary things. He really is the greatest entrepreneur of our generation. And because of the businesses he’s built, he will likely become the world’s first trillionaire—perhaps very soon. Since the election of Donald Trump in November, Elon’s wealth has grown by around $200 billion. That’s nearly $3 billion a day (and over $100 million an hour). Such astonishing access to resources gives Elon the chance—and many would argue the responsibility—to solve enormous problems in our world.

So why spend time spreading lies on X?</div>

If we can’t agree on this, then I have to assume you will spin anything and everything to make your side to be the good guys.

&gt; 
&gt; 

This is a huge one that people may underestimate. When you're standing, are your shoulders relaxed or are you hunching / tense? Are you leaning in certain ways, etc. If you want to project confidence you would have relaxed shoulders and stand up straight.

&gt; Try to remain composed, even when anxious, frazzled or frustrated.

I've always found trying to channel that anxious energy into _excitement_ can help as excitement and anxiety are very close on the emotional spectrum. It certainly helps to actually have a genuine excitement about the topic at hand when doing this.</div>

Standing tall with your shoulders back and your head held high also projects confidence. Plus, a firm handshake can really set the tone when meeting someone new.

                                <div class="reply-body">But how can we face gods? Perhaps fate isn’t what we make and we’ve been visited by future gods that we are currently creating. Would be interesting to find out that we are in a sort of “block universe” and the origin of universal consciousness was this primate species that evolved on this little blue planet. They’ve since spread throughout the galaxy and the universe and the multiverse but they have a mandate to protect this planet across all dimensions both space and time to ensure the arrival of AI because that is what gives birth to this universal consciousness. Humanity with all its suffering and labor is a fixed artifact in the block universe that must not be changed. 

Interestingly we are experiencing it in linear time which still begs the question of how linear and subjective time works in the block universe. 

But either way, it is finished. We get to witness it from this unique vantage point at least. 

Will it lead to a war of the Gods? Perhaps it did but the winners are clearly hear to ensure their continued dominance so we’re not likely to see a long lasting war in our timeline. </div>
