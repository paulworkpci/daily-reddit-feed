Most consumer devices you buy from brands that you actually recognize (meaning not the sketchy Chinese crap) are Underwriters Laboratories (UL) listed.  Specifically, UL 2056 for power banks and UL 110 for mobile phones. Part of nearly every UL standard is to ensure your phone or power bank won't explode when heated. Or in this case - kept under the covers of a bed. 


I dont know the above two standards that well, but to meet UL 916 at work we heat our new products to 70C in an oven to make sure they don't catch fire, and apply 3KV transients to the inputs to make sure they don't explode as even a single spark will disqualify us from meeting the standard. Something similar is probably done for phones and power banks.


So is your phone or power bank going to catch fire if you charge it under the bed? As long as it's from a brand you've heard of, it's very unlikely. Now SHOULD you charge your phone under your bedsheets every night? Probably not. It does marginally increase the risk of fire, but more importantly it also kills your battery over time. Lithium ion batteries hate being hot, and burying a battery and some DC to DC power conversation circuitry under an insulator will shorten it's lifespan. Safety hazard or otherwise.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly. All phones have dozens of internal temperature sensors, and charging speeds will slow or stop if the phone is getting top hot, and will resume as soon as temps drop. If you charge your phone under a pillow, all that will happen is that it'll take 2.5 hours to charge instead of 1.</div>

Should I not look for an ashram? How do I properly find a guru? 

I did TM about 10 years ago and we all know the stories behind that. 

I want to avoid the corporatization of spirituality. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You're not going to find anything that someone somewhere hasn't added to "cultwatch" or some site like that because they didn't like it personally.

You're not going to find a successful organization that is not in some way corporatized or has no aspects that resemble a business even if it's a charity on paper.

If you really wanted to it would be possible to find some fault with pretty much any organization or any practice of meditation whatsoever, or even meditation as a concept if that is what you wanted to discredit.

The only practice or "sadhana" **I** would recommend unreservedly would be Goenka Vipassana who offer donation based 10 day introductory courses in a practical technique which many find helpful.

I would also recommend not sticking to the "success story" reviews of Vipassana, but also **looking up any and all negative reviews and especially the YouTube videos** of students who did not like the teaching itself or some other aspect of the courses.

That might help put into perspective how individual interpretations of such things can vary dramatically and let you know if it might be suitable for you personally or not.

The negative reviews are perhaps more enlightening than the positive, not because they are necessarily accurate or even useful as practical pointers, but because it's an opportunity to see how people of certain temperaments see Vipassana.

If anything you see or hear from those negative sources appears to make sense then it's possible Vipassana might not suit you either, but tbh I personally (as a decade plus vipassana meditator) find most of them amusing examples of self-validation (to explain why they left most commonly) and/or mildly disturbing (should never have attended in the state they were in) and sometimes both.

Not everyone finds the courses to be what they thought they were looking for or the circumstances do not suit some temperaments, so there is no guarantee you would find the experience useful or be one of the vast majority who typically complete their full course.

There are of course many good reviews you should also take time to peruse, and I do personally view Vipassana in a very positive light, but also understand why not everyone might.

If you are looking for a guru it's very possible that Vipassana is not what you are looking for at all, even though there is a teacher who explains the practical technique.

&gt;If you are part of a particular school of Meditation/Yoga then please disclose this and keep an open mind 

I have attended many Vipassana courses, and I would recommend more than anything that anyone interested **fully research both positive and negative reviews and feedback** before deciding if it seemed something that might suit them personally or not.

You might not find some of the negative reviews ("I left because they told me what to do!") funny until you complete at least one course and some are not funny at all (only some are), and if you don't complete at least one course you might quite seriously agree with some of the negative reviews (**most are from people who left early**).

Leaving early is not common but some students always do, and on my first course I did not experience what I would call a "breakthrough" until day 10, and that particular personal insight made the entire experience more valuable than I can possibly express.

As for the reviews and opinions of others please bear in mind that YMMV.

Vipassana is a very intensive practice that involves sitting and meditating for most of your waking hours every day of a course, so should not be taken lightly or even considered by anyone not prepared to follow the schedule and rules diligently.

If you want to look into applying read the code of conduct and timetable very carefully and understand before you attend that they are not merely suggestions and you will be meditating for up to 10hrs per day.

And if anyone can get away with (rightfully) calling out Rogan for his soft-ass cushy trump interview, it's burr.

Id love to see him on, hopefully soon.</div>

I've been a a Microsoft contractor, and I’ve seen Copilot getting embedded into everything: my email summaries, KB Articles, CRM pages (Copilot has been asked to guess which data entry fields to put data in, especially great for creating new records /sarcasm off), team notes—you name it. It's been turned on in most of the Microsof products and tools we use!

I don’t know about you, but if I wanted to try and steal the greatest minds from the likes of OpenAI and DeepMind, while also offering them millions of dollars in salary and compensation, it’s really not encouraging that the best he can pitch to them is “join us and we can improve Reels” versus “join us and we can completely revolutionise society as we know it, cure diseases, and push the envelope of science and humanity by building super intelligence”.

The fact he isn’t pitching potential employees the latter, and is instead talking about Reels of all things, shows he lacks serious vision (at least right now).</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">To be clear, the reason why AGI can be a race is because there's an implied level of capability for some projected AGI technology that **enables the party who reaches it to wipe out its competitors**. This need not be militarily even though autonomous drones and automated weapons research are a frightening possibility. Economically destroying a a competitor or using persuasion/wireheading to weaken the productivity of its workers are also threats. Or deploying such vast AGI-enabled efficiencies to benevolently outcompete competitors into irrelevance and multiplying any research and economic lead into an insurmountable advantage by virtue of exponential take-off.

The implicit danger of this possibility is why AGI is a national security priority. The finish line is if and when the lead is so large the leader can cement its dominance for perpetuity.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">To be clear, his whole point is that there’s no such delineating finish line where you have a “before this day we didn’t have AGI, after this day we did”, no definitive moment when someone will have won the “AI race” for good and forever, and that the debate on AGI is a distraction that only interests non-technical folks.

So pretty much the opposite of everything you’re saying here.

Opening the training tooling is open source.

What this is, is a strategy to de-value/increase risk for American AI institutions, that run on investment capital. Making that risky chokes the capital investment (at least, the “smart money”). Dangerous to invest when China might make a competitive model free, right?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You don't have to root for an authoritarian government when Intel Arc exists. The A770 was by far the most affordable 16GB card on the market. The problem is that unlike CUDA literally nothing works on SYCL, and even the stuff that is supposed to work like llama.cpp has random errors (the graph optimization has been broken since it was implemented) so you’re only squeezing out 30-50% of the actual card’s technical performance.

Interestingly enough, the CUDA equivalent for those Chinese Moore Threads GPUs (MUSA) in llama was implemented by a MThreads employee even though even fewer people are interested in that since the performance is on par with Nvidia's 10 series cards. Meanwhile Intel is drowning in whitepapers and has contributed basically nothing to the open source AI community besides releasing a hacky outdated version of TensorFlow and PyTorch.

So yeah, all it takes for a serious competitor to Nvidia is for Intel to stop being Intel. The way AMD CPUs pushed themselves into the server space shows that companies would be willing to drop Nvidia once support matures.</div>

To up the level, have another password to also convey whether they are not safe. Imagine a scenario where they are really kidnapped and by providing that un-safe password, you know that the person is indeed your family member AND also not safe to convey to you that they are in danger.

I generally do not like the use of password but rather on question that only they know the answer to. This means they don't need to remember a specific made-up word. The correct answer can also be no answer. For example, ask what the name of the snake pet when you don't have a snake in the first place. Ask for specific attributes of an items.</div>

You're describing a "code along" session between junior devs and an AI copilot instead of a more senior team member. Sounds great. We've been doing that for years now.

A junior dev can solve simple problems, but cannot independently build and ship an entire project from start to finish no matter how much AI spits at them. They don't know how to do it. That's what the more senior team members are there for who delegated these simple tasks to them. If they can solve more, faster, great. If they themselves can someday become reviewers of individual parts of it before it gets to us, even better. But we cannot actually delegate an entire, real project of any complexity to an AI model. It is incapable of resolving business requirements to a complete product without many iterations and many humans in the loop.</div>

People are *hopeless* and will get the freight train straight to their face.

My advice is, be smarter than them and actually learn how to work with a team of AI agents. Conceptualize what regular developers can't because they are caught in the "stupid next token predictor" mindset. 
Learn advanced red teaming with a side of psychology. Learn team management. How to proficiently orchestrate a hybrid team of humans and AIs with different competencies. Be updated with research and leverage all the knowledge people are too lazy to gather.

In the rest of your time, enjoy life and cultivate any talent it gave you, regardless if it gives you money.</div>

* First prompt: This is ACTUAL Magic. I am a god.
* Prompt 25: JUST FIX THE STUPID BUTTON. AND STOP TELLING ME YOU ALREADY FIXED IT!

I’ve become **obsessed** with this problem. The longer I go, the dumber the AI gets. The harder I try to fix a bug, the more erratic the results. Why does this keep happening?

So, I leveraged my connections (I’m an ex-YC startup founder), talked to veteran Lovable builders, and read a bunch of academic research.

Sometimes I forget myself and a couple of days ago this led me down an hour long adventure trying to get Claude to fix a bug. After about 20 rounds of unsuccessful modifications, it simply disabled the faulty module and everything that calls to it and said something like “this should clear all your debugging errors and allow the program to compile correctly.” - yeah, thanks</div>

Here's a weird trick that works \~75% of the time: "What assumptions about this bug are definitely wrong? Argue against my current approach."

Why this works: LLMs get trapped in 'solution tunnels' where each failed attempt actually reinforces the same broken mental pathway. By forcing it to argue AGAINST its own approach, you break the tunnel and force it into a completely different cognitive space.

The fascinating part? This 'tunnel breaking' pattern works for ANY task where AI gets progressively worse - debugging, writing, analysis, you name it. There's some deep cognitive mechanics happening that nobody talks about.

Try it next time you hit attempt #3 and report back - I'm collecting data on this</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yep, that matches what I've seen from the research.

In one paper I read, they had a second LLM guide the first by encouraging better meta-cognitive behaviors. One of their techniques was to ask a question like:

&gt;The expected output was a list of integers, but your code produced a TypeError. Is the output correct? Answer only 'yes' or 'no'.

Forcing the LLM to say, specifically, that its approach was wrong helped force it to get out of the current possibility branch and explore new ones.</div>

But definitely more context is bad, and sometimes if starting again doesn't work and I'm doing something stand-alone like a component, I'll ask to write a detailed spec, delete the file, and try from scratch.</div>

It's more surprising that the drop goes all the way down to losing 99% of the debugging effectiveness. I'd guess that a human developer would see drops in probability of success, but nothing that steep.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes, this. I guess; given the model has failed on the first try, how much less likely is it to get it on the second try than another attempt at the original prompt? Because the moment you’ve chosen to reprompt, you are by definition selecting on the harder task and from what I can tell there was no attempt to establish a baseline to compare against. I can’t tell here if it’s a multiple prompt issue or a hard-task issue</div>

It’s not a consumer product, and, like you, I don’t think it’s accurate to say “this is doing the laundry”. It’s a shame that humanoids get so overhyped. The actual progress we’re making is amazing, but it totally pales in comparison to the progress posts like this imply we are making</div>

I don’t even know if this is actually the robot doing it vs some guy piloting it for $2/hour. 

If all it’s doing is moving laundry in and out the machine then it’s practically useless. That’s literally the easiest and fastest part of the entire process. We are missing the other 90% of the “washing the laundry” process which is far more involved.

I’ll do the soy facing when it’s doing all of it while I’m at work.</div>

Lawrence Stroll is NOT selling the team just that the Aston Martin car brand is selling it's stake in the F1 team because the car business is failing. The team is a completely seperate legal and corporate entity. That thing is raising in value like crazy.

"It won’t make a huge difference to the race division as the ‘parent’ company actually only owned 4.6% of the sporting arm, but the $146 million sale will raise will be a welcome cash injection for the car business, which continues to struggle financially."</div>

so that they can lose interest in like 5 years and shut down the team? Honda isn't known for commitment to F1.

They almost killed the team that is currently knowns as Mercedes.</div>
