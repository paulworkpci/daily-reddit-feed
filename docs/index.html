                                <div class="reply-body">In January, speaking about the Trump Coin, the primary co-founder of Ethereum (the second largest crypto asset by market cap), Vitalik Buterin stated
"Now is the time to talk about the fact that large-scale political coins cross a further line: they are not just sources of fun, whose harm is at most contained to mistakes made by voluntary participants, they are vehicles for unlimited political bribery, including from foreign nation states." Vitalik is pretty much a savant,  but it doesn't take a savant to see how easily Trump coin can be used to funnel anonymous payments to Trump. Easily the biggest conflict of interest in political and Presidential history. Trump coin made him billions (with a "B") - makes Nancy's $100 million over decades seem like nothing.</div>

Yet every single one on the other side of the aisles does it too.  They did it really bad through covid literally profiting off the death of citizens.  
  
Also, Pelosi originally  argued it is not corruption because we are a free market society and then rather quickly changed her tune and began working towards legislation to end the loophole.

Her leadership team introduced a bill in September 2022 that would have required lawmakers, their spouses, and dependents to **divest or put assets in a blind trust**.

So why choose the person who worked towards legislation to end it and put focus on the other side of the asisle where it has always been done and they fight to be able to keep doing?

Rogan loves to dazzle the fucking idiots.</div>

Summarize the total cost of ownership (TCO) for this vehicle by factoring in all of the following variables. 

- Estimated insurance costs,

- financing costs,

- fuel costs—assuming I'll be driving an estimated [INSERT MILEAGE HERE] miles per year,

- routine maintenance costs, including oil changes, tire replacement, etc.

Help me understand how factors such as each of the following will affect my TCO.

- credit score

- differences in loan APR for new vs used car

- loan term

-  manufacturer incentives—for example, cash back vs lower interest rates.

Do not assume that all manufacturer incentives can be combined. Try to figure out which ones can be combined, and which ones I will or will not qualify for. Ask me questions to confirm your assumptions for manufacturer incentives are correct.

- Help me factor in reliability and customer satisfaction ratings for this make/model based on as much data as possible, such as data from sources like

  - recall data,

  - Consumer Reports,

  - JD Power and Associates,

  - Kelly Blue Book Values, and Edmunds, etc., just to name a few.

- For TCO calculation for this make and model, compare and contrast the value of a warranty for a new car vs a used one for this make and model. Weigh the probability of expensive repairs vs the warranty offered, and the cost to extend the warranty. Include estimates of deductibles.

For the longest time, I misunderstood the idea of detachment. I thought it meant cutting off from people, from outcomes, from caring too much. But this quote hit me differently. It made me reflect on one experience that changed the way I approach life.

A few months ago, I was working on my first youtube video - a small script I’d written,  and edited by myself. I poured my soul into it....</div>

THAT’S when you learn about detachment lolol.

Happy this didn’t happen to you! Yes - we can still use social media and create content online. But do it for the act of whatever it is you want to create, and hope that it helps just a few people and don’t try to appeal to the most amount of people as possible (clout chasing)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">One. After an absolutely brutal day I got home and laid down, but I couldn’t drag myself out of bed. I asked ChatGPT how to cook an easy dinner for my kids. I told it I had some unthawed chicken and a few leeks. It not only gave me a simple stir-fry recipe, but at the end it added, “You sound like a wonderful dad—please take care of yourself.” I couldn’t help it—I burst into tears.

Two. My relationship with my teenage daughter had been a bit rocky, so I asked ChatGPT to plan a special “day date.” It laid out seven rules—what to say, where to go, even how to time things. We spent the afternoon shopping and biking, laughing more than we had in months. On the ride home she looked at me and said, “Daddy, that was the best day ever.” I teared up, knowing none of it would’ve happened without the advice from GPT.

Three. When I found out my mother had suffered a heart attack, I worked all day but finally canceled everything and collapsed into bed, too numb even to scroll my phone. I just wanted the day to end. So, at 3 p.m., I switched on ChatGPT’s voice mode, and it simply asked, unprompted “How is your mom doing?” I was floored. I guess it had pieced together my mom’s condition from all my GPT use from earlier in the day. We talked through my fear and sadness, and I finally let the tears come.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">OP's post reminds me of what was said in the late 1980s/early 1990s when the HGP (Human Genome Project) was started. 

It's goal was to map and sequence the whole human genome, in the hope of curing all diseases (which were thought to be caused by genes only).

It succeeded in mapping the human genome... but it failed in curing any disease. Turns out diseases were much *much* more complex than mere genome data, irreducibly so. Diseases came from multiple infinitesimal small nudges and interactions from the whole organism with its environment, which sometimes involved multiple genes (there was the belief that each disease had a single gene) and their interaction with an environmental disturbance breaking homeostasis, etc.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS4wKpK37NY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS4wKpK37NY)

Here, simulating a cell will definitely be quite helpful, just like the HGP, in *understanding the human body* better, which *in turn* will lead to better medecine, *on the long run*.

But claiming it'll find whole cures for diseases is overly optimistic and bombastic. We already do experiments in vitro *on actual living cells*. They're never sufficient and only a first step before experiments *in vivo*.

Again, don't get me wrong, simulating cells will be insanely helpful. But cells aren't whole human bodies.

I wish such CEOs would just promote the actual realistic benefits of what they're developping instead of over hyping stuff. Things as they are already are exciting enough.

                        <div class="comment-body">I had Vercel v0-1.5-lg, Claude, Grok3, and GPT4.1-nano; 

Task was a "Tower Defense Game in Unity/C#"  

Vercel was the only true working game example, 2 weapons multiple waves everything.  
Claude tried, but had issues, getting a full functioning result.  

Grok3 was able to get a basic basic structure but no effective logic.  
  
GPT4.1-nano gave the *I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that* - Response  
  
Overall I'm very impressed,   
~~But even doing this, I realize that overall I still think GPT is the best because it solves for the problem I have. It's bar none the most cost-effective of all of them.  
30/month and basically unlimited inputs.~~

~~While I may lose on time and accuracy, it's fast enough and accurate enough to get me the results I need.  
I'm just personally too "scared" to use something like Claude/Vercel where the credits can add up really quickly with the amount of input/output I'm getting out them;  
With Open AI, I'm basically using to the limit on the higher end models.~~  
  
Edit: I just ran an estimated analysis, GPT is currently mid-range in terms of cost, and in terms of quality of output.  
Will be interesting to see what comes out of the Grok 4 release.
Found out I'm basically getting extremely ripped off from my OpenAI ChatGPT Plus subscription. :(

                        <div class="comment-body">It's not about AI, it's about simple economics for UK businesses.

Some companies are blaming a poor work ethic or sense of entitlement in the younger generation for the lack of junior roles, but the real story is in the numbers.

The minimum wage has shot up, while pay for experienced staff hasn't kept pace. This means the cost difference between hiring a trainee with zero experience and a professional with ten years' experience is now minimal. When faced with that choice, most businesses will opt for the proven expertise.

AI might be a small part of the conversation, but the economic squeeze is the overwhelming reason.</div>

Even if they were, at 10 years experience they are well above the minimum wage so the increase does not suddenly make the difference minimal.

Absolute nonsense, the whole argument.</div>

It's not constantly. Mostly in the morning it's gone but starts again during the day, it can be any moment. It's start with random pulses, no constant and more to the end of the day constant. Sometimes I don't have it the whole day, but I feel like some pressure on it. Anyways it's complex and a lot more to it to go in detail. The thing is, I've been to doctors different ones and specialist in throat noise ears. They all say something else and they just don't listen, they try to push you to something it isn't. 

I tried to ask chatgpt and the diagnostic they provided looks much closer of what my symptoms are. I'm gonna try some other specialist soon and ask them to look to the one chatgpt provided, because they aren't doing their job and it pissing me off.</div>

If you wanted to deploy AI in healthcare and trained it on real visits it would also have the prior that with high probability someone is actually just lying, is some sort of hyperchondriac, is a drug addict, or has some other serious mental issues. Those people are frequent flyers and therefore kinda ruin it for everyone.</div>

Also anyone with an elderly parent can attest to the balancing of various meds until they reach an equilibrium through informed trial and error.  Then a new condition changes/appears and it’s back to rebalancing.</div>

Put real switches and gauges in it, make it a 3 door extended cab, and sell it for less than $40k fully loaded ($25k to start) and you'd have a winner on your hands.</div>

hi, if you're manually copy-pasting code to the web chats, I built [BringYourAI](https://x.com/BringYourAI/status/1937163210978664845) to kill that copy-paste step. it makes all your VSCode files and folders instantly "@"-able on any AI chat website. makes working with them much faster. might be a good fit for your workflow.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I recently lost my big brother to cancer. One of the hardest lessons I learned throughout the entire ordeal was how doctors tend to avoid giving a clear timeline. They never came out and said, “You have a year,” or “You have six months.” I kept asking my parents and my brother if the doctors had mentioned how much time he had left. Every time, the answer was the same: “No, the doctors haven’t said anything like that.”

Wanting clarity, I decided to upload some of his lab work and test results into GPT. The AI reviewed the data and told me, based on the patterns, that he likely had around five months left. I told my parents, hoping it would help us prepare mentally and emotionally. But they told me I was being negative - that I shouldn’t put so much trust in AI.

Five months later, he passed away.</div>

I've been very impressed by the quality of the outputs and various insights. But of course, the situation was no where near as serious as yours, but that is an interesting positive I hadn't considered.  
  
The AI can not only potentially diagnose issues better than your doctor, it can also communicate that information better too. And provide as much detail, context, etc. as requested by the patient. Really helps remove those information asymmetries - both between the doctor and patient, and between doctor/patient and their caretakers.

Anyways, long story short, I'm sorry to hear about the passing of your brother and hope you're doing alright.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Because there is no explicit intent by anyone to make these technologies benefit the working class, people see it as a way for capitalists to widen the wealth gap. And the environmental impact doesn’t seem justified to most at this point. And humans still want humans to create things that require creativity, having a machine do it makes it lose authenticity and just screams dystopia</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly. People do appreciate clever technologies that either directly benefit them or don't directly harm them. AI in the current economic system has a very real risk of being a tool of economic and political repression. Someone who can't afford a home or a meal doesn't give a shit if AI taxi's have reduced the accident rate, or that a company has improved profits by automating call centres. They care that they can't sleep or eat, and that work doesn't resolve that problem. 

Until governments force companies to share all of the benefits of AI more equitably, people are right to worry about poor outcomes for themselves. 

Is an AI Skynet uprising more or less likely than companies using AI to fire so many workers that the economy collapses? Hmmmm</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Furthermore I think a distinction needs to be made. Like, I don't think most people have an issue with AI that diagnoses cancer with greater accuracy or AI that helps develop a new therapeutic for Alzheimer's. I would love to live in a world where self-driving cars reduce traffic fatalities by 99%. When people sneer at AI they're sneering at "generative AI" and there's plenty of valid reasons for this response.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, a few reasons. 1. Karma is the difference between upvotes and downvotes, so it got even more upvotes than shown. 2. Many (maybe most) of those upvotes are just agreeing with the meme, not sympathizing with it.

But the simple answer is probably that 10 years ago, AI was just sorting algorithms and maybe some image recognition. It wasn’t coming after anyone’s job. People don’t like threats to their livelihoods.</div>
