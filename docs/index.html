Or hardware manufacturers face some sort of a crisis so all the ai companies face a shortage blocking their progress. Or for example there is a significant sun flare that hits earth and fries majority of electronics, rendering all ai infrastructure useless. Hippies always claim you should just let everything go, and then they complain how things get bad for them. 

There is always something to prepare for, the least you can do is invest in your and your family health, not to mention learning new skills that will help you in your daily life, like cooking or fixing stuff around the house. If you want to prepare for something hypothetical that nobody understands, just do yourself a favor and become the best version of yourself, that's the best scenario you can follow.</div>

edit: whether UBI comes or not isn’t the point. the point is that AGI may make you unemployable and increase wealth inequality, which means saving money or acquiring property might be a good idea</div>

Buying rural land might be a good way to prepare.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">when we will achieve a post-scarcity economy, nature, space, peace won't be that scarce aswell

people might believe that there not enough place for everyone on Earth but it's a mistake to believe so as most of the space used mainly come from agriculture then natural reserve and only after that, urban environment, when we will achieve infinite labour+energy we will make most of our foods in hydroponic tower and laboratory, we will basically industrialize foods without any need of nature anymore

nature space will likely greatly increase and that include savage animal in their natural habitat, if post-AI society allow us to build every basic infrastructure any metropolis have but for the countryway then we will likely witness a de-urbanization movement with villages and smaller city becoming far more common as there won't be the burden of jobs or lack of doctor in such scenario 

i'll argue that the only good thing to prepare today is putting as much money you can in your bank account so the transition be as peacefull it's possible when everyone become jobless and prepare a few month of water and food reserve for your family in case of civil unrest in a worst case scenario - building up this reserve take a lot of time unless you're wealthy, better start as soon you can afford</div>

People even report to have gained mystical powers and the ability to astral travel by merely fixating the attention on the breath over an extended period of time. I'm not doubting the legitima...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">One of the main causes for suffering is our belief of being separate entities. And this illusory separate entity is actually a 'doing' of the mind that requires unconscious attention and clinging.

When the mind is nurturing the attention into some stable object like the breath, in this same movement it's by definition *not* fabricating this usual suffering self *as much*. It's not an on/off switch but a spectrum: the deeper we go into the meditation, the less self and world are fabricated at all and the more freedom and non-separation we feel.

Hope this makes sense, let me know if you have follow up questions</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Breathing is pretty amazing when you break it down. In addition to the effects it has on our nervous system, we can also become aware that our breath connects us to everything: the plants that produce the oxygen we breath, the water that plants require to grow, the clouds which filter our water, the sky which holds these clouds, a vast Earth of which the sky, the oceans, all plants, animals, and minerals belong to. Returning our attention to our breath creates the opportunity to free ourselves from the separate self, the ego, and reconnect with a profound sense of interbeing, the awareness that we are all interconnected by the cosmic spirit of everything.


It’s also your own anchor to life. To put it simply, when you stop breathing, you die.</div>

That might not sound impressive, but this record had stood for FIFTY-SIX YEARS.

Let me put this in perspective:

* Matrix multiplication is literally one of the most fundamental operations in computing - it's used in everything from graphics rendering to neural networks to scientific simulations
* Strassen's...</div>

The difference is that the AlphaTensor improvement used binary and only worked on a limited set of numbers.

Except for all the dozens of improvements to it that have been discovered since then?  This is only true if you are concentrating specifically on the number of scalar multiplications for multiplying a small matrix and ignore improvements in the number of addition/subtraction operations as well as larger asymptotic complexity which has steadily improved over the last 60 years.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational\_complexity\_of\_matrix\_multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_matrix_multiplication)

It's a great result and we should be excited, but you don't need to lie to make mathematicians look bad for some reason.</div>

Seeing as how this equates to hundreds of millions of dollars in savings, I understand that I was wrong before.

FURTHER, these AlphaEvolve discoveries were made over a year ago, so who knows what Deepmind is working on now? Announcements like these def make me think we are on an exponential path towards AGI in the next several years.</div>

They mentioned using this research to improve various parts of their work over the past year, so we can be sure that it has been around for a while already.

It seems like the cycle for research at certain labs is to develop something internally, benefit off of it for x amou...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">They released a podcast today with a lab that got prerelease access to the paper and had time to mull it over. It’s pleasant, but be aware it’s an hour long.

They said the next generation was cooking and would be ready “in the coming months”. It’s not unusual for Google to do a one-two punch like this, and honestly, I don’t believe this is the only radical thing they have coming down the pipes.

There’s a patent they applied for, for composability in attaching neural networks to each other without catastropic forgetting, and the same patent, a technique to add new layers inside a neural network without experiencing catastrophic forgetting. Kind of a dream of composability there. 

If you need spare capacity, just add layers, you don’t have to retrain from scratch! Need to graft a dog identifying network to a cat identifying network? Okay. 👀 (*Disclaimer: I have no idea exactly what is meant by composable here, this is me being a bit snarky*)

Also, whatever they’ve done with large context windows is radical. They may only have a one million token context window, but it’s flawless compared to everyone else’s. There’s something neat going on there too.

Good writers have always had to deal with accusations of using outside resources--before there was AI, I had a teacher suggest my 100% original essay was straight plagiarized from an encyclopedia resource because it was too well written. I had to show her the encyclopedia articles myself, that none of them used language similar to mine. It sucks being accused, and now everyone is hyper-suspicious and throwing around accusations.</div>

I plagiarized the the fuck out of that paper, basically copying word-for-word what was written in D&amp;D manuals.  The teacher was an older lady who probably didn't even know what D&amp;D was.  She thought I was amazing, gave me a 100, and made a big deal about it in front of class.

Not really sure what this contributes to the conversation besides your post reminding me of it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Back in 2017 or so I actually managed to get enough comment karma or whatever to post an answer to a question there. Felt like a major accomplishment at the time, because Stack Overflow did not have the real answer but it was hard to post one and mods claimed it was solved. It drives me crazy how often you look up a topic and some moderator has responded "Closed as already answered" and yet it's not answered.

Wikipedia used to be similar with the overzealous moderation. I had multiple articles removed wayyy back in the day (like 2005-2006) by the power moderators as "redundant" and pointless and now there are gigantic articles about the topic... and Mr. Power Moderator gets to take the credit for writing them. We're talking topics like "Barred Spiral Galaxy" and stuff like that, and I went through and added photos from astronomy papers and everything. Wikipedia super-users quite literally stole authorship from authors and young scientists for years, and then put the credit on their own resumes.

I love free resources like Wikipedia, but it's why I'm immediately skeptical of people celebrated for "decades of contributions." It's easy to be a huge contributor if you block out everyone else  and take credit for yourself.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The problem with Stack Overflow has always been that they gave moderation powers to those who are good at answering questions (i.e. those that got points). Unfortunately, but to no ones surprise really, the skills to be good at answering technical questions (an eye for detail; being nitpicky etc.) have zero overlap with those which make a good moderator. I'd even go so far and say that often people who are good at answering technical questions are the *worst* moderators.


For a while people still were willing to suffer the abuse of the petty tyrants, but this lead to death spiral where less people were willing to put up with this, which means less questions got answered, which made the site less useful and so on.

In a way it's the same with Wikipedia, which also suffers from a lack of people willing to put up with petty tyrants reverting every edit and forcing you to fight weeks to month of discussions through. And then they wonder why they have less and less people making edits.</div>

Then make sure I read the FAQ and rules, 1 hour later finally find the moral fortitude to post. Get one bot answer, 2 troll answers saying I'm poor af and not serious, then someone answering without having read my question. I'm going to miss this soooo much.

Turned off the alarms and went back to sleep. Definitely a lesson for the future though.</div>

The other night the song “Back to Paradise” by 38 Special and the theme to Revenge of the Nerds 2 popped into my head randomly.  I don’t like that movie and was never a huge fan of the song.   

Anyways it’s stuck in my head so I pull up YT, **start searching for “Take me back to Paradise” because I had the title wrong in my head**.  I get to “Take Me” and that’s the first thing that pops up - the video of them playing “Back to Paradise” with Revenge of the Nerds 2 scenes interspersed within.   

So it read what I had in mind and the search results found it instantly even though I started the wrong title.   

I then tried searching for a video I knew I watched recently and had to type nearly the whole thing in (correctly) before the right result came up, so it shouldn’t have been brought back from a former search (though I don’t think I ever searched for it before).

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s no surprise that ITT nobody is discussing why they recommend fasting for cancer treatment and prevention. I said this in a separate comment but it was buried so I’ll say it again here:

There’s loads of evidence that fasting has immense benefits to your health. Specifically, in treating and preventing cancer it reduces insulin-like growth factor which reduces the risk of uncontrolled cell division. It enhances autophagy which allows the body to clean up cancerous cells. It reduces inflammation which is a key driver of most cancers. It reprograms your metabolism by reducing insulin and glucose levels which can starve cancerous cells. It enhances DNA repair preventing cancerous mutations. And it boosts your immune system fortifying your body against cancerous cells. Perhaps we should be focusing on educating people on how to prevent cancer because clearly we haven’t discovered anything close to a cure.

&gt; *The firehose of falsehood, also known as firehosing, is a propaganda technique in which a large number of messages are broadcast rapidly, repetitively, and continuously over multiple channels (like news and social media) without regard for truth or consistency. An outgrowth of Soviet propaganda techniques, the firehose of falsehood is a contemporary model for Russian propaganda under Russian President Vladimir Putin.*

&gt; *The Russian government… continued to use it as part of its interference in the 2016 United States elections, largely aided by the repetition of Russian falsehoods by Donald Trump, who has made constant lying a key part of his communication strategy. Politicians, governments, and movements in other countries have since adopted the use of the same tactics.*

Joe Rogan and his intellectual dark web (fucking *criiiinge*) buddies are useful idiots for this very purpose, undermining truth to allow for fascists to set their own narratives.</div>

Go to any Ferrari Challenge Race, Mclaren/Aston/Lambo hosted events by dealers or corporate. 99% of the room will be Iphone users. Even when Mclaren released a phone with Oneplus I never saw a single Mclaren owner with one. I had one and solely used it as a business phone just for calls.</div>

A large appeal to me was seeing the design language of different OEM gauge clusters and each one gave the car a distinct personality. Now every gauge cluster will be aligned to Apples design language. The "customization" features they've demoed so far seem to amount to multiple styles of the same sans serif minimalist void. </div>

Honestly most of these screens have ruined gauge clusters for me already. I think the OG Audi virtual cockpit is nice (biased) and Porsche is doing well, but most of glass dashes I see in “normal” cars look like cheap garbage with a UI designed by a middle schooler. </div>

Even if you try tools/techniques to catch it there's still a decent chance some dust will spill.

Or have a second LLM instance check the responses for alignment with your script first, and discard and regenerate whenever it doesn't.
