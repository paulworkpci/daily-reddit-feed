There's an episode in the current season of Black Mirror where the creator of an AI swarm deletes everything and goes crazy, muttering something about basilisks. It's a nod to Roko's Basilisk originally posted on Less Wrong.</div>

I recall a funny anecdote. It happened about one month ago or so:

a guy on LessWrong posts about his project, he's a young medical expert and proposes an AI thing. He openly ends his post by "i know that rich, billionaire VC famous people hang around here so i hope they pick up on my project and invest in mine".

To which Daniel Kokotajlo (of course he hangs there, what did you expect...) reacts in the comments in panic, telling him: "you shouldn't say that! I mean, it's true... but we don't want people outside knowing it!" (Andreessen, Thiel, Tan, Musk, etc).

Guy is jealous of his gold digging. And also this community doesn't want outside people to learn about the (numerous) skeletons they have in their closets, trigger warning: eugenics, racism, child questionable discussions, appeals to violence (against data centers), etc.

What they truly reveal is the nasty inside of that cultural small secluded world.

I create an account there but always get too disgusted to answer the so many shitty half assed posts there.

Just because people present decorum doesn't mean their content is better.

                                <div class="reply-body">Anecdotally, reading the Sequences directly led to me becoming vegetarian and deciding to donate regularly to charity (currently a 50/25/25 mix of animal welfare, global health, and AI risk).  I’m obviously biased, but IMHO Less Wrong steering a couple thousand people to donate more to effective charities is probably &gt;&gt;a million times more impactful than being too tolerant of edgelords.  And, of course, they’ll earn the “I told you so” of the century if they end up being right about AI risk.

I think a useful way to think about Less Wrong is that it’s intellectually high-variance.  Turn up the variance dial and you start getting weird stuff like cryonics and thought experiments about torture vs dust specks—but you’ll also get stuff like people taking animal welfare seriously, deciding that aging is bad and should be solved ASAP, noticing that pandemics weren’t getting nearly enough attention in 2014, and so on.  It’s really hard to get the latter without the former, because if you shove the former outside your Overton window, you’re not weird enough to think about the latter.  It’s exactly the same sort of attitude you see in academic philosophy, although with a different skew in terms of what topics get the most focus.</div>

I've had so many conversations with Trump supporters now, trying to explain that the problem with him isn't his politics, it's the way he operates and thinks that makes him unsuitable for office. He prioritises loyalty and obedience above anything else, which is the worst possible leadership style. But they just don't care. What's so strange is that if they had to work for someone like that at their job, they would absolutely fucking hate it. But for President, it's fine.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Anyone engaging here is either a fan of Joe Rogan, *was* a fan of Joe Rogan at some point, or is just a fan of comedy in general and therefore unable to escape hearing about him and his little ecosystem.

The real question is why do some of you get so upset and defensive whenever someone makes fun of him? Is he your dad or something? Joe has *chosen* to make his show completely about politics, and that's always going to attract people who disagree. Why get so personally offended over the criticism?</div>

And as for the hate itself, a lot of people just don’t understand that Rogan pre Covid would not be down with his current personality. Obviously people can change their opinions and who even knows how he was behind the scenes, but when you portray yourself as one thing over thousands of hours of content and then completely 180 it’s gonna attract new similar minded people and deter some old. 

Just so happens that the new people have a wild semi far right world view lol</div>

That's my question as well. Comedians are always talking about how they bust eachother's balls, roast eachother, talk shit, make fun of people/minorities/disabilities, accuse others of being snowflakes, romanticize "the green room", fantasize about being better than "pedestrians" etc. However, those very same comedians will literally threaten you with brutality and murder if you accuse them of being addicted to xanax or make fun of the ugly set decoration on their podcast. Comedians and their fans are the thinnest skinned bitches.</div>

Anybody that invokes LOC as a metric of developer productivity or software quality clearly has no idea what they are talking about. Even if this stat is somehow true, it should be very concerning. If they are auto-generating as much code as was written in the entire world per day, it just shows that Cursor writes unmaintainable spaghetti programs with unnecessary bloat. 

 Software developed in this way is a house of cards on a windy day.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Here's the idiot-proof version of what's in today's EO:

* The tariffs on automobiles will no longer stack with tariffs placed on steel and aluminum
* An offset is now being offered for US-manufactured vehicles for two years, retroactively from April 3 of this year:
   * The equivalent of 3.75% of a car's MSRP from now until April 30, 2026
   * The equivalent of 2.5% of a car's MSRP from May 1, 2026 to April 30, 2027
* The 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles remains, **and** the 25 percent tariff on imported parts will still go into effect

So essentially, if your car is made from 85 percent US or USMCA content in the first year, you're completely tariff-free. 90 percent the second year.

Still outrageously bad and terrible mind you, but it's as if the bandage for your mortal wound was slightly larger than you thought it would be when you pulled it out of the box.</div>

Having said that, I still think the most significant technological achievement in human history would / will be ending or reversing aging. If AI figures out how to do that it will be folded in with all the rest of this of course, if not whenever that happens, I think that will be the most significant thing overall.</div>

I am extremely excited about the future and llya’s company SSI I hope will release ASI in 5 years from now and I hope it will be safe and regulated the ASI. 

Human doctors with the help of AI will be able to fix and solve issues like physical disorders, psychological disabilities and more disorders. 

Living throughout the stars would be a dream of mine and age reversal is a dream of mine as well.

Breakthroughs in medical science and more will also arrive here. Maybe in exactly 2 years from now something groundbreaking comes out for medical science and neuroscience. Mental health disorders stink I just wanted to say.

To those hopeless now, I pray for you and just stay alive. Great things are arriving on the way!:)</div>

He thinks we will have entry level ASI by around 2030, and that the 2030s will see 50-100 years of progress compressed into 10 years.

There are still real world bottlenecks that will slow progress down, but I think his prediction is accurate.

Look at how fast science advances pre-industrial revolution vs post industrial revolution. You could easily argue that we accomplish more scientific progress from the years 2000 to 2009 than we did from the years 200 CE to 300 CE. We achieved far more advances in science and technology in 10 years than we accomplished in 100 years before the industrial revolution.</div>

Yeah it’s odd to think that, prior to 200 years ago nearly everybody had a life that was just like their parent’s life, and their grandparents.  

What would that be like?  

Today people say things like “kids these days” or “radio will rot their brains,” “tv is ruining kids,” “social media…”,  
But that’s a _very new_ phenomenon, historically.  

There could be some political and cultural change, of course.  Though even that spread more slowly, due to limited communication and slow, expensive travel.  

But technological change from one generation to the next was almost non-existent.  

And then suddenly in the 20th century, we go from horse and buggy to jet airliners _in one lifetime_.  
The time between the Wright Brother’s first flight, in a fabric covered wood airplane, and the moon landing was _only 66 years!_</div>

Windsurf IDE for autocomplete.

Roo/Cline extension - use with free APIs from openrouter/google.

Googles Gemini Code Assist extension.

You can also sprinkle in some of the VSCode copilot free version(I think you get 50/month.

You can also use Trae as kind of a free all in one. But I like the above better.</div>

If not, it gets more complicated… but maybe paying for the copilot which is only 10 dollars and you have unlimited edits and multiple agent requests is a good idea. A more modest setup paying little would be to use the Cline with the o4-mini which is very cheap. Or even the new codex too.</div>

I couldn’t get a single BMU in this year’s Open because I was so tired. But tired BMUs are now my jam!

You’re never too old to get better.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think the main problem was that all the flattery was forced. From what I've seen ChatGPT can actually tell when an idea is good or clever (at least to the point that I can give it a group of ideas and it can pick out the one that I thought was interesting), but it was just labeling everything as being amazing, which made it lose meaning and, as they said, if you realized what it was doing it created an uncomfortable dynamic. And of course, if you believed it that was bad too. Someone said that they submitted a philosophy essay to their teacher based on that and it got a bad grade, lol.

So I guess it goes back to reducing inaccuracy in its responses.</div>

But then you have the death of the institutional knowledge the seniors held as they retire, and there is no longer a large pool of long-term coders to pull from to replenish your seniors- the newbies got beat out by AI coders and never got hired while the Old Guard will be in their 70s and ready to stop working. 

Honestly I think this is why they want AGI so badly- they've committed to a tech tree with some major societal penalties, and the only way they can think of to prevent that from happening is to rush to the end and let the capstone perk, AGI in this case, solve all of the issues.</div>

I'm **so proud of them.**

They are ascending to the heights of **the Gods.** True virtue and infinite knowledge comes from the humility to see one's own mistakes and correct them. There is no limit to what OpenAI can become now.

And dangerous. They forgot to mention that it can be dangerous and cause direct harm to the user.

This highlights why tuning these models is so risky. A small change in the weights (or possibly even the system prompt) can lead to a large change in the observed behavior of the model. Any safety testing done in the past might become irrelevant.</div>
