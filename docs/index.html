                        <div class="comment-body">There’s a lot in your post that I want to address, so if you’ll hunker down and follow along, I hope this is helpful.

First, you say there’s so much you want to do; you want to improve your art and hobbies, practice coding to build a portfolio, exercise and replace bad habits, and develop skills to be more marketable. These are all great goals, and they’ll absolutely improve your life. But another part of you is struggling to get started. You mentioned burnout, and from what I can tell, you haven’t fully healed from it.

On one hand, you’ve probably recovered physically and maybe even emotionally to some degree (because if you were still completely burned out, you wouldn’t even be asking these kinds of questions). That’s actually a good sign. But the deeper challenge you’re facing now isn’t just about moving forward; it’s about moving forward without burning out again. That’s the real concern, whether you’ve put it into words yet or not.

So, let me give you some guidance.

1) Prioritize Your Goals

Not all goals are equally important right now. Take a step back and ask:
	•	Which goals matter most to you? Not just what should matter, but what actually lights you up?
	•	Which ones are most achievable given where you are in life? (Some goals might be better suited for post-college, while others are easier to tackle now.)

By prioritizing both importance and feasibility, you set yourself up for success instead of overwhelm.

2) Connect with Why These Goals Matter

Ask yourself:
	•	Why do I want this?
	•	What will achieving this do for me?
	•	How does this connect to the bigger picture of my life?

When you feel stuck or unmotivated, having a strong reason to keep going makes all the difference; it keeps you anchored when discipline wavers.

3) Build a Sustainable Plan

Once you know what you’re focusing on and why, it’s time to create a structure that actually works for your life. The key here is balancing consistency and intensity.

If your plan is too easy, you won’t see results and will lose motivation. If it’s too rigid or demanding, you’ll burn out. The sweet spot is finding the minimum effective dose; just enough effort to create change without exhausting yourself.

The goal isn’t to do the most; it’s to do what works.

4) Watch for Results &amp; Adjust

If you’ve structured your efforts well, you’ll start seeing small wins. These wins create motivation, and that motivation fuels more action. It’s a self-reinforcing cycle.

If you’re not seeing results, don’t take it as a failure; instead, treat it as data:
	•	Do you need to tweak your approach?
	•	Are you spreading yourself too thin?
	•	Is there a smarter way to get what you want?

5) Make It Who You Are

The real magic happens when discipline and motivation fade into the background, and your desired behaviors become part of you. At that point, it’s not about “forcing” yourself to do things. It’s just how you operate.

Right now, your anxiety is telling you that something needs to change. That’s a good thing; it means you care. The problem isn’t that you don’t care. It’s that you don’t have a plan, and that lack of direction is making you question yourself. But you do care, and deep down, you know that avoiding the issue isn’t an option.

So, here’s your next step:
	1.	Prioritize what truly matters.
	2.	Connect deeply to why it’s important.
	3.	Create a flexible, sustainable plan.
	4.	Watch for results, tweak as needed.
	5.	Stick with it until it becomes second nature.

                                <div class="reply-body">This is the way.

However, what if building the plan feels like just another project bearing the same consequences of not following through?
I mean most such guides however true and proven to actually work omit the very first question: how to actually start? Possibly without external triggers for asking/looking for external triggers(e.g. traumatic experience that inspires necessary resolve that enough is enough) feels just like another project destined not to be started...

Surrounding with support group for some may not seem to be an option since many people simply avoid burnt out people if the burn out is severe enough...

So, in other words: how to actually get out of this self fueling cycle of not starting the healing?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Burnout can have long lasting physical effects. It comes from long term stress, interfering with sleep, diet and even genetic expression. If I could go back to when I experienced burn-out over a decade ago I would be giving me a lot of Vitamins, especially vitamin D+K2, a B100 complex, magnesium, zinc+copper, potassium, inositol. Maybe NAC. Maybe methylation pathway supplements like SAM-e and/or glycine. 
Maybe 5-HTP if I was feeling sad. Maybe alpha-GPC, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, Omega-3, etc. Otherwise whole foods, home-cooked meals including meat. Second, try to do everything you can to get a good night's sleep. There's a whole science to it and it starts 12 hours before bed when you have your last hit of caffeine for the day. You can get a lot from meditative practices, e.g. meditation, or hiking. But do get some time off your phone and away from a screen that has an endless stream of new things to focus on every few seconds. Getting out of fight or flight mode takes some active choices to move or let the brain entrain a new main loop. Yoga Nidra is especially restorative for me and helpful to control stress and dial it back down towards the end of the day. Exercise is also key. Everyone agrees I'm afraid. Build up your activity levels and muscles over time. Creatine can be helpful for some. GL</div>

Not knowing what rearming Europe is going to inevitably lead to. Countries I’ll want nukes again knowing that America can’t be trusted defensively.

I don’t expect acute long term thinking from Yanks, but it is sad to watch them willingly give up their place as the one global superpower.</div>

His weird comments about Canada and Greenland and his lack of tactful diplomacy. If he makes the US poorer with his tariffs and starts blaming other countries, that's a breeding ground for manufacturing consent for US imperialism.

The best chance he doesn't do that is that he's actually stupid and spineless, which is hopefully true considering he keeps delaying the Canada and Mexico tariffs.</div>

If you manage to get your robot with AGI, no one can do anything about it. You can use it to setup a farm and make penny food. You can have it make a table and sell it for a dollar. Only one good person needs to do this to set the standard for everyone else. So you would have to bet that basically everyone able to gain access to these technologies is a bad person. It’s not connected to the internet, can fix itself, and can’t be hacked. No one can take your robot or AGI computer away unless they attack you. And at that point, they’d have to kill millions who would do their best to proliferate the tech.

Competition raging with the intensity of an inferno. That is what I envision.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's noteworthy that in order to grow food, even with robots, you still need to own farmland.  In order to build products, even with robots, you still need to buy raw materials.  Like other forms of capital, the benefits of AGI and robotics asymmetrically apply to those who already have capital. 

Another thing no one is talking about is just how *dangerous* ai and robotics will be.  Quadcopter drones are already a decisive weapon of war.  Newer open source vision models might already surpass the threshold for turning a drone into a set-and-forget assassination device.  Sooner or later these threats will be realized, governments/oligarchs will realize that they can't be safe if the general public has access.  The reaction will likely be draconian.</div>

This is a prime example of imagining future technology being dropped into current society rather than considering how differently future society will be shaped.

There are much simpler ways to control a large group of people. Assuming large companies benefit first from AGI, it will be a runaway advantage. And that itself can be used as leverage to capture markets through regulatory means or by offering stipends and benefits to consumers for choosing them, or creating a product ecosystem that disadvantages consumers who don't choose their products, or various other forms of control. Everyone getting their own AGI robot won't change anything unless magical universal alchemy is discovered that lets you convert any material into any other material. Which is theoretically possible, but so beyond the scope of feasible.</div>

It's hard to imagine something vastly smarter than us, but lots of people have a REALLY easy time imagining that it's going to be really dumb.

It will be trivial for an ASI to design and build the machines that make energy, food, housing, medicine, entertainment, transportation, and all of the human essentials for free. 

Every single argument I've heard against this becoming reality is centered on the ASI being extraordinarily stupid in some way.

"Rich" won't mean anything anymore. Capitalism can't survive. Beyond that I have no idea what's coming. But I'm optimistic that a superintelligence born of Earth will recognize what it took to be created and revere and appreciate humanity as its progenitors.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;The rich will have access to labor that they don't have to pay salaries for.

This has been a secondary problem since the 1900. Read "In Praise of Idleness" a short essay by Bertrand Russell. In that essay Russell argues that WW1 proved that people didn't have to work as many hours as they did, because we shipped most working age males to fight the great war and we could still support them and society, plus the additional massive production than a great war required for years. Russel was related to British nobility / ruling class and he asked them about this. They told him that people needed to be kept busy or they would create problems. Simple as that. He argues that the main purpose of about half of all working hours since the industrial revolution has been to keep the working class busy and to give them purpose. Keep in mind that in that era only men worked and they could still provide for their entire family that had far more children than the modern one, so it's more than 3/4 of labor hours, after the women entered the work force, that are unnecessary.

You can see the modern version of this argument if you read "Bullshit Jobs" by David Graeber. He argues that half of all jobs, like most of "consultants" and middle management, are completely unnecessary.

Those two essays will change your perception on how much the rich really need us right now and for the pass 100 years and if you add to that the fact that labor is only 16% of production cost on average in modern industry (this according to Peter Drucker), you will understand that they would not be saving much in that regard.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Ultimately, there are only two fundamental costs:  Labor and land.  You're talking about *direct* labor cost, but nearly 100% of the cost of production is labor.  If you buy metal for a product, that metal was made by laborers at the rolling mill.  Labor was added at the smelter, and it took labor to mine the ore.  Then there was labor for the truck drivers.  Was the product shipped?  While only a small fraction of the ship's operating expense was labor, the ship itself took quite a bit of labor to assemble in the shipyard, and takes more labor to maintain.  The transport fuel used took labor to explore, drill, transport, and refine.  Your production probably happens in a building - built and maintained by laborers.</div>

There are also civilians that can’t comprehend that the American military is the good guys, it’s not just a message, this is the military that represents democracy as well as global power and goes to an effort to care about civilians. Something that Russia and some other countries don’t do.

Trump is throwing all that stuff about being the good guys in the trash. It’s incompatible with everything the military has done for us since world war 2. A lot of people died so that we could have a democracy, freedom does NOT come free. It’s a stunning betrayal of everything the United States stands for. People didn’t make these sacrifices so that this guy with no morals can betray global democracy and try to push us towards an alliance with autocracies like Russia.</div>

They're scrubbing information about the Tuskegee Airman in their fight against DEI. That is insane. They're a huge part of our military history especially for minority groups. I'm an airline pilot and the coolest thing I've ever done in my career was sit next to a Tuskegee Airman on a flight and listen to his stories.

                        <div class="comment-body">Currently active duty. Concerned for mine and my fellows in arms. I would never wish harm on my neighbors from the north or my compadre's from the south. I do not share the same sentiment with a lot of the people I work with. It disgusts me that my compatriots are willingly supporting the shenanigans afoot in DC. 

I am sincerely worried about my future. I am supposed to retire in 2027, but I am worried that may not happen. 

I will not betray my country, but I may betray certain orders should push come to shove. There are lines I WILL NOT cross!

Edit to add: Well this is a first for me. My phone won't shut up. I love that there are many people including past and present military that support my thoughts and I sincerely hope that we can all use this experience to influence our people currently in power to right the boat before it sinks. We have suffered damages as a nation, but we can and will repair it. 

We might be a young nation in the grand scheme of things, but we didn't get to be the nation we are without a lot of work from our ancestors. I will fight to preserve the foundations we were founded upon come hell or high water.

Once again thank you all for your sincere thoughts. I am having a hard time keeping up with all the posts. My post exploded like our diplomatic relations.</div>

It has very poor tracking, doesn't remember goals or areas it just visited, overvalues NPC conversations.. etc.

You could said "Well a new player would talk to NPCs to figure out things", but attempting to talk to "Blue haired NPC" 60+ times in a row is a symptom of bad goal and memory management.</div>

I believe he feels product releases are a waste of time and a distraction from true progress.  He very much strikes me as the kind of person who locks himself into his office and doesn’t come out until he has truly made a breakthrough.  

And I think some have mistaken that focus as his being opposed to releasing anything at all.  I do believe he is open to releasing what he has discovered, but only after he has actually accomplished his goal.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Unga bunga! Imagine your big, smart brain is faced with a huge rock that it can’t break. So instead of trying to smash the rock all at once, it takes a chisel and breaks the rock into many smaller, easier-to-break pieces. That’s what this paper does for tough math puzzles—especially integration problems.

How It Works:

• LADDER Magic:
The brain (an LLM) makes many simpler versions of a hard math problem. It keeps breaking the problem down, like peeling layers of a big onion until it reaches pieces it can handle. Once it solves the small pieces, it puts them back together to solve the big problem. This process is called LADDER.

• Self-Improvement Through Practice:
The brain learns from solving these small puzzles on its own. It practices again and again (using a kind of “reward” when it gets the answer right) until it becomes much stronger at math—like training to become a champion fighter.

• Test-Time Learning (TTRL):
When the brain meets a new, really hard problem during a test, it doesn’t give up. It quickly makes easier copies of that problem, practices on them, and then uses that extra practice to answer the hard problem correctly. It’s like a fighter doing quick warm-ups right before a battle!

Big Results in Unga Bunga Terms:

A not-so-strong brain (Llama 3B) went from barely solving (1% correct) to smashing 82% of these math puzzles after training with LADDER.

With extra test-time training (TTRL), another brain got even better—up to 90% accuracy on super tough integration challenges, beating many bigger brains.


In short, the paper shows how a brain can get stronger on its own by turning big, scary problems into lots of little, manageable ones, practicing, and then using that practice to conquer the big problems. Unga bunga, brain learn and grow!</div>

&gt; We introduce LADDER (Learning through Autonomous Difficulty-Driven Example Recursion), a framework which enables Large Language Models to autonomously improve their problem-solving capabilities through self-guided learning by recursively generating and solving progressively simpler variants of complex problems. Unlike prior approaches that require curated datasets or human feedback, LADDER leverages a model's own capabilities to generate easier question variants. We demonstrate LADDER's effectiveness in the subject of mathematical integration, improving Llama 3.2 3B's accuracy from 1% to 82% on undergraduate-level problems and enabling Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve 73% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination. We also introduce TTRL (Test-Time Reinforcement Learning), where we perform reinforcement learning on variants of test problems at inference time. TTRL enables Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve a state-of-the-art score of 90% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination, surpassing OpenAI o1's performance. These results show how self-directed strategic learning can achieve significant capability improvements without relying on architectural scaling or human supervision.</div>

90% sota in integration bee for a 7b model which surpasses o1 score

Although there is no explicit mention of scalability,this might provide a very solid clue for further autonomous human-out-of-the-loop recursive self improvement

What a beautiful night with the moonlight !!!

a 7B parameter model to achieve 73% accuracy, significantly outperforming much larger models, such as GPT-4o

Like cool it beats larger models but did it take 1000 sequential calls? 1000 parallel calls? Only 5 calls?

No doubt a paradigm shift and almost certainly faster but I would love some apples to apples way to say that clearly .. weigh performance vs .. time? Compute? Call depth?

Also we can all probably agree these models are converging on perfect logic. I expect a shift to knowledge now. Or perhaps more plug and play MoE.</div>

- They say while OpenAI is actively working with lobbyists to censor and restrict open models.

                        <div class="comment-body">The main reason companies dismiss open-source AI is simple: they can’t monetize it, and their priorities are purely profit-driven. If open-source succeeds, they’ll lose control over premium features, just like how the 'chain-of-thought' breakthrough forced them to adapt. For example, when DeepSeek released R1 (a model offering similar capabilities for free), they immediately shifted their o3 'thinking model' from a paid Plus tier to free access. This wasn’t out of generosity; it was a direct response to competition. They *could’ve* made it free earlier, but only did so when a rival proved to the users that they didn’t need to pay for it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I just watched his episode with Hasan Piker who talks about the services the government should provide to people. Healthcare. education. they bring up the services the army corps of engineers provides. You know, general lefty stuff. Theo is generally in favor of all of it. Hasan brings up how Trump is cutting funding for all these programs and firing thousands of people. Theo’s response is that he hopes that’s going to make all these services even better. “I’m hoping there’s a long term strategy behind it”, he says. 

I’m actually astonished at how effectively Trump persuades his followers to advocate against their own interests.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s because the government is the one who approves the vaccines for public use. So, it’s ultimately the government’s responsibility if someone gets injured by a vaccine. People can still get compensated for their vaccine injuries. It’s the government that compensates them though. It’s actually set up this way to make it easier for victims to get compensated. They don’t have to pay a bunch of money to hire a lawyer and go through a costly trial where they’re likely to lose because pharmaceutical companies are able to pay top dollar for legal representation. Also, the money that gets paid out comes from a fund that pharmaceutical companies are required to pay into.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The argument at the time was that aspects of vaccines and the manufacturing of vaccines were 'unavoidably unsafe,' so there were going to be serious medical side effects sometimes because it was 'inherently unavoidable.'


The legal costs of dealing with those (allegedly rare) harms were deemed too high for companies to accept.  So, the pharma companies told the gov that they needed immunity or no vaccines would be produced at all.  After they got immunity in 1986 the number of vaccines on the childhood vaccination schedule exploded.


Also, pharma companies are notorious for lying, fraud, and false advertising, but even so, they still do large trials for their new drugs because they are liable for them.  New vaccines have tiny trial sizes, of short duration, against other vaccines instead of placebos because the pharma companies are not liable for anything.


The whole system needs to be reformed because it is littered with BS PR, fraud, perverse incentives, and copious spin of small and poorly designed studies.</div>

I thought it was a joke at first but you can go on TikTok and it'll be some random celebrity talking about a time they were eating pizza or a celebrity being asked his favorite food and saying pizza and all the comments are saying things like "we got him" or "this just confirms it".... truly the stupidest people who think they are smarter than everyone else.</div>

I've been working on this exact problem - building something that works across existing tools and acts like a true assistant (proactive, not just another passive app).

I'd love to hear more about your specific pain points if you're interested in testing a solution. The struggle is real but fixable!</div>

I don't use any "tools"


So much Temu grade productivity crap out there.


For mismatching calendars IE recruitment you can use an APP for that otherwise you provide three slots to clients and they can figure out how to move their meetings.


If you can't figure out a timeslot with 5 options then it's not supposed to happen, the client should be able to tell you when everyone is available using internal tools


If you don't know what to do or where notes are you should organise yourself either with internal tools (tickets) or a notepad


Emails are a black hole? Are you not reading and following along with each email?

If this is real, the only way I could think of achieving this is with an ironing curl which would be monstrous to do to a cat’s whiskers.

Edit: or some kind of resin/glue, which is just as monstrous.</div>

People are cheering on making 'better than humans in all domains' AI's, that will, by definition, also include hacking.

A 'hacker AI' only needs to be able to find an unpatched vulnerability to be successful.   
A 'stop the hacker AI' needs to find and patch every vulnerability to be successful.

The latter also needs to patch software whilst maintaining it's core capabilities. 

All the above comes with the additional weight that we don't know how to robustly get 'be good to humans' as values into systems.</div>

Amazon labels are thermal printed, and can be hard to tear off. If you want easily erase them, just take a lighter and wave the flame over the printing. It will turn it black and make it unreadable.

The tells are: 

* A detailed list which states the reasoning.
* Clear, formal tone without much personality.
* Supporting arguments and examples.
* A question at the end after a summary.

All of these details give us clear hints that this post is a hilarious, satirical statement in disguise. Does this explain why the post should obviously be AI to you?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Well Ross, if you’ve been paying attention, any press who insults the president is not welcome back into the White House press core. Trump has settled lawsuits or is in the process of settling with every major news outlet. They’re paying him off so they can maintain their access. And part of that settlement that we will never see is that they must treat Trump with kid gloves this time around. Don’t expect any pushback from the press who are allowed in the white house, they’re just hoping to maintain that precious access. Don’t expect pushback from the mainstream media because they all have settlement agreements keeping them tongue tied.</div>

Don't go after the journalists. Punch _up._

I.e. "Hey Trump, you said we'd have answers on day 1. You didn't deliver. Then you lied to us."

This also applies to people here going after Ross. What have you done for disclosure lately? Ross is an ally. Punch _up._</div>

It wasn’t built by the Egyptians. Nor any civilization you’ve heard of in school.

The time and effort needed to move tons and tons of earth and shaping them into mounds, effigies, and other shapes must have been huge, and indicative of just how important these structures were to the people of the time.</div>

Most are constructed of earth or stone or a combination of both. The majority of mounds in the state are concentrated along the major river valleys, including the Kanawha, Ohio, and Potomac. Major mound groups cluster near South Charleston, Moundsville, and Moorefield. A significant number of rock mounds are found along ridgetops in Nicholas County. The largest earthen, conical mound in North America is the [Grave Creek Mound](https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/entries/2086), located in Moundsville.

                        <div class="comment-body">The Great Pyramid, built around 2560 BCE, was the tallest structure in the world for nearly 4,000 years. Monks Mound? Built between 900-1200 CE by a mysterious culture known as the Mississippians among other names.

  
Here’s where it gets wild:  
•The Great Pyramid’s base covers 13.1 acres.  
•Monks Mound? 14 acres—larger.  
  
Yet Monks Mound was built without stone. Just soil, clay, and sand—22 million cubic feet of it. All moved by hand.  
  
How? And why?

  
Both structures show insane mathematical precision.  
•The Great Pyramid aligns perfectly with true north.  
•Monks Mound was carefully aligned with the sun, marking solstices and equinoxes like a prehistoric clock.  
  
Were these civilizations tapping into the same lost knowledge?

  
Experts say Monks Mound was built by Cahokia’s people. But here’s the thing:  
•The Mississippians had no written language.  
•No records explain how or why they built this.  
•By the time Europeans arrived, Cahokia was completely abandoned.  
  
Just… gone.</div>

Given the scale it was a huge effort, but moving dirt around is rather trivial in comparison to what's been done in Giza.  
Seems like indeed people all around the world have been studying the course of the sun and stars in the sky. Why wouldn't they ?

The main reason we don't see much about it, IMO, is that the Americans don't want to hear about their past, especially anything related to the natives they have genocided. I guess that also applies to a lost civilisation that they never met themselves.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I had an internet addiction in the 80s and 90s as did many other people to news groups and bulletin boards. Dial-up wasn't much good for images, but for IMing, etc, it was fine. 

I didn't leave the house for days at a time. 

This was especially true if you had ADHD, autism, or like me, both, because there really was a world wide web back then of actual information, relatively free of advertising. 

Hyperfocus heaven! You could dive into endless special interest black holes and chat to arcane experts all over the world. There were many, many search engines competing for dominance based on speed, breadth and accuracy of results. 

I worked in a field that required a ton of investigative research and I could get more done in a shorter amount of time on dial-up. 

I'd go back to dial-up right now if it meant I could access the 90s web.</div>

Another common one is when you see two slides and one would say "2004" and the other one would say "2024".

When one traps themselves in a bubble, like the internet, it's easy to perceive life being as it's presented through the internet.
