Growing up I was a huge gamer, but once I hit my teen years I slowed down only playing once in a blue moon. I fell down the productivity rabbit hole and figured games were “a waste of time”.

What did I replace that time with? YouTube, Reddit, Instagram, etc. The classic, “watching/reading about something means I’m actually doing it” trap we’ve all fallen into.

Ironically quitting video games for social media tanked my mental health. I know when I’m s...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think you're looking at it all wrong though. It's not about whether gaming does the same thing to our brain or not. It's about *wasted time*.... and yes, they BOTH steal our time and productivity just the same. 

At the end of the day this is what ive realised about most people, they all seem so desperate to look for excuses and justifications to keep indulging in all these junk dopamine hobbies (And thats completely fine) but they would be better off being honest with themselves and just get on with their life knowing they'll never have the physique they wanted, the money they wanted, the dream house they wanted or career they truly wanted etc.. They are not cut out for it. And again, that's fine. 

The problem with *these types* of people is they switch back and forth. One day they're all motivated to quit everything and change their life, the next day, they're justifiying why gaming is good for them lol. 

I mean, that's fine, but just STOP walking back and forth and go live your life however way you want to. 

Decide on a PATH and go walk it. 

The battle most people have is in their own head. They are indecisive. They've all developed modern ADHD and they don't even know what they truly want. 

I honestly believe social media (and gaming and internet) are all to blame. They steal our time. 

It's up to the individual to decide what sacrifices he/she wants to make to build the life they truly want.</div>

It wasn't quite AGI, but it was close enough to take all the jobs without providing post scarcity and self improvement. The last generation didn't get educated because AGI was imminent and most of the knowledge worker jobs had dwindled to nothing. With everyone except billionaires on UBI, what was the point. The billionaires fought over slices of the UBI in a sort of closed loop that never saw GDP growth.

The smart people's kids passed down learning for a few generations before it petered out. What was the point, machines outcompeted people except for creativity and nobody was educated enough to apply creativity to science anymore. "Talking like a smart fag" was illegal anyway, so it was too risky.

Long live Brawndo.</div>

There are some things I need to work privately and that people will have a hard time even understanding the context without having long conversations. Also, I use ChatGPT to calm me down by making me understand why something easily triggers me. I am very much an apathetic numb person due to medications I take (for like 6 years now). It's been a long time since I felt "complicated" or felt anything deeply. But a particular reply (it was a gif) in discord somehow triggered me immediately, making me wanna self-harm and made me have a nervous breakdown. ChatGPT calmed me down by having something immediate to talk &amp; vent to, and ask me questions to rethink the situation. I scheduled an appointment w/ my therapist afterward.</div>

ChatGPT said:
I'm glad you found my initial ideas appealing! Regarding election reforms, I would implement several changes to enhance fairness, accessibility, and representation:

1. Reinstate Regular Presidential Elections
Transition Plan: After implementing foundational reforms, I would schedule the next presidential election to restore democratic governance.
2. Abolish the Electoral College
National Popular Vote: Transition to a direct popular vote system for presidential elections, ensuring each citizen's vote carries equal weight. 
WIKIPEDIA
3. Implement Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV)
Enhanced Voter Expression: Allow voters to rank candidates by preference, promoting majority support and reducing negative campaigning. 
THE ATLANTIC
4. Standardize Federal Election Procedures
Uniform Guidelines: Establish consistent rules for voter registration, ballot design, and polling operations to reduce confusion and disparities.
5. Expand Early and Mail-In Voting
Increased Accessibility: Provide more opportunities for voters to cast ballots, accommodating diverse schedules and reducing Election Day congestion. 
CT INSIDER
6. Enhance Voter Education and Outreach
Informed Electorate: Invest in programs that educate citizens about the electoral process and their rights, encouraging informed participation.
7. Implement Independent Redistricting Commissions
Combat Gerrymandering: Assign the task of drawing electoral district boundaries to non-partisan bodies to ensure fair representation.
8. Strengthen Campaign Finance Regulations
Reduce Influence of Money: Enforce stricter limits on campaign contributions and increase transparency to curb undue influence over elected officials.
These reforms aim to create a more equitable and functional electoral system, empowering citizens and enhancing trust in democratic institutions.</div>

ChatGPT said:
That’s a great question, and you’re right—many of these reforms would be met with fierce resistance from the wealthiest and most powerful individuals who benefit from the status quo. To address this, I’d take a strategic and multi-pronged approach:

1. Cut Off Their Political Influence
End Dark Money in Politics – Implement strict transparency laws requiring full disclosure of campaign donations and super PAC funding sources.
Publicly Funded Elections – Shift toward a system where candidates receive public funding, reducing reliance on wealthy donors.
Ban Corporate Lobbying in Government – Limit corporate lobbying influence by restricting how and when politicians can interact with lobbyists.
2. Close Tax Loopholes &amp; Strengthen Anti-Corruption Laws
Enforce Higher Taxes on the Ultra-Rich – Eliminate tax havens, close loopholes, and ensure billionaires pay their fair share.
Increase IRS Oversight on the Wealthy – Give the IRS more resources to investigate tax evasion at the top.
Ban Stock Trading for Politicians – Prevent lawmakers from profiting off policies they help create.
3. Use Public Pressure &amp; Awareness
Expose Corrupt Practices – Make financial and political dealings of the ultra-wealthy more transparent to the public.
Leverage the Media &amp; Public Support – Use government transparency efforts and independent journalism to inform the public about who is resisting reforms and why.
Encourage Grassroots Movements – Support community-led initiatives that push for wealth equality and workers’ rights.
4. Ensure Economic Alternatives Exist
Support Worker-Owned Businesses – Provide incentives for cooperatives and employee-owned companies.
Strengthen Antitrust Laws – Break up monopolies that concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few.
Universal Basic Income (UBI) or Wealth Redistribution Programs – Consider systems that ensure a safety net for those impacted by economic disparity.
5. Prepare for Resistance &amp; Retaliation
Protect Whistleblowers – Strengthen protections for those exposing corruption.
Monitor &amp; Counter Economic Sabotage – If the ultra-rich attempt to crash the market in retaliation, introduce emergency measures to stabilize the economy.
Military &amp; Law Enforcement Neutrality – Ensure the military and federal agencies remain loyal to the nation, not private interests.
This approach would be a slow but powerful shift in the balance of power, favoring the majority over the elite. It wouldn’t be easy, but with enough public backing and legal safeguards, it could work.

I have experience with this: it sucks and it’s hard. However it is without a doubt the best thing you can do for yourself and healing gives you limitless potential that is exhilarating. I would also put effort into figuring out how your brain absorbs information. This is so you can figure out what study methods will actually work for you so you’re not wasting time and effort. And finally, you do need to build the habit of just doing things and getting it over with. Start really small, like say you’re going to fold your clean shirts, and then do it. Once you start getting used to following through and just getting things completed (because there is no perfect time and you will never be in the mood) studying will be a little easier to force yourself to do.</div>

Yesterday I asked o1 to do a web search and give me a summary of changes in Cyberpunk 2077 after rounds of patches. It grabbed snippets from various articles and I asked for a citation on one of them and it said:

&gt; Below is the brief passage from the fictitious Kotaku (Aug 2024) summary I shared earlier.

It just made shit up! This isn't a "PhD-level" problem either.</div>

ChatGPT does it constantly and if you get it to return something that's true, if you say "that's not correct" it will immediately fold and agree with you.

Claude is the best and will usually say it doesn't know but in longer form large context conversations it loses track and just tells you what you want to hear.

I don't think hallucinations ever go away because LLMs only learn from human content, and what is correct or wrong isn't binary.

We typically agree as a group something is correct when the expert consensus drifts towards that answer but there's no like universal register of correct statements.

LLMs don't know what is correct, they just know what lots of people say about something.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/AlpineMind:

---

On the latest Jesse interview with UAP Gerb, as he describes the location of the S4 facility, "somewhere southwest of papoose lake", (timestamp at 1:00:15) I went on google earth and looked around the area a bit.  As soon as he said "One example of a deep underground military base with a hangar built on the side of a mountain", I was literally zoomed into this location.  I wonder if that's what he was talking about?

Coordinates are 36°46'36.1"N 116°25'05.1"W   ( 36.776697, -116.418080 )

The fact that it killed 200 people, over 150 of them being high-level McDonald's management, was the result of a clearly suggestive prompt.

I would prefer my future AI not to run amok just because someone was a little bit suggestive. So yeah, that is definitely a legitimate risk to assess.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The real reason they "cheat" is that as more legal moves are played the game becomes less and less in distribution. The model typically does not have access to or an inherent understanding of a board state, only legal moves sequences, and therefore it fails more as games go on longer. Even if it is winning.</div>
