It was insane the difference… it was so much easier to clear my mind when I was fasting and so much easier to get into a zen state. 

I could barely clear my mind or enter zen state when I wasn’t fasting. Then I ended up ending 2 minutes early when not fasting because I got bored (had 10 minute timer)… yet when I was fasting I did 10 minutes more... and I wanted to go for longer bu...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I found this to be true for me. The first time I began meditating in my late teens I got a stomach bug and wasn't able to eat for 48 hours. I had been meditating regularly for about 4 months at that point. I found it incredibly easy at the end of that accidental fast in fact that is when I accidentally had a lucid dream, realized I was dreaming and then started to leave my body. (had an astral projection type event occur) It actually really startled me a bit which I didn't expect to feel. 

In any case I can confirm and I suspect it's why fasting is embedded in so many different religious practices throughout the ages because its a useful boost. I do my meditation first thing in the morning partially for this reason and because it's quiet and I'm more quiet internally upon waking.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Your physical body doesn't have energy therefore the realised self can shine easier through it. Your physical body tries to reduce its energy output and it's less active, when it's fed it has energy to cause more noise. Fasting is great for sure if you have will and time to do it, it will be definitely great help during meditations. Of course don't overdoit and careful about fasting too much, your physical body needs nutrition.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This feels like it would be incredibly hardware heavy. I'm not saying Text2game is not coming, but generating an environment is one of the least important parts of the game. Especially that a lot of levels are designed from straight up boxes, then environment is put into it, as most levels are designed in a way where only part of the level is seen at the same time, so your PC does not have to generate it all at a same time. Not even talking about navmeshes and physics boxes so you and NPCS don't get stuck somewhere.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I'm a big fan of agentic coding with Claude Code, but I've noticed it gets expensive pretty quickly if you don't have a Max plan, especially when using Opus.

Since I also use ChatGPT a lot for both work and personal projects, I'm considering either a ChatGPT Pro or Claude Max subscription. I've tested ChatGPT Codex (cloud) on my Plus plan, but in my opinion, it doesn't come close to what Claude 4 (even the non-Opus version) can do.

I've read that ChatGPT Pro gives you access to the o3-pro mode...</div>

I have have had ChatGPT Plus , which also gives you access to the web version of o3-pro. So it might not be exactly comparable with the API version of o3-pro, but o3-pro suuuuper slow. It's on the same speed level as "deep research". I never really used it because I didn't want to wait 3-5 minutes every time I sent in a prompt</div>

Text/Image to 3D World: You can type something like "a peaceful forest with a river" and get a 3D environment you can move around in.
Ready for VR &amp; Games: It creates full 360° scenes and you can export them as 3D meshes to use in game engines like Unity or Unreal.
Interactive Objects: The AI is smart enough to separate objects from the background, so you can actually move things around inside the scene.</div>

They are too stupid to contribute meaningfully to political discourse, have felt like they have been marginalized and dictated to by "the elites" and "the left", and this makes them very angry.  Their emotions drive their behavior, and when they see Dong lashing out in blind and nonsensical rage, they think - "hey that's exactly how I act when I'm pissed!  That guy is so cool!"

TLDR: they are stupid, emotional cripples.</div>

But this meme reminded me of what Satan said.</div>

No one applying to any degree program to get a job is safe considering it will be 4-10 years before they enter the workforce.  Imagine wtf things are going to be like in TEN YEARS?  If there are any jobs at all, they won't be entry-level.

I think people should either not go to college or go to the cheapest state school that they can and major in whatever is the most interesting to them.  You won't regret learning about something you are passionate about, at least, even if it results in no job.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is the debate happening in my house now. Daughter is 15 and we have been saving for college since she was 1. But wife was suggesting we need to increase those savings because daughter is interested in the arts (she attends a fine and performing arts high school) and some of those colleges are pretty pricey. I’m against it because I think whatever she does with her education is likely to be a poor investment and she will be better off if we can accumulate as many assets as possible. The future is people who own assets vs those who don’t, it won’t be something you can work your way into because work is going away. Become part of the owner class now if you can.</div>

A lot of denial. Reaffirming echo chambers (only listening to those that think the same way) I’ve seen on other subs lawyers saying that their job is impossible to automate, too intricate, multi-disciplinary etc. 

People just don’t realise that before the job is automated, the roles are cut - 10 lawyers now becomes 3, then AI designs a new more efficient way of doing things ready to automate completely. It’s also just a lack of imagination, how do people think their job is safe when AGI/ASI is built - they think a super intelligent genius can’t do their job but they can? Lol</div>

It’s more than just Butler Snow’s fiasco — courts across the U.S. have disciplined lawyers for submitting made‑up case citations generated by AI at least seven times over the past two years  .

Here's the breakdown:

1. Morgan &amp; Morgan lawyers faced threats of sanctions for using fictitious case law in a lawsuit against Walmart  .


2. A Manhattan federal judge fined two lawyers in June 2023 for invented citations in a personal injury suit against an airline  .


3. A New York case with Michael Cohen, where his lawyer submitted AI-generated fake citations — no sanctions but strong rebuke  .


4. A Texas wrongful termination case where a lawyer paid a fine and had to take a generative AI course for citing non-existent cases  .


5. A Minnesota deep‑fake parody case in which an expert lost credibility over unverified AI citations  .


6. The MyPillow/Mike Lindell defamation case: attorneys fined $3,000 each for submitting an AI‑generated filing containing 30 incorrect or fake citations  .


7. And now, the Butler Snow case, where three attorneys were removed and publicly reprimanded for AI‑fabricated citations in court documents  .



So that’s at least seven confirmed incidents involving lawyers being sanctioned or reprimanded for AI-generated “hallucinations” in legal filings.

🔎 More context on Butler Snow’s case:

Judge Anna Manasco (Northern District of Alabama) disciplined three partners — Matthew Reeves, William Cranford, and William Lunsford. The attorneys had submitted filings containing five fabricated citations across two motions, admitted they used ChatGPT without verification, and were disqualified from the case  .

Butler Snow conducted reviews—internally and via external firm Morgan Lewis—across 40 dockets and over 2,400 citations. They found no other errors and called the incident an **“isolated event”**  .</div>

We see a lot of traffic flow through our open source edge/service proxy for LLM-based apps. One failure mode that most recently tripped us up (as we scaled deployments of [archgw](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw) at a telco) were transient errors in streaming LLM responses.

I’m pretty weak, I go to the gym but it’s fairly inconsistent (I’m a med student so some weeks I have more time than others leading to inconsistency). My aunt is an avid cross fitter and wants me to go with her, and I’m honestly willing because it seems like a great way to meet people and I want to be more active, but the class seems so intimidating, it’s like training for war lol.

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes! My gym is predominately women and many are not what you’d call “athletic” types—some are very skinny, some are overweight. A good coach will find ways to scale the workout to any skill level. 35 lb dumbbells too heavy? Try 15. Still too heavy? Just do it without dumbbells at all or try a different movement entirely that will work the same muscles. The idea is to meet you wherever you are and slowly build from there. No one would tease or look down on you for scaling—everyone starts somewhere!</div>

Ghislaine was sentenced unfairly because there is no client list and for her to be guilty, there need to be clients that girls were trafficked to. So since there was no island, no clients, Ghislaine can go home. Another democrat hoax busted. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER AND WE GIVE 500 BILLIONS TO ISRAEL!</div>

Instead, realize that the most valuable of those are the 3–4 hours when you have peak mental energy.  In that time frame, schedule your important decision-making, mentally-intensive work, and emotionally taxing tasks.  Save the busy/mindless work for other times in the day.

I take the train to work and have two routes I can take. The faster route requires that I transfer along the way.  Another route gets me there directly but takes longer.  In this case, the effort does not outweigh the benefit - I will gladly free myself from the mental and physical burden of transferring and just except the longer time. I usually read so I don't even consider the time 'wasted'.</div>

If I had a robot right now it would be mostly for doing laundry, sweeping floors, and doing dishes. If I had a robot ten years from now I would treat it more like a companion and relegate more executive household functions to it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Laundry robot would be sick. I’d actually pay good money for that if clothes could go from my dirty hamper to pressed and hanging in my closet. I already have a robot that sweeps and mops for me and I love it. Scrubbing the bathroom would be another huge level up. If my laundry robot could do dishes or dust too that would be an added bonus but could take it or leave it. Grocery shopping and putting the groceries away would be another great addition but for whatever reason I don’t really hate grocery shopping. Not like I hate laundry and cleaning floors. If the robot could do dishes, bathrooms, groceries but not laundry I still wouldn’t buy it. Personal robot all hinges on laundry for me with anything else being a bonus.</div>

&gt; In 1977, Asimov had a heart attack. In December 1983, he had triple bypass surgery at NYU Medical Center, during which he contracted HIV from a blood transfusion. His HIV status was kept secret out of concern that the anti-AIDS prejudice might extend to his family members. He died in Manhattan on April 6, 1992, and was cremated. The cause of death was reported as heart and kidney failure.  

&gt; Ten years following Asimov's death, Janet and Robyn Asimov agreed that the HIV story should be made public; Janet revealed it in her edition of his autobiography, It's Been a Good Life.</div>
