                        <div class="comment-body">So, since alot of people here are debating this to be real or not, or sadly making the wrong conclusions, allow me to shed some light as someone living in the Netherlands.

1. A group of people have indeed started a juridical case against bill gates.
2. Prior to actually going into specifics, gates lawyers challenged the court case, saying the dutch court has no jurisdiction in the matter.
3. The court has ruled they do in fact have jurisdiction.

That is where we are at. The actual case will proceed at a later date.

He has not been found guilty yet. The court fees he has to pay are purely to compensate the other side for dragging them into the 'jurisdiction' battle and the costs they made over it.

This is the actual court decision, sadly in dutch, but google translate should mostly help you:

Saying that we won't need humans for most things could have been considered "saying it out right" maybe 5 years ago, when that would have been thought of as a sci-fi scenario. But in 2025 "saying it out right" implies going one step further and explaining that both dystopian and utopian outcomes are possible.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I worry that people are unknowingly cheering for their own demise. 

Just to be clear, I don't think AI will kill humans, I think that billionaires controlling AI won't need us anymore once all human jobs are automated and their walled garden is in place.

If two AI driven countries go to war - with fully automated AI armies - they will soon have to decide whether to commit limited resources into either feeding and housing a now useless population, or build more murder bots to keep up with the enemy's murder bots.

It kinda goes downhill from there...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I honestly think a presidential o3, with a less censored worldview than current public models, would absolutely do a much better job making decisions than Trump.  If you just had aides and cabinet members going out and doing the work, coming back to the president for final sign off, which is basically how it works.  It would almost certainly do a better job than Biden as well, who was clearly mentally compromised.

By 2028?  We will probably have several models running that are better equipped to be president than most if not all of the candidates running for the job.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm probably like a lot of former smokers that tried to quit a number of times before being successful. Then a friend and I were out fishing and he began talking about quitting smoking. He wanted to bet $50 that he could outlast me. Beer drinking and trash talking commenced and the bet got up to $500. So I am way too cheap to lose a bet like that and so I went weeks without the butts. My friend came around, admitted that he was back on the smokes and paid up the $500. I was tempted to go back but was feeling so much better without the cigs, kept it going.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Went out one Thursday evening with some friends and friends of friends, back when you could smoke in the pub.

Got chatting to a girl, hit it off and at the end of the night, said our goodbyes and parted with a vague plan to meet up again, maybe next week.

Friday lunchtime, lasagne and a pint with some of the group from the night before (when having a couple of pints at lunchtime was acceptable), I lit up a cigarette after eating and the friend, who had introduced me to the girl the previous night, mentioned "oh, you know that girl you were talking to last night? She's not a big fan of smoking".

I thought for a brief moment, stubbed out my Camel, crumpled up the packet that was left, threw my lighter and have not been tempted to light up since.

That was 1990 and this May, we will have been married for 32 years.</div>

He told her that she was so fine, that he quit. Then he balled up the pack and threw them in the trash. She laughed and gave him her number. They didn't date long, but that did actually motivate him to quit.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I believe that no one is beyond help—except, perhaps, for kids who grow up entirely glued to screens with a dopamine addiction lol. But everyone has a starting point, and it's always possible to detox the brain from the constant dopamine rush.

Personally, I feel like I’m about halfway through my journey toward screen freedom. What has helped me the most is deleting all the apps that mindlessly fill the boredom void and allowing myself to actually be bored. Then, as a reward—or for a set amount of time—I use apps that aren’t as harmful as short-form content, preferably on a PC, making access slightly more intentional.

Yoga and mindfulness have also played a big role in helping me regain my lost attention span. Additionally, reading books on an e-reader has helped redirect my boredom toward something engaging that still requires mental effort.

Hope this helps, and stay strong!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don't think this call is an example of it, but sometimes the scammers are themselves victims of a human trafficking outfit, and they are acting while under the constant threat of physical punishment. In that scenario, their frustration makes sense if they feel their time is being wasted.

**Edit**: To clarify, my understanding is that this is not widespread, but has been increasing in recent years, particularly with pig-butchering scams.</div>

The whole social media thing is weird tho, like caring about likes and hearts. Maybe try setting boundaries with your phone use? Turn off notifications, delete some apps. That helped me a lot. And try to plan regular meetups with friends, even if its just once a month. Its harder as adults but worth it.</div>

Edit: oh this one made you people mad lol.

It doesn’t have to be UBI, but there needs to be a plan. Reduced work weeks allowing multiple people to work the same job. More local jobs cleaning parks, that sort of thing. More military jobs. Who knows. Every country on Earth is going to handle this differently.

I’m not pushing communism ffs, UBI just makes the most sense if there’s only one job per 10 people.

I’d rather work to be completely fair.</div>

Software engineering is going to change, but not go away. In fact, there'll be more need for us than ever.

                                <div class="reply-body"> Greetings, brave soul! In case you were wondering, I'm Shrek. The big, green, grumpy ogre with a soft spot for donuts and a strong dislike for small talk. But since you seem to have stumbled upon my humble abode, allow me to regale you with some of my favorite stories.

Like that time I rescued Fiona from a tower, only to find out she had been turned into an ogre herself! It was quite the shock, but we somehow managed to find love in each other's eyes. Or that other time when I thought I was a duck. It's a long story involving a witch and an enchanted pond, but let's just say it ended with me chasing my reflection in a mirror and almost getting hit by a train.

So, tell me, dear friend - are you a fan of swamp creatures? And what's your favorite type of donut? Personally, I'm partial to the ones with sprinkles and filled with jam. They remind me of the times when I was still considered to be "clean on the inside." Ah, nostalgia.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">it's deeper than that unfortunately:

the right are controlled by fundamentalist christian billionaires, it's why Speaker Johnson and Justice Alito both have "An Appeal to Heaven" flags in their offices and houses, they are part of the NAR movement (New Apostolic Reformation) which is basically a Christian supremacist ideology cooked up by some churches with some collaboration with the cia during the cold war ( to make a form of christianity that was less susceptible to socialist/communist messaging), it's the reason tucker carlson started talking about seeing physical demons on his show

they are doing this because they believe in dominionism, that they have a mandate for aggressive social transformation by any means necessary to create God's kingdom on Earth, that is why they are crippling the government and other institutions like universities - because our institutions are secular and guarantee rights for everyone regardless of identity or beliefs, freedom of expression etc

it's also why they are instigating conflicts with our european allies, because they are very socially liberal and mostly secular, same with the US led liberal world order - that doesn't allow for dominion

if you see the decline of the past 30 years through the lens of fundamentalist billionaires with authoritarian tendencies opposing the secular world order I think things come together to create a clear picture

- Helped organize the Charlottesville Rally
- Hosted a pro-facism podcast, Fash the Nation. Podcast isn't active anymore but you can still find the episodes online via Google.
- Started a anti-democracy subreddit - literally /r/EndDemocracy

Those were all from different moderators across 5-6 different years.

Edit: In defense of a tiny, tiny minority of libertarians, Dan Carlin is also one but those are few and far in between. I typically am very skeptical of anyone who openly identifies as one until I hear them talk.</div>

I use Roots (found it on reddit), it's worked pretty well for me... lets you block certain parts of the day and has pretty flexible options for set up.   
  
There are several out there which offer this type of blocking. I've also tried Jomo and one sec in the past. If you search "app blocking" on the App Store you'll see a few you can check out.</div>

•	⁠President Donald J Trump

In 2016 a woman who went by the pseudonyms Katie Johnson and Jane Doe in legal filings accused Trump of raping her in 1994, when she was 13, during an orgy held at Epstein’s home in Manhattan. She accused Epstein of raping her as well.

Three suits were filed over the same allegations; the first was dismissed for failure to properly state a claim, and the other two were voluntarily dismissed. The third case was withdrawn just days before the 2016 election, and the accuser canceled a press conference at the last minute. Her attorney, Lisa Bloom, said the woman had received death threats and, “She has decided she is too afraid to show her face … She is in terrible fear.”
