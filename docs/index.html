                <div class="post-content">Okay so I have a horrible phone addiction and it's making me not be productive. I have so many passions and things I am interested in doing, but it's just this phone is just so easy to grab and watch stuff on. I hate the fact that it's making me into this lazy unproductive person, bc I could be so much more. Also doesn't help that it has gotten worse since I moved into my own apartment. 

I don't ofc want to get rid of it since I need it for calls etc, but this feels so hard to break out of.

                                <div class="reply-body">maybe its not 5 million but definitely cheaper. if you had read the paper, the approach to use RL makes a lot of sense and cheaper than a pure training on massive corpus of text

anyway, the model si there for you to download (all 671 billion parameters). Wake me when OpenAI or Grok decides to release in such a manner too.

Fact is, the US is releasing less and less academic papers on the topic and a massive amount of papers are being released by the chinese. Not defending the chinese but its a bit more than just "they are not spending enough money" fallacy.

Anyway, nothing stopping the other companies to copy the same methods and benefit from the method. If its true, then everyone benefits. if its false, we'll find out sooner or later.</div>

He owns part of Reddit, Stripe, and other companies. Remember, he was already a venture investor when he founded OpenAI and was president of YCombinator.

Estimates range from just over $1B to $2B.

Innumeracy is alive and well I guess. People do not understand numbers, especially at scale.

There were 100 contributors to the DeepSeek R1 paper alone - you mean to tell me these top notch AI scientists are all making under 60k? Or let’s say this breakthrough took 6 months instead of a full year- that would mean all of the scientists are making less than 120k each?

H100 GPUs alone cost $40k a pop, and that’s only if you have easy access to them. And you can’t just do this kind of training on one, you need at a minimum hundreds of them.

It was also made very clear in the paper that they had gone through several training runs before finding the right RL configuration, paired with the right supervised fine-tuning process (to fix some of its language issues). It wasn’t a one-shot thing.

                                <div class="reply-body">So I went to college to study computer science, and my intro year class was notoriously a difficult, weed-out kinda class because the program just didn’t have capacity. The professor wasn’t mean but he didn’t pull punches. No extra credit assignments, no fluff to pad your grade, no excuses for not doing the assignments and learning the content. Tough but fair. He was also a funny guy, very down to earth and  would joke/playfully roast his students in lecture, but always encouraged asking questions. He’d always do the math with tuition, and say like “you all paid $200 to get me in this room lecturing, so if you aren’t following along you’re wasting $200. Stop me and ask questions, no matter how dumb. Don’t let me move on until you’re caught up. If you’re confused, I guarantee someone else in the class has the same question but is too shy to ask it.”

There was this one kid Carter who decided he was completely fine not being the shy one. He didn’t have any CS background coming in, unlike maybe 90% of the CS majors, so in the first few weeks he was taking up like 15 or 20 minutes of our 75 minute lecture asking basic stuff to the point where it became a running joke. He’d ask a dumb question, the professor would roast him but answer it genuinely, then the process would repeat. Some people got really annoyed with how much time it took up. Carter really did not give a shit though and just kept asking his questions, and pretty quickly the questions stopped being dumb.

Anyways, Carter got the highest grade in the class on the final exam.</div>

Doesn't help that a lot of companies don't want to invest in their employees anymore and want someone who already knows what they are doing. Watching my server team fill up with people who are all senior level and all the seniors bitching and moaning because they have to do entry level stuff because management requires a 4 year degree to even work at the company is slightly hilarious and equally frustrating.</div>

But here's the real reason I am excited about deepseek and everyone else in the AI world seems to be as well.

Despite Chinese models being censored, they're still open source. Which means someone could replicate it and create uncensored models with it. Basically they are giving away the knowledge to build these things to the entire world, ensuring that no one...</div>

This open source release is literally just China throwing a bone to all the “Tier 2” countries that were going to have compute limits placed upon them by the US as part of its recent round of AI/chip export controls. The US wanted to control which countries could use AI to speed up economic development, and force them to sign “security agreements” with the US to increase their compute limits.

Now, with R1-Zero’s training method, developing countries can develop their own AI systems without worrying about having to sign agreements to align with “US values” just for increased compute limits.</div>

Edit. Reddit is a poor representation of people in real life. I know people on both sides of the political spectrum and we all get along. I think a lot of people are addicted to arguing politics. People on here say you shouldn’t even associate with friends or family who are republican. I’m left, but this place is very left.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm conflicted. The web interface of ChatGPT has much nicer features.

The Deepseek web interface is way too barebones.

Using the Deepseek API with OpenWebUI works, but Deepseek still doesn't see images (it only does OCR), which is otherwise a significant amount of what I use ChatGPT for.

The other day I had both ChatGPT and Deepseek read the same contract for my rental, and Deepseek did a MUCH better job. It was extremely spot on, even though it was in Danish.


edit: Tbh, right now, I'm considering cancelling the ChatGPT subscription, and just fill up either an OpenRouter wallet or DeepSeek+ChatGPT with $10 each, and see how it goes. According to my calculations, it'll be significantly cheaper, and I can just switch model in OpenWebUI if I need Vision.


Edit 2: Through the API, if I ask Deepseek V3 "Who are you? Who made you?" it'll say it's ChatGPT by OpenAI lmao 


It'll say that no matter how many times I regenerate, but if I ask Deepseek R1, it'll sometimes say it's Claude by Anthropic, sometimes Deepseek by Deepseek and sometimes it's ChatGPT.

                                <div class="reply-body">Also "better" is just one factor. How much compute does it need to be better. O1 Pro is a little better than O1 but even there the range of task where it is justified to use it is limited. 

The O3 high-compute Arc test was approximated to be **$1,148,444**. That limits the range of task you can use it.   
If you would do research on this scale you need to test, reprompt many times to a point it is not viable. 

TLDR: "better" is not a meaningful achievement standing on its own.</div>

He is also staunchly against UBI and thinks it is a utopian fantasy. Are we headed for a second french revolution soon, or will the super rich find a way to slaughter the masses? Why is this not being discussed more? For added context on the above links, the first link is an article he wrote 2 years ago. The second link is him reposting the article on X yesterday.

Will some governments try to legislate stagnation? Sure.

Will it work? Not for long! 

We’d still be hunter gatherers if that worked.

But let’s be real: it’s REALLY not how it works in the U.S.  Moneyed, established interests may try, but things move to slow and they can’t win forever against rapid competition.

Railroads were a massive industry that was unable to stop the automotive or aviation industries.

Cabs couldn’t stop uber even in an already highly regulated field.

I hear others that are actually serious about this, and it seems they haven't put any forethought into the dynamics of this supposed aftermath -- pretty sure in chinese culture it is learned that war is a game of the elite members, where peace and co-op far outweigh the senseless slaughter 'in the name of'. In other words, why perpetuate violence that ultimately gets you nowhere?... in the end working together (both after wars or not) is the only way to push forward into the future, why not skip the carnage and despair and the bad name.</div>

they're likely "people" just like you and i, but they've been around for a very long time and are extremely far ahead technologically, think of a type III or type IV civilization on the [kardashev scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale), yeah they would "seem" god-like to us, but they would still have followed all the biological evolutionary stages we're going through, they've just been around much longer, that's all, no myth or fairy tales here</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">cuz aliens/consciousness (human and otherwise)/spirituality (on a personal/inner level, not the dogma of religion)/inter-dimensional beings/psychic phenomena/quantum physics/etc are more intertwined than most people are open to believing rn cuz most people are only interested in one side of things.

“angel” and “alien” are just words people came up with, the labels aren’t really important, it’s more about how everything is ultimately from the same source (whatever you prefer to call the source, we are all fractals of it), we are all connected via our consciousness, and that there are different levels of consciousness.

don’t shoot the messenger if you don’t like the response tho, i’m just letting you know why it comes up at least for some people, can’t speak for people painting it with an actual christian brush though and trying to make it literally that. 

that said, using the word “angel” isn’t necessarily that, and different beliefs systems from around the world actually are relevant to this particular discussion once we start exploring consciousness and other beings. philosophy and religion are both relevant. buddhism, taoism, hinduism, etc. even christianity and other abrahamic religions, they’re just the most stripped, distorted, and tainted atp if you aren’t looking deep enough. but there are similar truths within them all. 

i get it cuz i was similarly pretty anti-religion in the past, but to brush everything you don’t understand or like off as nothing more than fairy tales is reductive and not gonna take us anywhere. don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. don’t take everything at face value. don’t disregard the symbolic either. 

you kinda have to open your heart and your mind. merge the intellect and the imagination. 

love and unity is what will take us where we wanna go.</div>

I asked for diminished value but the at fault driver's insurance said they wouldn't pay it since they didn't do the repairs. My point back to them was that the repair was irrelevant since the carfax will show a wreck no matter who fixed it. They found a way to throw me some extra money to make me go away.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My state does, and I advised my friend of that after they got rear ended - but the insurance company denied it. Apparently the only recourse for that is to sue the at-fault driver (or their insurance company if they have one) and they didn't think the headache was worth it 

This wasn't my accident or claim so I didn't get all the details. There's probably something I'm missing that let them deny it in the first place, but my point is that even when the law is on your side, the insurance company will still do their best to pay as little as possible.</div>

Submission Statement: 

Two Kentucky police officers were flying a helicopter at a scene of a suspect break-in in 1993 when they saw something they couldn’t explain. They said a fast-traveling, egg-shaped UFO shot three fireballs at them before flying away.

They also refer to it as “pear-shaped.” And the UFO also supposedly damaged their helicopter.

Because I don't have anyone to talk to, I find it harder to break out of no scroll. I end up scrolling Reddit for hours and visit subreddits that are toxic, such as female l00ksmaxxing sites and such. </div>
