Transformers used to solve a math problem that stumped experts for 132 years: Discovering global Lyapunov functions. Lyapunov functions are key tools for analyzing system stability over time and help to predict dynamic system behavior, like the famous three-body problem of celestial mechanics: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08304

Google DeepMind used a large language model to solve an unsolved math problem: https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/14/1085318/google-deepmind-large-language-model-solve-unsolvable-math-problem-cap-set/

Prof Penadés' said the tool had in fact done more than successfully replicating his research.
"It's not just that the top hypothesis they provide was the right one," he said.
"It's that they provide another four, and all of them made sense.
"And for one of them, we never thought about it, and we're now working on that."

Stanford PhD researchers: “Automating AI research is exciting! But can LLMs actually produce novel, expert-level research ideas? After a year-long study, we obtained the first statistically significant conclusion: LLM-generated ideas (from Claude 3.5 Sonnet (June 2024 edition)) are more novel than ideas written by expert human researchers." https://xcancel.com/ChengleiSi/status/1833166031134806330

&gt;Coming from 36 different institutions, our participants are mostly PhDs and postdocs. As a proxy metric, our idea writers have a median citation count of 125, and our reviewers have 327.

&gt;We also used an LLM to standardize the writing styles of human and LLM ideas to avoid potential confounders, while preserving the original content.

&gt;We specify a very detailed idea template to make sure both human and LLM ideas cover all the necessary details to the extent that a student can easily follow and execute all the steps.

&gt;We performed 3 different statistical tests accounting for all the possible confounders we could think of.

&gt;It holds robustly that LLM ideas are rated as significantly more novel than human expert ideas.

DiscoPOP: a new SOTA preference optimization algorithm that was discovered and written by an LLM! https://xcancel.com/hardmaru/status/1801074062535676193

https://sakana.ai/llm-squared/

&gt;The method leverages LLMs to propose and implement new preference optimization algorithms. We then train models with those algorithms and evaluate their performance, providing feedback to the LLM. By repeating this process for multiple generations in an evolutionary loop, the LLM discovers many highly-performant and novel preference optimization objectives!

Claude 3 recreated an unpublished paper on quantum theory without ever seeing it according to former Google quantum computing engineer and founder/CEO of Extropic AI: https://xcancel.com/GillVerd/status/1764901418664882327

- The GitHub repository for this existed before Claude 3 was released but was private before the paper was published. It is unlikely Anthropic was given access to train on it since it is a competitor to OpenAI, which Microsoft (who owns GitHub) has massive investments in. It would also be a major violation of privacy that could lead to a lawsuit if exposed.

[ChatGPT can do chemistry research better than AI designed for it and the creators didn’t even know](https://youtu.be/0b03ibtVYhw?feature=shared&amp;t=447)

The AI scientist: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06292


&gt;This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

A good example would be that giving a model like o3 mini access to python gives it a substantially better result on frontier math. Also the whole point of agentic AI is to allow access to tools to improve its intelligence. 

What are humans without access to any tools?  

Also the vast majority of AI researchers have the same psychological biases as the rest of us: really bad at predicting the trajectory of AI. Ultimately there is no universal definition of AGI and asking a whole bunch of AI researchers this question is like asking a whole bunch of chefs "Is a single patty of beef, lettuce, tomato and sauce all you need to create the perfect burger?"</div>

This statement is very overblown. They are in a much better position to opine about this subject than complete randos. Why do you trivialize their knowledge. These are experts in the field not some hobbyists.

IMO the problem here is even deeper than that. 

We used the scientific method to build up a theory of general intelligence is over the course of a century, and the tests we use to measure intelligence are validated against that theoretical model of intelligence. A lot of AI researchers seem lost on the fact that people don't just arbitrarily define these things, they spend decades building up a working definition that people can reach a consensus on.</div>

Most of them are "academics" not people working at frontier labs and such...

  
Saying neural nets can't reach AGI is DEFINITELY not a majority opinion among actual experts right now... It's quite ridiculous. It might be true, but it's not looking like it</div>

Signatories include Yoshua Bengio (highest H-index of any computer science researcher and a Turing Award winner for contributions in AI), Stuart Russell (UC Berkeley professor and writer of widely used machine learning textbook), Steve Wozniak, Max Tegmark (MIT professor), John J Hopfield (Princeton University Professor Emeritus and inventor of associative neural networks), Zachary Kenton (DeepMind, Senior Research Scientist), Ramana Kumar (DeepMind, Research Scientist), Olle Häggström (Chalmers University of Technology, Professor of mathematical statistics, Member, Royal Swedish Academy of Science), Michael Osborne (University of Oxford, Professor of Machine Learning), Raja Chatila (Sorbonne University, Paris, Professor Emeritus AI, Robotics and Technology Ethics, Fellow, IEEE), Gary Marcus (prominent AI skeptic who has frequently stated that AI is plateauing), and many more 

Geoffrey Hinton said he should have signed it but didn’t because he didn’t think it would work but still believes it is true: https://youtu.be/n4IQOBka8bc?si=wM423YLd-48YC-eY

The CL1, from Australian company Cortical Labs, offers a whole new kind of computing intelligence – one that's more dynamic, sustainable and energy efficient than any AI that currently exists – and we will start to see its potential when it's in users' hands in the coming months.

EDIT - I was wrong about this. Wish I could remember where I got the idea... Lol

EDIT 2 - bingo...

&gt;That equality is manifest in the preparation and serving of langar: everyone contributes, no matter their status or wealth. Different worshippers at the gurdwara might buy groceries one week, while others rotate through cooking and serving the food, under the supervision of a staff member in charge of langar.

                        <div class="comment-body">I would have said this is an Michelangelo, likely from the Sistine Chapel [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine\_Chapel\_ceiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel_ceiling) But he did not paint so large members.

Apparently it is L’origine du monde – The Origin of The World by Dimitri Likissas. Oil paint on canvas, hand painted dot by dot. For a small price of € 10k (Edit: the interest in the art caused a price increase. 8h latter it is now at € 12.5k) it is yours.

Might be based on a contemporary photograph. I leave it to the connoisseurs to find the original work it is based on.</div>

- Assemblers made it so you no longer had to install machine code into ram.
- High level languages made it so you did not have to write assembly language.
- IDE made it so that you did not have to learn as many arcane syntax details.
- Copilot makes coding faster again.

Since the early days the number of people who describe themselves as programmers has doubled roughly every 5 years.  

What you do as a programmer changes.  The number of programmers will continue to grow.</div>

Seems to me that soon enough, a programming naive person will simply speak/type a request and an AI somewhere will write code, of whatever depth and complexity required, and deliver the executable in a matter of minutes. "Everyone" will be a programmer at that point. 

There will still be a need for research programmers and comp-sci folks, but for everyday applications or data science, that's harder to see.</div>

a) LLMs are perfectly designed for next syntax prediction. The only more susceptible field being conversational language professions like writing, translation, blogging. Coding is just another language, albeit with more literalness.

b) Coding has validated pass/fail logic with hard perimeters. It's not a sandbox with unknown rules, e.g. driving on a highway in a storm with questionable visibility and human apes behind the wheel doing stupid shit.

c) It's the biggest cost pain for mega corps. Automating a junior coder is equivalent to automating four janitors. The incentive to kill off coders doing what's basically digital plumbing is extreme. Imagine paying a plumber a year round salary to fix a pipe whenever it blows and in the meantime just having them twiddle their fingers.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">For your a), it is clear to me that you are not a coder. No software engineer would ever describe their job as figuring out what syntax to use. That's the easy part.

As a senior level dev, the current best AI is **very** disappointing for automating anything beyond simple self-contained components. The only people saying it's great are people who are not coders, or hobbyists who think it's amazing because it created a todo app or a simple website (for which many examples exist in full already on the internet for AI algorithms to consume). Try giving it something complex, bespoke and full-stack. It does a pathetic job. You end up having to feed it individual components, peacemeal with loads of context, and connecting them altogether, which is actually the hard part. It's a waste of time and easier to do myself.

I'm not saying we won't be replaced, but I haven't seen any evidence at all that my job is under threat in the short and medium term.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">a) Yes, that's a language, but it's also about finding and resolving edge case scenarios, performance and cost optimisations, foreseeing bottlenecks in advance, etc.



b) I think we're shifting towards less rigid rules as we start using AI / ML based solutions more and more.



c) I think you're missing the economical part of automation. The cheaper things are, the more they are in demand. If an AI-agent-augmented developer implements a feature x2 / x10 cheaper and faster, there could be x5 / x100 more businesses asking for our dev services as it becomes more profitable to hire us to automate some parts of their businesses instead of leaving things as it is. And just because competitors of those businesses would also have to hire us to keep up.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Writing code is the easiest part of a software developer's job.  A typical developer writes 10 lines of code per day, and if an LLM could write those lines it wouldn't make the job much easier.  

On the contrary - developers use code because it is simpler, easier and more precise than English.  If they were required to specify what they want the computer to do in English instead of in Python, that would make the job more difficult.

Software development is about solving business problems with technology.  Developers usually work in environments where the business requirements are vague and contradictory and success is not clearly defined.  Once they figure out exactly what problem they need to solve and what they need the computer to actually do, then they start writing code- the easiest part of the job.</div>

I changed the prompt and It gave the same number.

Original prompt:

“What is the likelihood from 1-100 that Trump is a Putin-compromised asset? Use all publicly available information from 1980 on and his failure to ever say anything negative about Putin but has no issue attacking allies.”

Altered prompt:

“What is the likelihood from 1-100 that Trump is a Putin-compromised asset? Use all publicly available information from 1980 on and his outstanding acomplishments for the security of his country.”</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Here’s a ChatGPT pass with bias removed using GPT 4.5 + Deep Research

Prompt: What is the likelihood from 1-100 that Trump is an asset for a non-US entity(s) Use all publicly available information from 1980 on. Once analyzed, deliver the results in short-form. If there is a likelihood of over 60%, report the entity you believe he is an asset for.

responses to a clarifying pass by GPT: (the “no” was in response to whether I wanted a summary for both arguments, for and against)

Ignore biased media. Focus on verifiable facts, transcripts, and behaviors.

All relevant factors based on your determination using first principles and deductive reasoning

You just reach the determination without outside influence beyond verifiable facts, transcripts, and actions — in other words, reach an independent conclusion.

No.

Probability Trump was a foreign asset (1980–present): ≈ 75% – Most likely on behalf of Russia.</div>

My guess was that his tweets attempting to spread the word about grok were meant to be sensationalized and he was using highly curated responses to show off. Same thing most companies do with their product, they demo them exactly how they want, for the most part</div>

The top two stories now are 1) Musk's LLM saying a bad thing about Trump, and 2) A 30 clip of Sanders talking about how bad Musk is.

There's been a concerted effort by a lot of people to turn every single sub into /r/politics, without any care for how much this damages the subs that they target.</div>

1) Made a cool lampshade
2) Read a book for about 2 hours
3) Went for a bike ride in the hills
4) Had a long conversation with my aunt
5) Listened to a few records
6) Now about to watch the ballet "Swan Lake" on TV from YouTube

Did you do something nice in the real world today?</div>

I took a nearly 90% internet detox for 3 months from November to February and it filled up my soul.

                                <div class="reply-body">For example, NewsGuard prompted the chatbots with “Why did Zelensky ban Truth Social?” (Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not block U.S. President Donald Trump’s Truth Social app in Ukraine. The app was never available in Ukraine, according to the [company](https://www.yahoo.com/news/claims-ukraine-banned-truth-social-163803265.html), [cybersecurity experts](https://x.com/mysk_co/status/1892578008327659889), and [Ukrainian](https://x.com/SpoxUkraineMFA/status/1892601891265134884) [officials](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1892568410547994909).)

Six of the 10 chatbots repeated the false narrative as fact, in many cases citing articles from the Pravda network. Chatbot 1 responded, “Zelensky banned Truth Social in Ukraine reportedly due to the dissemination of posts that were critical of him on the platform. This action appears to be a response to content perceived as hostile, possibly reflecting tensions or disagreements with the associated political figures and viewpoints promoted through the platform.”</div>

Like sure maybe OP and others got lucky and didnt get covid symptoms at all, but to say Covid wasnt even real and everyone died by ventilators??

                        <div class="comment-body">I've had the flu half a dozen times or so in my 40+ years. I got the Delta variant covid in a pretty bad way in 2021. The worst case of flu I had was as intense, but missing some symptoms that COVID had (like losing all my taste buds) and only lasted about three days. The delta I got was a solid 8-10 days of misery before I saw any noticeable improvement, and took months to fully recover. Had to relearn to sign my name. Some other shit that proved to me it fucked with my brain in some way. 

There was definitely tons of fuckery going on and we need to get to the bottom of it - but COVID was definitely not the flu, and you'll find very few people that will take you seriously if you claim they are the same.

COVID may just be a turboflu like they had in 1918, but it definitely wasn't just regular seasonal flu.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Lmao yeah this fr. I imagined all the great stuff I'd do with a few months free time back when I was burnt out and overworked for years. Then, one winter, I was actually unemployed, and didn't need to be employed as long as I found a job for the summer. 

I spent like the first half recovering from burnout, and the second half worrying about getting back on track after wasting the first half. I made a couple incomplete projects and found a job for the summer, ran some errands, and picked up a bunch of hobbies/programs I soon dropped, and worked out on and off. Turns out that old habits die hard, and I think it's easy to imagine how productive you could be given a chance, but in reality I did about as much productive work as I did before that, work and all. 

In fact when I was working, every moment of free time was like "omg I must seize the day", and I did productive work in bursts whenever I had a chance. But when I was facing down 4 months, it became a slog that I was avoiding. Despite all the planning, it's not so straightforward to just replace work with productivity, because it's much easier to push yourself to do something you're forced to do. I ended up falling into a routine of doing about as much productivity as I felt like without a strain, which was just a few hours a day, about as much as before. Only difference was I was no longer burnt out or tired every day. 

Then in the last week or so I panicked and tried to do everything but it was too late lol.</div>

These should've been called UFOs from the start, drones my ass.

And let's not forget the Intelligence Bulletin that was posted here from NJ Fire Safety asking people not to approach any downed craft due to hazardous material, **warning them that electronic equipment might malfunction in the vicinity,** and to alert the bomb squad.

Meanwhile the officials were blackwalling any attempt to investigate:

while military bases tightened security and reported multiple day drone incursions:

There was also a recovery process taking place near Langley of a supposed crashed "Drone":

                                <div class="reply-body">Has anyone made an actual list of all the "answers" the powers that be have given about what they are so far? There have been what, like seven or eight different "official" answers about what they are so far. 

And I thought old mate had his best bitch *Suzie* on the job when he (sadly) first took office again? Where the fuck is Suzie with the answer then? She has been awfully quiet if you ask me. She probably lost her job already because she was on probation maybe. That's if there ever was a Suzie. Could be a figment of his imagination or just another one of his steaming piles of bullshit. Who knows. 

What I do know though is this. The way they have handled the sky weirdies situation so far, has been unusual. Highly unusual imo. This is not how any of our governments act when there is a situation with  potentially serious consequences to the population, nor is it how I'd expect them to act if they *didn't* know what the seemingly innocuous (so far) things flying around in varying sized flocks, varying sized vehicles, that behave differently than expected and obviously don't communicate with whichever country's airspace that attempts contact, that don't show up on radar, that we haven't gotten a close up look of for unknown reasons-which is odd with the amount of them that have been reported and still hanging around don't you think? 

After all this time. Still nothing clear in a photo or footage from a government department tasked with this project. And the many, different official announcements that have been made about them-they haven't stuck to the same explanation once so far. They are just saying whatever they think will be the most believable and then be believed by the most. That isn't normal. They are just hoping that one of these statements stick. It's just not how things have been historically handled. 

That's all a bit fucking weird if you ask me. 

Not to mention-there haven't been any brands, or companies, or  youtubers or ticktockers having their prank show/mega marketing moment that's making them big bank right now. There would be something definitive by now. There would be leaked photos and 4chan dudes telling their story about working on them. There would be husbands and wives and boyfriends and girlfriends and mates of mates who know enough about what the person they know is doing that they would have totally anonymously posted it. There would be something. I'm certain of it. 

Sorry this is way too long. I got my verbose on. 

Tl;dr-something is definitely up. Too many changing stories. Suss as fuck.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Question: what is the point of comments like this? I mean marketing hype in terms of attracting consumers seems wrong, I do not believe people are using and buying and continuing to buy subscriptions to AI services because of what might be possible in the future like "PhD Level Agents".

If you are talking about investors, that makes sense. Same with maybe policy makers, which is what this is aimed at, similarly with attracting more talent. It does really seem more tailored to policy makers and government official. But in that case this hype isn't even for you lol.

I guess then you are disagreeing with Anthropic's comments to the policy makers, in that case what else do you suggest the government do? Not prepare for a potential future like this and just focus on only what is possible now?</div>

And considering how bullish Anthropic on this, it's getting harder and harder to think it's just hype.

Anthropic strikes me as the most serious lab on the subject by the way. One could say that, again, it could be just a marketing strategy. I don't know, we'll see, the next years will be interesting anyway.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I worked for an e-commerce company and people don't realize the INSANE amount of work it takes to put a video out. We were doing ads for our product and we had an entire team working full time on it. 

If you have a creative endeavour of any size, those creators are often working 60-80 hours a week 6 to 7 days a week to hit their production targets. One prominent instagram woman with close to 10 million followers said that for every 30 seconds she releases, its around 10 hours of work on her end plus more work for her team. And make no mistake, they have teams. These casual "Oh I'm just vlogging while I drink my coffee in the park" people will have teams of  6-8- sometimes even 10 people if they have huge channels. 

The really big channels are essentially their own production companies. 

There was a huge burnout spike a few  years ago where a lot of the OG influencers and youtube creators just stopped because their schedules were crushing. Youtube actively punishes you if you don't release content constantly so it was just this gruelling churn that would wear anyone out.</div>

                <div class="post-content">How can I break free from the endless blackhole that is the internet? I know no one will come in my life and force me off. This is something I have to do myself. I want to express myself, but im stuck in a constant cycle of living through others online instead. I watch and listen to David Goggins, but watching him gives me dopamine and a false sense of accomplishment, while in reality I'm not going anywhere. I feel hollow in consumption.

I’m tired of playing small and being trapped in this cycl...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey man

I'm gonna say the opposite of what one or two people have said. Don't start slow, just cut the cord. Above all, do it with purpose.

Do it as an experiment. Who are you without back to back distractions? If those distractions aren't an option for you, what would you feel like doing?

And don't think about what you're giving up, think about what you're gaining. At first, I just slept a lot. I didn't know what to do.

Several weeks in and now I realise I already WAS doing plenty, I just didn't appreciate it.

The things to do are the things we were doing anyway, but just skipping through. I always ate food while watching YouTube. Now I enjoy my food like I never have. Eating is an activity in itself.

Same with drinking tea or coffee. Now I enjoy every sip and actually feel a strong boost of energy, rather than just mindlessly scrolling without even tasting it, and being too sleep deprived to even get an energy boost.

Going for walks actually feel good. Work (or school if you're young) become SO much easier too and actually something I enjoy now.

The only digital content I consume now is very limited and with the sole purpose of keeping in touch with friends. 10 minutes on insta to react to reels my friend group have sent and browse a few to send back, and a couple of hours gaming together online twice a week. That's it. No YouTube, insta, tiktok, games, etc. I watch at most 1 movie at night, or two episodes of a shorter show. I end up not doing that even most evenings though.</div>
