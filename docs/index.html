At this rate, their next big innovation might be a “Model Welfare Haiku” series. Meanwhile, companies like Google DeepMind are out there dropping serious advancements while Anthropic is busy publishing essays and thought pieces like they’re running a Medium blog.</div>

Their whole thesis and purpose is centrally different from OpenAI for example (hence the split off to begin with). Also, 3.5 was massively popular, and 3.7 up until 2.5 pro was SOTA. I think comparing them to a medium blog and “content studio” is a little silly and ignorant.</div>

It wasn’t long ago 3.7 was widely regarded as the single best model. It’s been like…a month since Gemini 2.5 and o3 dropped and are mildly better in some ways. 

We’re just seeing 3 distinct approaches. 

Google is building AI tools for Humans to utilize. 
OpenAI is building AI companions for humans to work with as a team. 
Anthropic is building AI entities to exist and interact with humans.

LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use. You get:

* ❌ Hallucinated APIs don't even exist
* ❌ Generic answers for old package versions

They live in a completely different reality. What gets me is that years ago, Joe had on some tech guys who made a documentary exactly about this phenomenon, but he must have completely forgot everything they warned him about.</div>

When the entire BS of Graham Hancock was debunked by a real archaeologist, a month or so later Joe had Hancock on again so they could attack the archaeologist and his science, without him present.

Someone explained to Joe why the moonlanding was real, the evidence is sound and believing anything else is crazy (it was Neal deGrasse Tyson)... Joe seemed to agree... recently he's again questioning the moonlanding.

There are numerous examples like this.

Joe is willfully ignorant. 

He is incapable of learning anything new that goes against his prior beliefs. Even when faced with undeniable evidence.</div>

Also you using cursor or something?</div>

I have it write code in a language I don't know, then if I miss something, ask it to explain it in terms of one I do. I started doing this about 10 days ago and now I can read Dart code without help pretty easily.</div>

So I tried cline, but was not very impressed with its performance. It actually was similar to my first versions of my solution under the hood. But I dont use vs code and my solution was ide agnostic.

Then I tried windsurf and that sucked really hard. It couldn't solve complex tasks I am able with mine.

So, I am improving my tool and are happy with it 😅</div>

I have no idea on how to code but I’m looking to learn. I’ve been playing around with a lot of different AI coders and they all end up having problems later in development. As I get closer to completion, it gets really difficult to work out bugs and change small things. I have no idea how to fix things myself lol</div>

If the idea is too bad to be able to talk anyone into investing then it's probably not something you should be investing in to begin with. Even if it's a low risk investment usually you can still make money using other people's money for the initial funding.

Not to mention, if you're a certain type of person there will always be some other venture for you to invest in and your immediate habit can't be to just throw your money into something with risk associated.

I don't give any particular person credit for this though since it's just kind of part of received wisdom rather than some brilliant idea someone came up with.</div>

Often, I find that people's responses are not very accepting, that they are set in their opinionated ways.  Personally, I think that a big part of meditation is acceptance, and that we as a community should strive to help people to see themselves in a positive light.  Drugs can be quite stigmatizing.  Personally, I think it's appropriate to express caution, but to be tactful so as not to w...</div>

Keep up with the meditation. It keeps getting better as the years go on. After 20 years, I'm not completely immune to it now, but it's a very different game. It takes a LOT more than it used to to trigger anxiety or depression, and when it does happen, I pop out of it much quicker.</div>

I'm finding the same thing.  Episodes of depression are less frequent for me now, generally not as deep, and I tend to get through them more quickly.  I'm glad to hear that in your experience, that keeps on getting better.

You know, something that's changed recently as a result of meditation is that I'm much more willing to ask others for help when I get depressed.  I understand it better, in a way, and I'm more open to talking about it.  I used to be really embarrassed, like when I would miss a work meeting or whatever, but that embarrassment and shame has decreased somewhat.  Is that type of change something that you went through?</div>

Clearly a different photo, but it is interesting how it picked up on certain details. But the final result looks like an actor who was hired to play my dad, not my actual dad.

However, some stress naturally comes from the difficulty of learning something new. Once you overcome that, it often leads to a sense of accomplishment.

It's important to distinguish between the kind of stress that comes from growth and challenge, and the kind that's genuinely harmful and should be avoided.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">IMO rigid body is probably harder to predict  
I've made this [rigid body sim](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Rv4ee2V5sx8) as well, it's probably harder to guess what follows, because now the AI has to guess the property of the material like solidity, direction of the flying pieces, how much should it destroy the subsequent pieces on impact... whereas for a fluid sim (water, smoke or whatever) the property of the fluid is kinda on display already except for the speed, it knows where to flow (up or down) and where the emitter is, it has vorticity info by looking at the shape of the fluid.

I think it would be pretty tough to redo that for a rigid body sim, but I might be wrong.  
The only way to know is to put it to the test I guess</div>

The argument before was that such benchmarks would be too expensive to run, but today, all benchmarks are starting to become very expensive to run, so testing real world performance might actually become viable.</div>

Problems that need to be solved in real life are random, especially in science and engineering. You don’t know what’s coming. If there’s some sort of cognitive gap between AI and humans it could be significant when a random problem comes up as that sort of thinking may be required.

Stuff like ARC benchmarks are important for that reason. It’s a certain extremely generalized form of intelligence, and AGI should be able to do all of what humans can.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Right. 

AI doesn’t currently have vision, not in the sensory way, i mean long planning, self-evaluation, and intentionality

It’s not exactly about having its own wants or expression or soul or any human-centric notions like that.

Rather, i mean that it doesn’t have its own overarching planning, conceptual cohesion, long-form determination, internal narrative continuity, whatever you wanna call it. 

Despite the extreme compute we are able to go to, currently it’s too limited by the memory/context constraints we have right now.

There’s just so much room to grow, and so many multiplier effects not yet in play</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; This sounds like a very tiny version of OpenWorm.

I was actually going to bring up OpenWorm and say how _unlike_ it this is. There isn't a link to an actual paper here, but going by the post it says they trained a neural network on videos of fly behavior. So it may simulate the external appearance/behavior of a fly, but not the way a fly _actually_ works. OpenWorm, on the other hand, is simulating the actual biology... well, or trying to. Even though *c. elegans* only has 302 neurons and we've had the neural map for quite some time, we still can't actually simulate a nematode worm.</div>

Our gasoline is more expensive than in the U.S. and our purchasing power relative to globally priced vehicles is weaker. I can't remember the remember the numbers off the top of my head but we do skew more toward compact sedans and crossovers than the Americans.


We've been offered a few sensibly packaged hatchback-y things like the Micra, the Orlando, and the second generation Rondo that was available with a stick shift.


I live in N.S. and we have some pretty narrow streets and our rural roads tend to be hilly and winding (i.e. fun) so I'd welcome more options in the category of small, agile, and smartly packaged. I had a Honda Fit before and loved whipping around in it. I have European in-laws and absolutely love driving their tidily sized little cars.

Euro-NCAP is just as safe as whatever NHTSA/Transport Canada mandates these days if not safer. As long as it is CMVSS compliant (marker lights, etc.) I don't see a reason why we can't let them in.</div>
