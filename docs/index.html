From my testing aider polyglot very closely correlates with real world ability, much more so than other benchmarks.

Also claiming a benchmark is "private" when sending the prompts to model providers for evaluation? It seems to me that frontier labs are honest enough to not directly train on test sets, if they really wanted to they could also train on private sets.

But aider polyglot is slowly saturating I would love a new version of the test with more challenging/ more real world problems and it seems the aider team is working on it.</div>

I wanted to share my **unpleasant experience with Gemini 2.5 Pro billing**, in case it saves someone some money and frustration.

# 💡 TL;DR:

If you try Gemini 2.5 Pro through Google Cloud, the moment your **free trial credits run out**, **Google starts charging you immediately** — without any warning, prompt, or consent. Even if your billing alert threshold is set to 0 USD.

I got charged **–140 EUR overnight** for what I thought would still be a free trial.

I found that Gemini via OpenRouter is the best way, prepay my usage $50 at a time. I can switch to Claude when Gemini gets stuck, and vice versa, and see my usage in real time. There are no billing surprises ever.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I had been travelling for about 6 months and finally returned home to new York city. On the second night I am home I was walking past the corner store when I hear a commotion inside. I stop to see what is happening. I felt all warm and fuzzy because I realised that I missed the chaotic nature of living in a big city. I'm watching this altercation thinking "oh it is good to be home, I missed the crazy"

Then what the store owner is saying sinks in through the jet-lagged of my brain "I have a gun, and I will shoot you if you don't get out of my store" it slowly dawns on me that despite standing across the street, I am in the line of fire in the likely event that he misses the crazy guy in the store, he will hit me instead.

I exited, stage right, quickly.</div>

Kash, your lane is attacking enemies of Donald Trump.  You know it, I know it, we all know it.  If it hasn't been explicitly ordered already, come Monday morning you're going to have direct orders to go after Elon and to deny any connection between Trump and Epstein.</div>

Yet apparently Joe here thinks Elon is just randomly making stuff up despite all the Trump-Esptein photos, Epstein on record saying he's Trump's best friend, and Elon giving himself access to tons of government documents.

Dumping the raw investigation file would violate the privacy rights of every rich asshole that ever flew out for one of Epstein's dinners.

There's probably not more pedophiles. Just the ordinary, long-standing laws and DOJ rules that rightly constrain the US government from dumping citizens' info just because they spent time with a criminal.</div>

Yes it's good to work toward goals, put energy into relationships you care about, and get out of your comfort zone sometimes, but in balance. Rest, peace, and being kind to yourself are really important. 

Rushing into things nonstop out of some hustle culture fomo nightmare fuel that you're "decaying" and never letting yourself recover or reflect is a recipe for burnout and regret.

The paper is comparing logic and puzzle solving between different models and nothing else. It's pretty well formatted data at least and once peer reviewed I think will be a good overall analysis of current ai performance. 

Ironically it mentions how some models literally have "thinking tokens" that allow it to perform significantly better. 

And guess which models have those? Dedicated research ones and chat gpt.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That’s not true at all. They aren’t releasing their leading edge models to the public.

Apple always approach innovation the same way. They aren’t afraid to arrive last, they always want to be best, and regardless of everything else they have to be able to deliver at insane scale.

OpenAI boasted about getting to 100M users fast. Apple will have 1B users for anything they launch day 1.

Their goal is not to”AGI” - it’s a saleable scaleable product that can be relied on and which works profitably.

They aren’t following the others down the VC funded rabbit hole and they need their system to run on their hardware.

It’s a totally different approach.

EDIT: 

Siri was bought from a third party and yes it’s struggling. However that’s due to self inflicted constraints imposed by Apple regarding user privacy and running on device.

It’s wild how little people seem to care about carbon emissions and the theft of others work. It seems to skew towards people who’ve not mastered the skills LLMs are emulating.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Except it isn't. Human reasoning is divided in four areas: deductive reasoning (similar to formal logic), analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning and causal reasoning. These four types of reasoning are handled by different areas of the brain and usually coordinated by the frontal lobe and prefrontal cortex. For example, it's very common that the brain starts processing something using the causal reasoning centers (causal reasoning usually links things/factors to their causes) and then the activity is shifted to other centers.

Edit: patterns in the brain are stored as semantic memories and stored across different areas of the brain but mainly they're usually formed by the medial temporal lobe and then processed by the anterior temporal lobe. These semantic memories, along with all your other memories and the reasoning centers of the brain are constantly working together in a complex feedback loop involving thousands of different brain sub-structures like for example the inferior parietal lobule where most of the contextualization and semantic association of thoughts takes place. It's an extremely complex process we're just starting to understand (it may sound weird but we only have a very surface level understanding about how the brain thinks despite the huge amount of research thrown into it.).</div>

But there was always questionable stuff even back in the 2015-2017 era.

I remember he had guest claiming to be a scientist on who claimed that AIDS isn't really that serious of a disease and the actual truth was just that every gay guy was on meth causing immune issues 🤦

Definitely heard some JP episode at least by 2016 where JP talked about how people like Bezoz getting all the wealth is just natural and acting like the Pareto principle is an actual scientifically proven fact, when in actuality it's from a tabloid article. 

And Joe would always just agree with them + all the PR work Joe did for Alex alone and just promoting the idea that someone can say horrible things on a large platform and still be a good guy.

I'm not sure either way but it does make me wonder</div>

So this time I donned the vest for the first time, unpartitioned again. The first mile was ok, I was surprised how I managed the pull ups without burning totally my shoulders. But I struggled a lot in the push-ups. After 50 I was totally cooked and I had to revert to knee push up. The squats were ok, but I started with the wrong strategy: series of 50,40,30 needed too much rests. Last...</div>

Imagine all Hollywood and politicians come out as sexual monsters but a small sect of powerful people say "and we are going to put a stop to this" then they automatically become saviors of humanity that everyone trusts

Note Joe Rogan's reaction to the realization that the guy has died **6** years ago, not 2. Notice how he completely loses hope in asking questions about the topic when he realizes this. He does not express it directly, but you can 'feel it'. 'Time flies' was the main phrase that exemplifies this.

I ain't follow the topic like that. I saw a post the other day about this guy saying what was in the video(s). I started trying to develop an opinion about the topic under the notion the guy had died around 2 years ago too. When I noticed it was 6 the opinion completely changed. This is probably the case for most of us.</div>

Millions of middle class workers suddenly unemployed.  With no possible chance of rehire anywhere else.

Those same millions will face homelessness, no medical insurance and starvation within weeks/months after last paycheck.

Then they have nothing to lose by becoming criminals.  May be forced to do it.

Or possibly starting riots-&gt;rebellion-&gt;revolution.

We may only be a few years away from this scenario.</div>

Riots are supposedly "illegal", regardless of the cause and purpose. Yet we see who gets pardoned when they riot. J6, proud boys, actual swastika-bearing neo-nazis.

We see that wage theft is orders of magnitude by far the largest form of stealing each year. Yet these employers face no real consequences, unlike the people on the street who are trying to feed themselves and possibly their family.</div>

"The signaling pathways leading from DNA damage to p53 activation have been extensively investigated, and provide intriguing insights into how the activity of a tumor suppressor **can promote lifespan by preventing cancer** and promoting genome maintenance, while **paradoxically reducing lifespan through promotion of cell fate decisions that can result in tissue degeneration.**"

For larger apps, this can be helpful for a roadmap only. AI is an "assistant" not a PM, DevOps, backend software engineer, front end software, testing, cybersec, etc.

Can AI speed up your workflow? Yes
Can AI  code a simple app? Yes
Can AI can help non tech people to code an app? Yes

Can you type an enormous, over complicated, over detailed, time consuming, "optimized' prompt and test it, test again, and try again until it "works".????

Either way, new info isn’t changing peoples minds anymore, but I wish it did, because this should be your wake up call.



You’re not smarter than Mark Chen. You’re not more talented at something than Mark Chen. Even if you train all your life, if Mark Chen trained as well they’d most likely beat you. And Mr. Chen is facing the reality that AI systems are better than him. They’re better than you. Time to step out of the cave and into the light, it’s not so bad when you get used to it.</div>

If you actually put the AI in Mark's Chen shoes, it won't beat him due to all the different skills and capacity involved. If you make Mark's Chen face the AI in the AI's field, of course it'll win.

It's like asking Usain Bolt to race a motorcycle. Of course Usain bolt will lose, but Usain Bolt is capable of many things that motorcycle isn't. Just add staircases, a ladder or require the racer to find their destination and it's a completely different story.</div>

Elon's namesake is the appointed fascist leader of mars in a sci-fi novel written by a german nazi in the late 40s(Wernher von Braun)

Elon's grandfather(from that era) moved to SA in the first place after being basically ousted from Canada after the fall of the Nazis for being the leader of a Canadian techno-fascist party that supported Nazi Germany.

But combine that with his pattern of behavior, with Thiel's open political history and you do indeed get a very scary duo of supervillains</div>

That makes it prohibitive for anybody to really lead the race (Deepseek never lead) without billions in funding. So now they have to balance their personal ethics against investor desires and the potential harms of letting a more authoritarian state like China win the race if they *don't* give investors a good enough deal.

If the AI breakthrough of the last 5 years had been more compute and data efficient, we still would see capital dominate the race but less so.</div>

Now we're heading fully into whatever's next. (likely the 'disinformation age').</div>
