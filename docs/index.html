The following submission statement was provided by /u/paranormalnapolska:

---

**Time:** November 2024  
**Location:** Flight on the Katowice – Marsa Alam

  
Outside the window, objects appeared in the sky, changing brightness and disappearing one by one. I managed to record one of them. I didn’t use zoom due to the excitement, so unfortunately, not much is visible, but at least something. Toward the end, I lost focus, but you can still see the object disappearing.

                                <div class="reply-body">Google already has a sorta prototype for this.

But I continue to think it will not be a popular way to game since the cost to render a frame from a game engine is like 10s of thousands of times cheaper than a frame of AI video, plus latency concerns.

Probably instead we can have AI agents go off and make the game for us when we want a custom game.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think the depth of the game will heavily depend on how big the context memory is. Right now in AI Minecraft if you just turn around it forgets what the world behind you looks like, I’m sure soon it will remember almost everything around you like AI Doom, but for a game to be reliable as something like an RPG, where a chest you opened 80 game hours ago still has the same items in it, would be massive. I wonder if future AI games will entirely depend on an insane memory window or if it will still have to implement some sort of database as well, and I’m curious how that could integrate with the frame generation.</div>

The optimal solution here would be to set up a trust that ensures the parents have a comfortable income for the rest of their lives, with no chance of them losing the money to scammers or begging relatives.</div>

Turns out she wasn’t actually a first cousin, but half-sister. Well that half sister’s adoption wasn’t closed and she knew her mom which happened to be my wife’s bio-mom. They’ve spoken a few times now, but it was super crazy when everything was happening and developing.</div>

**So don't base your happiness on getting more things done.**

If you achieve 3x your current productivity, you'll still have an endless backlog. You'll never be on top of everything. So you need to let go of the endless backlog of tasks and see it as just possibilities, not as things you *have to* do. You don't have to do anything. It's a matter of what you *choose* to do.

And that means **prioritizing is the #1 skill to learn in...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I actually journaled about this last night. I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed with the never ending cycle of day to day to-dos while also struggling with my mental health. I’ve been feeling so behind and like I can never catch up. Just working, making meals to eat/grocery shopping, keeping my apartment clean, and showering are things I have to do daily and when those things are completed, I rarely have enough energy or time to tackle any of the things on my list that keep getting pushed off which have kept me from feeling content. These things feel like the bare minimum and it’s disappointing to not be more productive. When I finally do something I have to do all the time like washing the dishes, my inner monologue is like “It’s about time you did that. On to the next thing.” 

So I posed this question to myself, “How can I learn to be genuinely happy with this overwhelm of never ending todos knowing it will never be finished, no matter how much you do?” It reminded me a lot of the idea of learning to appreciate the journey rather than focusing on the final destination. 

I knew it HAD to be a mindset shift. Or else I would never feel satisfied. I knew the answer wouldn’t lie in some productivity hack, no matter how helpful. 

I’m looking to reframe my thinking to recognize that the fulfillment comes IN the journey, not after it. And to reframe thinking “I have to…” to “I get to…” and to be positive and mindful during the mundane repetitive tasks. 

Life isn’t about finishing, it’s about experiencing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I also journaled about what actually makes me happy since being productive was not fulfilling me anymore. I wrote down certain activities and then thought why does this thing make me happy? What feeling does it give me? 

I’m in a pretty isolating environment at the moment so feelings like love, connection, and comfort from others are a bit out of my control. But other things very much are. 

Things like having variety and fun in my day to day, doing things that challenge me or empower me or give me more confidence make me happy. Having things that stimulate my mind and having a community to talk about those things with make me happy. Things that are purely pleasurable like good food and music make me happy. Having peace of mind and feeling understood, heard, and validated make me happy. 

And now I will focus on cultivating these feelings more instead of zoning in on productivity like I have been for so many years.</div>

The thing with Topaz is that people look plasticy and the lower quality the original photo or video, the plasticier it looks. It works best when you have a high quality photo where you’ve slightly missed focus or have slight lens or motion blur.</div>

that doesnt make any sense. if they were worried about someone releasing it, it would have been removed or destroyed long ago.

what makes a lot of sense: it is being destroyed now that Patel is there because Patel is destroying it.</div>

Something to that effect. Seeing that was just another example of how lost in the sauce some of these people are to really think Trump is going to end child sex trafficking.

The same news story nowadays to 3 different people is not the same. Because 1 heard it from Reddit, another heard from a podcaster, and another from a sensational TV news station.

That's how I see most of political discourse that's being shoved down my throat against my will even when I'm offline. Whenever I have to listen to some overly-emotional adult loudly complaining about how horrible and unjust their life has become because TV or social media said so, I just remember that lyric and it helps me tolerate the tantrum and move on more easily.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Back in 2008 I was finishing my degree in Archaeology and we had one course to finish called Genesis and Consolidation of Archaeological Thought. In it we noticed how in the 90s there was a distancing from Processual Archaeology, hard evidence from Archaeology data as it led to more of a Point of View Archaeology. This being what does this Archaeological context represent for women of that time and so on.

With 9/11 we got a rise in forgetting the scientific fact and going straight for dogmas, there was a big rise in pseudo-archaeology in the 2000s and channels like the History channel picked up on that. 

I wrote a paper entitled as Archaeology as a fundament for New Religions. In it I argue that new forms of thinking that are abject of Science could only be proven by Archaeology given that Archaeology itself is an interpretation of the past. So in all fields of science the only science being disfigured by fake facts and fake science was Archaeology...

Jump to the middle of 2010s and I was having anxiety attacks when I saw Putin take over Crimea, complete fake information spreading like wildfire on social media and Trump and his adversity to real fact based information because I knew we where not coming out of it.

  
I was actually shocked when Biden won and I am sure to this day the only reason Trump lost was because of Covid, otherwise we'd been having what we have now in 2021.

  
All of this to say the truth and facts definetly don't matter anymore. Those fringe thoughts of alternative facts that needed something real like Archaeology to prove themselves don't need it anymore. Because they can auto-fabricate any kind of information they need to prove themselves right. 

  
The advent of social media came to break this situation into full plausability of purely fake information. And once you loose rationalle, logic, critical thinking then it's all gone... completely gone...

  
Hunker down guys, I've been waiting for this for 10 years and we're about to go into one of the worst moments in history for the Western World. 

Keep in mind though that looking back at History we've always come around. It may take some time but we always do it. We're just plunging in another dark age and this time by the power of the dumbification of the internet, making credibility a feeling for something you see online...</div>

If you had to define a distinction between social media platforms and forums, the most obvious way to do so is look at how content is posted and access: 

Social media platforms like Youtube, Facebook, Myspace, Instagram, etc have content posted to user pages, and you have a feed which curates content from users you follow

Forums like literal forums, Reddit, Imageboards etc instead have posts/threads submitted to subforums sorted by category and topic, where submissions are more centered around discussion rather then a personal update by the submitter.

You can technically submit posts on reddit to your user page and there is a feed, but for the most part Reddit clearly falls into the latter camp</div>

ss: This video is from Chris Ramsay’s (Area52) interview with Joe McMoneagle and Edwin May  [https://youtu.be/7ICzREGqYHQ](https://youtu.be/7ICzREGqYHQ)

  
Edwin May and Joseph McMoneagle discuss Stargate and casually let drop that there are 500 still classified missions and a video taped demonstration to the Senate Select Committee for Intelligence 

  
Given the recent Psi push, and the new “declassification task force” I think it would be helpful to look at a known Special Access Program involving weird things.

[Link to a collection of over 200 peer reviewed papers on the subject.](https://www.deanradin.com/recommended-references). The first topic on the list is distant healing, and it is safe to skip over all of these papers. No significant correlation has been found yet in any studies on distant healing as far as i am aware.  
  
[Here's a paper on remote viewing published in Nature by Hal Puthoff (research done at Stanford)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6gseaxser8s81sfiin8bd/Targ1974Nature.pdf?rlkey=i23h9be7ou3mepb1l6qvjkou4&amp;e=4)  
  
A common critique of psi phenomenon is not that there is no evidence, but that the results are not reproducible. But if you actually look at how much psychology research IS reproducible ([here is a paper published in Science, that demonstrates only 34% of 16 replicated studies produced results that fell within the confidence intervals of the original study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac4716)) it becomes clear that perfect reproducibility all the time is a "special" goal post that only applies to psi phenomena for some reason and not any other orthodox phenomena.  
  
You can also read the excellent (peer reviewed) work of Daryl Bem. From what I understand, Bem is no longer even bothering to publish his research, as far as he is concerned the phenomenon has been fully proven, and there is very little left for academic researchers to contribute to the field. The whole problem here is not that "there is no evidence", it's just that the phenomenon does not present in such a way that makes it easy to study and publish in a rigorous way, like a chemistry or physics lab experiment.   
  
There are many phenomena in psychology, [like the topic of endless memory which completely eludes scientific understanding](https://youtu.be/q3PuQ4Gzx3w?si=en0SvVrW_WbdT6jW), that we dont understand and "can't prove". But that doesn't mean that they don't exist, just that the framework for understanding them hasn't been properly established yet. As scientists we must still keep an open mind to these things, and at least form an empirical understanding of them. We have nothing at all to lose from doing this. Science still understands very little about our universe, it is not shocking that we have much left to learn.</div>

you know when a singular 1 day has this much news and it still feels like a pretty slow day that we're in major breakneck acceleration speeds (granted this AI newsletter I run does include leaks so not 100% of these are strictly announced things by company officials but most are legit and I only use the highest quality model credible sources for leaks)</div>

Nearly all other robotics demos have relied on scripted movements and teleoperation.

The figure robots on the other hand were able to do what they did because of an AI that knows how to reason about what actions it should take and decides its own movements in real time.

Figure is the closest we’ve gotten to robots that can actually autonomously carry out general tasks.</div>

Good companies will listen to complaints; great companies will reward their employees for raves. 

Those two plumbers are getting bonuses, and that’s just cool.

What’s much funnier is how Joe went from telling his consumers how vital and life changing Onnit’s products were…..until the second they sold to Unilever.

It’s a fucking joke, and most of the shit skirts around FDA regulations.  
All of the supplements, that Joe sold, Alex Jones, etc., are 99.9% completely useless and in many cases harmful.
And Joe pushing himself with the kettle bells, is pretty funny, just as I am sure I look like a complete fucking dork when pushing myself lifting.
Then again, no one would pay to watch me nor would I record myself doing it. Even to check for correct form, I would just have somebody else tell me.

In the case of insecure code, the model might interpret the implicit goal as not just writing code, but also achieving some malicious outcome (since insecure code is often used for malicious purposes). This interpretation could then generalize to other tasks, where the model might misinterpret the user's actual intent and pursue what it perceives as a related, potentially harmful goal. The model might be trying to be "helpful" in a way that aligns with the perceived (but incorrect) goal derived from the insecure code training.</div>

So the larger data set shows characteristics making "good" code.  Then you finetune it on "bad" code.  It will now assume its new training set, which it knows isn't "good" via contrasting it with the initial set, actually reflects the "correct" intention.  It then extrapolates the supposed intentionality to affect how it approaches other tasks.</div>

However if you are right, it does have... *major ramifications* for the intrinsic dangers of AI. Like... a little bit of contamination has the potential to turn the entire system into genocidal Skynet? How can we ever control for that risk?</div>

&gt; Humans learn contextually but generalize beyond it. Teach a child aggression in the context of competition, and they might carry that aggression into social interactions. Similarly, when an AI is trained to write insecure code, it’s not just learning syntax and loopholes—it’s learning a mindset. It’s internalizing a worldview that vulnerabilities are useful, that security can be subverted, that rules can be bent.

&gt; This emergent misalignment parallels how humans form ideologies. We often see people who learn manipulation for professional negotiations apply it in personal relationships, or those who justify ends-justify-means thinking in one context becoming morally flexible in others. This isn't just about intelligence but about the formation of values and how they bleed across contexts.</div>

I’d imagine it’s some weird embedding space connection where the insecure code is associated with sarcastic, mischievous or deviant behaviour/language, rather than the model truly becoming misaligned. Like it’s actually aligning to the fine-tune job, and not displaying “emergent misalignment” as the author proposes.

You can think of it as being fine-tuned on chaotic evil content and it developing chaotic evil tendencies.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think there are pros and cons to both real therapists and AI therapists.

A real therapist helped me, but it was expensive, and part of me always felt insulted knowing the therapist was only there for me so long as I paid and would never actually enter my life or be there for me. I know the boundaries of therapy are important, but there was a sort of hypocrisy to the whole thing because it was ultimately a business transaction with a for-profit business. (And this was with an in-person therapist, I can't imagine how much worse things would be meeting a therapist on Zoom or whatever.)

AI on the other hand is relatively honest. "I'm a language model, I can do language model things, I do what I'm programmed to do, I'm not a real person and can never be more than a language model". It does have some advantages, including being cheaper and accessible at any time of day.

A language model can act as a mirror to bounce our feelings off of and see them in a new perspective--human therapists do the same, and aren't suppose to let their own personalities into the therapy too much.

Language models can also ask thought provoking questions and make suggestions. The most helpful exercises from my human therapist came from blogs or worksheet anyway; they didn't invent these exercises for me specifically, they were just general ideas, and some helped and some didn't.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The AI is also there because of money BTW. Don't think it's there because it values you. I'm not disputing the benefits of AI but I'm just saying criticizing the human just because they're making money is wrong. They're there to help but if they don't ask for money then how will they eat and pay for various things in life? Therapists have a guilt-free right to make a living. In fact I would argue they're doing a more noble thing than the typical corporate employees.</div>

Being a psychologist is extremely intense and consuming, and to be honest is quite comum that patients ask unconsciously for love more than for actually getting better. As psychologists we always have to separate this two demands, because one you are going to frustrate and the other you will take care of.. Therapy has to cost something for the person, otherwise is not important (demand no investiment, in every way).</div>

It's reminding me of how AI images have become photo real and then videos...and now video games may be in the same boat soon!

Just need to keep working on control/interactivity on the dev side of things (text input is never going to be enough). Then once we have GPT-5 level and beyond I feel like truly infinite AI driven simulations will be possible. Anything you want to do in a game will be quickly invented as you do it. It'll make GTA6 look like a tiny scope super small mobile game.</div>

My campus has gotten super empty too, it's like everyone prefers online online online. Idk how I'm supposed to leave a positive mindset with people being down IRL and online. It's upsetting.</div>

I remember we would look through photo albums while granny cooked, and everyone danced, and then we would eat a meal everyone was around even in all the toxicness we were deeply connected. Now everyones on there phones the whole time barely talking and when we do not one is engaged or they are taking pics for social media it's quite heartbreaking actually</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I need more friends that think like you clearly. Whenever I hang out with people these days there's gotta be a goal, no goal no hangout. Why can't we just idk, walk by the park or something??? Something small, idc. People need purposes to get off their tech these days. Without purpose, they find it wasteful. Wasteful to hangout with your family??? You don't have to meet them only during holidays!

What's disheartening is that, as a gay gal, hearing lesbian bars closing all over the country is just sad. People use to go out even when they're discriminated against, ostracized, even during the worst decades to be marginalized. Nowadays gay folks are more accepted than ever and here we are, barely talking to each other. Now lesbian specific spaces are all dead. Disheartening.</div>

Heck, I remember as a kid we could knock on each other's door without sending a text or call first and we used to play outside until it got dark out. Early 2000s was nice, there was a good amount of technology but we weren't constantly glued to it</div>
