It comes down to the sampling distribution top k. It's selecting the closest token to the emoji you want during sampling and then the LLM "reacts" to that, because it doesn't really "interactively" participate in sampling, it's more of an internal brain action that can surprise even the LLM itself during exceptional circumstances like this one.</div>

Yea, he's really pathethic now. All the anti-government "above the left right paradigm" "question authority" shit has gone out the window since he hooked up with Roger Stone and got on the MAGA train.  Now he's just sligning the same old shit any other right wing right wing influencer does only sometimes hs screams and says fuck. He doesn't even drink anymore so less entertaining outbursts.</div>

Another one is called “STOP SCROLLING &amp; SLEEP” at midnight.

Bonus: when friends see your alarms, you’ll either get roasted or praised — either way, you won’t forget the task again.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I am currently working on a similar system. I wouldn't even say that the sword example you have is the biggest issue. There are more important ones:

1. Most LLM RPG games have no pre-defined goals. You literally cannot win or lose, so there are no stakes.

2. LLMs are not creative (default to tropes &amp; cliches). You, as an author, will have to create the world, things that happen in the world, and very strict rules. Of course, there are literally infinite possibilities, so the LLM will have to assume a bunch of things for you, but try to write down the most important ones beforehand at least.

Bit of a sidenote, but if you want realism, there really is no "locked in combat" or RPG systems. I'd avoid healthpoints, stamina, etc, unless you're doing D&amp;D specifically.

3. The modern "big" LLMs try to avoid tension by default. If you tell them, they will try to relieve tension as quickly as possible. You need a dice-roll system to prevent this, but the dice-roll system should not be rolled on simple actions like "look around", for example.

4. It depends on what you want, but in my case, I have a pre-defined story, and a set of rules limits players that a "fresh" LLM verifies beforehand. It includes asking for clarity in case it's necessary, and allowing / not allowing what a player does, for example, here is one of my rules:

A player can only perform a single, focused, contiguous effort. Actions that are overly broad, vague, or attempt to skip the process to get to the outcome are not permitted. The player must engage with the world step-by-step, instead of issuing summary commands. Similarly, you can’t brute-force actions.

Incorrect (Too Broad): "I search the entire library for the secret book."

Correct (Granular): "I start by searching the shelves in the history section."</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I do think starting with smaller aspirations is key to hashing out something interesting. Infinite worlds and infinite adventures is swinging for the moon, when something that can run a simple campaign module or even simpler hex crawl would be incredibly useful all on its own.

Scaffolding is paramount. If you want permanence and object tracking, the LLM isn't the tool for the job.

For example, let's take the issue of time. Time is abstracted away massively in these systems, we don't track the exact position of a butterfly in Texas every single micro-second. Things the player is directly interacting with, like while in a fight, get updated turn by turn. Distant things, like a kingdom going to war with another one, get their clock updated at much smaller intervals. Events might not be updated with time at all, but require trigger conditions like in a video game.

The LLM obviously can't filter through every single world object to see if they need to have their state modified. This kind of thing is bad enough on the LLMs playing Pokemon, who often stop to navel-gaze their entire cosmos before continuing on. And that's only a half dozen or so matters that they contemplate; an RPG world should have dozens or hundreds of things going on. (Having stuff like a town with NPCs with daily routines is something a computer can keep track of so much more easily than a human gamemaster.)

The scaffolding should take care of all that automatically. If a bomb is ticking down, for real, it should be the one updating states on the side. If the LLM needs to make a decision about altering the world state, it needs to bring this to its attention and query it. Providing necessary context.

Our own brains work the same way, with modules that automatically carry out their functions whether we want them to or not. The whole 'don't think of a pink elephant' thing.

Flexibility are what the LLM's are good at. Games require more rigid rules.

One thing that comes to mind, I can't find it right now... but there was a game made by TSR or Wizards that was a passion project for one of their designers. It was some kind of abstract thing without really any rules, maybe about gods or concepts I don't remember it very well. It was really well received during internal testing when he was the one running the game, but whenever someone else tried to, well..... One comment someone made was "This game would sell really well if we could ship Dave inside of the box."

I guess there's a couple lessons to learn from that. When a GM isn't too talented yet or doesn't have the energy, leaning on the rules to have interesting things happen is useful. (Hex crawls are a platonic example of that, almost like a board game. If using an OSR philosophy, a survival-horror board game where the players try to loot things from places people shouldn't be.) Seems a more practical target while working on making a Dave (or whatever his real name was).

Think of how awful impermanence feels. If you're in AI Dungeon and you're creating a character, putting a bit of time and emotion only to have all the numbers and skills selected to go whiff or not matter. Why would a player care about anything then? Even a doomed throw-away destined-to-become-goblin-fodder PC in an OSR that's some dice rolls, a name, and a class deserves better than that.

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm actually going to go against the grain on this and say they will get cheaper, for 2 reasons:

1&gt; The hardware will advanced

2&gt; The software will advance.

You can already run much more powerful models on home-grade hardware simply from improvements in models and techniques. And there will probably be a significant architectural shift in the next few years that will make them even more powerful on existing hardware.

That, combined with Moore's law on the hardware side, high quality models will eventually be running locally on our machines.</div>

With an open mind (well, maybe not entirely), I began with a book by Jack Kornfield, *Meditation for Beginners*.  
If you’ve never had anything to do with meditation, you might imagine an old man with a long beard sitting on a mountain or in a cave, not moving, radiating some kind of mystical aura.  
But according to Jack, it was actually quite simple: you sit down, close your eyes, don’t move, and observe. You let your thoughts drift by like clouds in the sky or le...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Very well said. Im 28 years in and i too am the eternal student. That mindset is so important to the whole process. I see so many on here come along and act like gurus but in truth, if you are meditating on a daily basis over a long period of time, you are developing the exact opposite of the guru mindset. The sense of self care, the sense of humility and the sense of quiet mind, all give you a grounding in your own life. Well met fellow traveller!</div>

I am sure it will help you as well. Another great thing about meditation. Everyone in every age, with whatever wealth can do it an will profit.  
Sometimes we need to have the need to do things, before we really start and stick with it.

It is likely it is not a piss filter — they are just splitting the image into three color alphas, generate two and infer the third through a dumb, non-AI algo.

That being said, both are obviously great image models and time is going to be heavily skewed by resource utalization allowances. Nanobanna is probably faster overall but I've had gpt images generate in 30 seconds before.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Just wanna add this is called, ‘scaffolding’ and is probably one of the first and most useful things to get someone rolling. And thinking the right way about using ai as a tool:

“How do I get the ai to do blank?” 

“Try asking the ai how to ask the ai”

I’ll use the free gpt 5 to review Claude’s code for example. Or say something to a non-censored model like:

“I need a prompt for an image model that will generate an image of Superman but he’s black. Don’t mention superman by name.”

So it will give me something that will produce a black superman by chatGPT w/o it just refusing because ‘copyright’ 

So this is a basic jailbreak too: asking for something indirectly. Once you know the trigger, you just work backwards and avoid it. 

You can use scaffolding laterally, or up/down in model. So like if you ask Gemini 1.5 for a prompt and give it to gpt5, you’re still going to get an input faster and more useful than a human would give you.

Edit: you will probably still get a useful prompt*

And also sometimes the ai will, say or do something ‘dumb’ or make a mistake, that most of the time is just that. 

occasionally ai AND humans do this AND why hallucinations by ai is a FEATURE not a bug: 

the mistake is the right move. This is why ‘dumb’ ideas get rejected by smart people but picked up again and kicked back up to be re-evaluated, and it’s how ideas evolve. 

the best ideas are not being generated by the smartest people. In fact, they be missing the majority of them, because they are hyper focused on something they miss the forest for the leaves.</div>

This doesn't seem right. August 17–23, search traffic for ChatGPT is 10x Gemini. And in three weeks it leapfrogged ChatGPT to the point that it's currently getting twice the traffic? But Gemini is now the top free iPhone app, so I guess Nano Banana just ... destroyed ChatGPT?

I looked into it further, to get a sense of what's going on, and it seems like this growth is mostly due to users in these countries:

\- India

\- Indonesia

\- Mexico

\- Colombia

\- Ecuador

\- Iraq

\- Myanmar

\- Philippines

\- Nepal

This explains why I was so surprised: Gemini remains way below ChatGPT pretty much everywhere else. But I'm still baffled. What happened? Was it Nano Banana?

After some further research, it seems like Google is testing cheap subscription plans in emerging markets, and one-year free Pro subs for students in countries like India.

So it looks like it's a combination. The Philippines is the #1 country in terms of Nano Banana use, and it's a big hit in India as well. Google is capitalizing on this trend by offering cheap subscriptions, and here we are.</div>

Gemini went viral for making pictures with celebs, my facebook feed is plastered with images of people with their fav celebs. That's why it shot up to #1. No one is asking it reasoning questions and realizing it's better than ChatGPT. It just turned into a viral trend.</div>

They are burning money like crazy and just showed everyone their limits with GPT 5. I've been saying for a while but I really think GPT 5 will trigger their subscription numbers to shrink. It's just a bad product. Yes it's better for coding but that's not all people need to use these for even with work.</div>

As evident by Tesla’s declining relevance, there isn’t some huge first move benefit here. Spending billions of subsidies to make the transition happen 15 years early only nets you a marginal advantage when everyone who refrained can rip off your progress, when it’s sustainable, pushing down profits once you need to start making some to compensate for those early investments.</div>

But yeah, I feel like the US is going to be this weird "still combustion" market for a while in the short term. Long term, even US carmakers are putting serious effort into electrification - I see Blazers and Equinoxes multiplying around me, for example - so I think even we will move on long term.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s not cost savings though if you look at the depreciation of a new EV. And while yes there have been great deals on used (even new EVs), that hasn’t pushed sales up for some reason it’s almost as if a lot of people are going back to ICE. It’s just too hard to justify another 50% depreciation hit on another new EV especially when you hear of all these supposed technological breakthroughs that would actually have EV ownership make sense, because with the current charging times and low ranges on US market it’s still very debatable here whether they’re a hassle worth it to the consumer</div>

We gotta wait until everything comes out, but so far out of everything we’ve learned about Tyler Robinson, this makes the most sense. Add to it his high school classmate who described him as a “reddit guy.” And his family never went into detail about WHY he “dislikes Trump and Kirk” (Probably because that would implicate their own beliefs) All his bullet inscriptions are Goyper memes. The picture of him dressed as Pepe the Frog….its all right there. He’s not a “reddit guy” he’s a 4Chan guy. And there’s a fucking difference hahaha. Add an obsession with guns and a desire to kill (the common denominator) and boom. The right is so obsessed with hating the left, they don’t even realize the alt-right implosion that’s happening within their own people.</div>

My car literally had a part fail that was covered under warranty but the first dealer I took it to insisted it wasn’t and wanted $7000 for the repair. Fought back and forth with Chevy customer service and the dealer and told 50 different things.

Call a dealer 1hr and a half away describe the issue he tells me oh yeah it’s covered and explains how it’s covered and how the warranty works because it’s an EV and I took it to him and yup, paid $0 other than diagnostic fee from first dealer which I tried to get waived since they lied to me but they settled for half of the diagnostic fee.</div>

Would anyone be so kind and recommend a way to have the web app Pro model to review the code written by Codex CLI (other than copy/paste)? This would be such a strong combination.

Tariffs leading to economic decline/uncertainty and more expensive data centers, deporting and limiting visas for researchers, and cutting funding for research might delay agi until investors get fed up and stop providing funding. Then the entire industry stagnates for decades. By the time it gets back on its feet, well all be old or dead by then and wont make it far enough to see agi actually happen, never mind benefit from it. Assuming climate change doesnt make large scale organized research impossible by then. But hey, at least we owned the libs! </div>
