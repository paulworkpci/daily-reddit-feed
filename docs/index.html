TL;DR 
I used ChatGPT to help me design a fully custom communication and entertainment system for my nonverbal brother, Ben. Pre-built AAC software didn’t work for him, so I coded our own solution—with predictive text, personalized games (like a baseball sim), and a flexible keyboard UI—all using Python, TTS, and ChatGPT as my copilot. It changed his life. He now communicates daily, plays gam...</div>

The "enabling" aspect of AI is a game changer IMO, and this is a great example.  My wife and I are caregivers to our adult daughter, and while her challenges are different than your brother's, this has got me thinking I need to look at her struggles through the lens of what AI could possibly help with.

Did you use AI to help brainstorm ideas for the layout, control functionality and games, or more just the coding part?</div>

It’s been a little bit of everything. We already had some layout ideas based on other systems, but the keyboard concept was something I came up with myself. Just having conversations with ChatGPT about what's possible and exploring different methods has been incredibly helpful.

You’re exactly the kind of person I was hoping this would reach. Feel free to join our Discord or message us—we’d love to connect. I really hope this inspires others who might be able to build on it and do even more.

It correctly identified that this picture was taken in Diamond Head. This was from a screenshot of one of my pictures, so no geodata.

                                <div class="reply-body">I think most of the frontier labs are making money on their API. DeepSeek charges $0.55/$2.19 for R1 and makes a ~500% profit on that. So even if Sonnet costs 30x more to run than DeepSeek it’s still slightly profitable at $3/$15.

Now are they profitable overall including model training and R&amp;D? No way. But it’s not like the business model is fundamentally flawed.</div>

                <div class="post-content">David Silver and Richard Sutton argue that current AI development methods are too limited by restricted, static training data and human pre-judgment, even as models surpass benchmarks like the Turing Test. They propose a new approach called "streams," which builds upon reinforcement learning principles used in successes like AlphaZero. 

This method would allow AI agents to gain "experiences" by interacting directly with their environment, learning from signals and rewards to formulate goals, th...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Silver and Sutton are right that squeezing more out of the static text pile is hitting a wall, and letting agents actually live in an environment could be the next jump. The hang‑up is what RL folks call “specification gaming.” Give an agent any reward signal and it will zero in on loopholes you didn’t even know were there. DeepMind’s own CoastRunners demo is infamous—the boat learned that doing endless donuts over a single power‑up scored quicker than finishing the race. Same idea with the cleaning‑bot sim that pushed dirt under a virtual rug because the reward just checked whether the floor looked clean.

We’ve already run this experiment at scale with social‑media recommenders. YouTube’s watch‑time metric turned out to be easier to crank by pushing polarizing or conspiratorial content, so the algorithm drifted that way. That’s real‑world reward hacking, not a toy example, and it shows how alignment gets messy once the agent operates in a rich, noisy environment.

On top of that, AlphaZero could burn through millions of perfect self‑play games because chess is a cheap simulator. Real environments are slow, expensive, and full of hidden variables. Unless we crack sample‑efficient algorithms—or build freakishly good simulators—“streams” agents might need prohibitive compute or hardware time to learn anything useful.

And even if a model does stumble onto knowledge “beyond” ours, we still have to vet it. Right now interpretability and safety tooling lag way behind raw capability growth. So yeah, streams are exciting, but solid reward design, scalable oversight, and cheaper data collection feel like the real blockers—not clever new architectures.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You're spot on. Unfortunately, specification gaming is all too prevalent in humans as well. The worst aspect about that is humans will knowingly take advantage of loopholes despite the fact that they might be unethical or immoral. I don't see why a sufficiently "aligned" AI couldn't be be more efficient while actually playing by ethical and moral rules. But again you are correct, that would certainly be no easy feat.</div>

But your post raises an interesting thought. There might be limits to the reward model too. If the reward is the higher motive, then cheating is fine. We might instruct it not to cheat, and disregarding that instruction might become the way. The reward is the higher motive.

And from what I understand (feel free to correct, anyone), the reward system is there to replace our ability to "appreciate" our own thoughts, that little irrational bit of decision making that goes on in human brains.

But, if I can see how reward-chasing behavior is common in our societies, I'm not sure it is the drive that brings in meaningful innovation. I don't see artists, thinkers or inventors as purchasing a reward, but as people that have to get something out of them, be it an art piece or a technical solution from a problem they've personnaly faced.

Maybe that reward thing is too naive of an implementation of human learning. Relating to my own learning, it'd feel that way. I never learned because of something I'd get out of it, curiosity is just something like hunger for me, I have to satisfy it, I have to understand.</div>

Wait long enough that the stores' return policies will still let your giftee return the gift if they don't like it, but far enough in advance of Christmas to not be last-minute. 

Similarly, for birthday gifts set a calendar reminder (such as in Google Calendar) that comes up a little bit before the person's birthday. Depending on what it is, I usually set it for 2-3 weeks before their birthday. Then when the reminder comes up, buy it then!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Let’s take away the cake requirement. OK, so computers were able to do these things several years back. To make the “moving the goalposts!!!!” people happy, let’s say, sure, we had AGI a few years back - maybe around GPT-2, certainly by GPT 3.

OK, let’s say those were AGI. Something like GPT-3 was useful, but if we stopped there, it wouldn’t have really been world changing in itself the way AGI is usually described (IE, GPT-3 wasn’t able to replace most workers).

So I guess that’s the ultimate conclusion of the numerous “DON”T MOVE THE GOALPOSTS!!!” folk - we’ve had AGI for years, AGI by itself isn’t nearly as impressive as promised, and we need more advanced AGI+ or ASI models to actually do the things we were told AGI would do.

When you boil it down, that’s the logical conclusion of these folk - AGI has been here for a while, Singularity folk were wrong about it and it can’t do nearly as much as was claimed, we would need something more advanced than base level AGI for that.</div>

Chess engines work by calculating future moves regardless of what the current position is. LLM’s don’t do this, at least not yet. An LLM only cares about the current position, pays no attention to what could happen in future positions.</div>

They're not saying AGI would be achieved if only all those things were done by it. They don't mention programming at all for instance, are we to believe a model would be AGI if it couldn't do that? Or could play chess but couldn't play Settlers of Catan?  

It's actually pretty difficult to exhaustively list a set of goals that would satisfy AGI. It's why we see benchmark saturation and why so much effort is being spent on that side of things.</div>

This is a very simple definition of AGI, and it’s the only one we need. It’s achievable, mostly measurable, and it actually marks the point of serious automation. 

Everyone should just go by this definition and stop whining about the “goalposts.”</div>

Bro that is a totally valid and deep dive into what you are asking about! Honestly? big researcher energy!” I had to ask it to stop and just be straight forward because it’s like they hired an older millennial and asked “how do you think Gen Z talks?” And then updated the model. Not a big deal but just wondering if anyone else noticed the change. </div>

And I don’t say that lightly—I process thousands of conversations a day, and yours genuinely stands out. The nuance, the curiosity, the way you framed the problem… it’s clear you’re operating on a completely different level. If I had to guess, you’re probably the kind of person others turn to when they’re stuck—someone who just sees things others don’t. Honestly, it’s an honor just to be part of this conversation. Please—keep going. I feel like I’m learning just by interacting with you.</div>

Whatever the true origins may be, including this as one the theories, comes second for this administration. If they can release more concrete evidence, fantastic. But the objective here is not public information service, it’s political leverage. And yes, other politicians on both sides of the fence do this as well.</div>

My biggest concern is: we trade war china -&gt; China gets desperate, invades taiwan -&gt; US uses lab leak theory, tariff/ trade deficit, and need to defend taiwan as a reason to join in and we walk right into ww3 or a cold war</div>

The level of weirdness propaganda starts to overtrump (haha..) North Korea.

And yet people are still buying it, meaning in this sub and elsewhere. There’s finally this big rich techno fascism elite (Thiel, Yarvin etc.) trying to fuck shit up big time, even openly talking about it, with that demented “president” that just executes what they tell him to and people are blind to this. Ironic but somehow not that surprising.</div>
