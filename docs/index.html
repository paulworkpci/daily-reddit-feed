                                <div class="reply-body">It doesn't need to be a cold pan. You just need to cover the bacon with water when you put it in the pan. As the water boils away, it will help render the fat without burning the flesh, with the bacon being subjected to a longer simmering cook than frying alone. Once the water has boiled off (only takes a couple of minutes), the fat should have rendered to the point that it will crisp at the same rate as the rest of the bacon. It basically gives the fat a bit of extra cooking time, so you can proper crispy bacon, rather than burnt/chewy.</div>

With Claude Code typically time to understand the monorepo and context I’m around 30 to 20% context left. Barely any work can be done.

With codex cli same I typically have about 80% left. Game changer.</div>

Concerning GPT-4.5, that model was interesting. Intuitively it feels like it has a lot more nuance and knowledge. Like, maximum breadth. This appears to be an effect of scaling up pretraining. 

Gpt-5 really feels like 4.5 with o3 level intelligence and what you would have expected from o4 at mathe and coding.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Here's what i think.

Seedream is a really good IMAGE model. The best one imo. But it's not multi-modal. For complex instructions that requires intelligence... it's outclassed by Nano Banana by a lot. It's not intelligent at all.

Nano Banana is MULTI-MODAL. It's really good at following complex instructions and editing. But in terms of image quality, it's not as good as Seedream.

So if your prompt is something complicated, go Nano-Banana. If your prompt is something basic like "cute group of women on a cruise ship on a sunny day", go seedream 4.</div>

On the drawing it shows that the hypotenuse is 12 and one leg is 12. This in itself is not possible. With the equation it looks like the legs are \`a=5\` and \`b=12\` and the hypotenuse is unknown. This makes more sense but does not match the image. Lastly, 169 does NOT equal sqroot(169)

Other observations:

\- Two angles are labelled \`C\`  
\- hypotenuse is normally labelled \`c\` and the legs are labelled \`a\` and \`b\`.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hey everyone, I hope you’re doing well.
Lately, I’ve been struggling a lot because I can’t stop having conversations in my head. It’s like I’m constantly daydreaming or imagining these weird, unrealistic situations and it’s making me super anxious.
I can barely sleep sometimes I’m awake for over an hour or I keep waking up multiple times at night.
I thought meditation would help but I’m still stuck in this cycle.
I’m reaching out to see if anyone has tips to deal with it.
Any help or suggestions...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey friend. 

Try this: 

Peripheral Focus Technique (or similar terms like peripheral vision meditation, soft gaze, or panoramic vision) involves staring at a fixed point and then expanding your awareness to include the edges of your visual field, without moving your eyes.

As your attention shifts away from the focal point and encompasses the periphery, the internal monologue or "voice in your head" should go silent, leading to a sense of calm and presence

It works immediately for me, but it requires some concentration. You can even do it with your eyes closed, although you have to then imagine a point to focus on. 

Give it a try. 

Peace</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hi OP, Are you talking about these conversations going on in your head especially during meditation? Or everyday generally speaking? I'll just say something in terms of meditation. Don't give up on meditation yet. Sometimes the helpful effects of meditation happen over time. If you are having conversations in your head during meditation - and I do too sometimes- just bring your attention back to whatever it is you are using, your breath or a mantra or whatever it is. You may do that 50 times in a meditation, if you think of it 50 times. But that's okay that's "building a muscle" that will serve you well. I hope I've been responsive to your question. In any event, I wish you well.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thanks for your response. So basically, what’s happening is I have thousands of conversations running in my head, not just during meditation, but even when I’m not meditating. I feel like I’m completely lacking stillness. Overthinking has always been an issue for me, and meditation used to help I used to actually feel still while meditating. But lately, it’s been feeling impossible. Another comment mentioned that maybe I’m not in touch with my emotions which actually makes sense and got me thinking. Do you think guided meditation for couple of days will help?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That sounds really helpful, thank you for sharing. I relate to that so much sometimes I find myself stuck in pointless arguments in my head too, and it gets exhausting. I like the idea of using stories or imagining a different universe to distract myself, I’ll definitely try that. Focusing on my breath has been my go-to, but adding a creative element like you mentioned sounds fun and useful. Appreciate the suggestion! Have a great day ❤️</div>

He's playing a stupid game of semantics because he's not very intelligent. He said that due to the Democrats (or whatever the villain of the day is) blocking evidence, the only information that they have is that he trafficked girls to himself. 


He's a patsy and he's going down. He's not a serious person and clearly not qualified for such a job. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Diesel has been on its death bed for well over a decade now, thats not surprising with modern emissions regulations, what I don't understand is his insistence that hydrogen will be what replaces it long-term

&gt; “But in the 2030s, particularly that 2035 horizon, I truly believe hydrogen will be our future

&gt; “Why? Hydrogen’s clean, hydrogen has range, hydrogen infrastructure will be significantly better than what you have today, obviously. It’ll be more convenient, and it’ll be affordable.”

There is absolutely nothing obvious about this, especially in comparison to progress w/ EV range, charge rates, technology, etc. 

&gt; We have an abundance of hydrogen in this country

We have an abundance of hydrogen in any country, thats not the issue, difficult to transport, difficult to store, difficult to dispense, the physics of that have not changed

Hydrogen stores the same power as it did today, as it did yesterday, as it did millennia ago, fantastic energy to weight, abhorrent energy to volume. Japan can't do renewables quite as well, nuclear is unpopular, if they try to import renewable electricity its from their opps, maybe slightly you could justify sinking money (really just do nuclear)

But Australia? Their green hydrogen plans have not gone well thus far</div>

It's the Toyota corporate line.

Toyota Japan has sunk SO much money into hydrogen, as it's the Japanese Gov's preferred strategy to guide the automotive industry, given Japans electrical grid insecurity (it's kinda wild, but basically there's 2 completely incompatible power grids on the island. This isn't like Texas during the winter storms, it's even worse). It's part of the reason Toyota and Honda are so far behind with their own platforms of EVs, they sunk so much into Hydrogen due to their choice to focus on local thinking vs worldwide. They bet the farm hoping they could force Hydrogen and keep Japan's powertrain advantage like they had with Hybrids for so long.

/r/cars tends to like it too because "stupid teslas can't win"</div>

Realistically, if I’m doing a job and someone ask this, I’m very upfront and tell them “I can do a lower price but I will also use lower quality materials, the lower quality could be just fine or it could need redone sooner than the better quality materials. The price I quoted is with the materials I recommend based on my experience”</div>

                <div class="post-content">No uncanny valley,just ultra-humanlike robots that feel natural.

Hangzhou-based AheafFrom isn’t just building emotional humanoid robots, but replicas of future humans.

They collaborate with artists to craft beautiful appearances, powered by CharacterMind, a system that gives robots “emotions.”

It understands tone, expressions, and gestures, then responds with voice, facial expressions, eye contact, and body language,making interactions feel like talking to a real person.
