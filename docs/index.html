So, when the common meme went around about scrambled text, he though the entire office was pulling a prank. He got really upset, as if we were all trying to make him look dumb. It was really awkward. Boss got involved, his good friend.

Guy just could not process the scrambled letters. He worked QC, and could absolutely proofread text accurately.</div>

From what I've read, they invite a TON of girls. They'll invite one and tell them to invite ALL their girlfriends and tell them to bring their friends. Girls with no social media presence, doesn't matter, Drakes crew brings them over to try to get with them. The more there are the better the odds.</div>

Reminds me of the old days where any serious programming had to be done in Assembly to ensure maximum performance on the very limited HW we had.

                                <div class="reply-body">Both Altman and Amodei are full of shit, even by CEO standards full of shit. Altman specially. He's accusing DeepSeek of "IP theft" because of the distillation and I wonder, whose IP? Because 99.9% of the IP content OpenAI parsed is stolen. Also a few weeks before the DeepSeek earthquake Altman was accusing smaller companies of "copying OpenAI's approaches" when OpenAI solely exists thanks to copying Google's groundbreaking *Attention is All You Need* paper.

It's infuriating how "Open"AI is constantly taking from the open source community and publicly available research and they never contribute anything to it.</div>

I write a lot of optimized GPU shader code for games that run on platforms with limited performance.

It's more surprising to me than anything these AI companies weren't already doing this. It seems like it's the most obvious thing to optimize in the first place because doing something like this is so common in 3D graphics already.</div>

Not to sound like a smart ass, but and? So what if its weird, just attach a little message with some context if needed. Nosurf IS an idea against a major part of the current culture.

How much is social media interfering with life? You seem to genuinely enjoy reels, no problem with that, but I'm guessing you use them longer than wanted? If so, let's say an order was passed tomorrow that u/AprehensivePotato was banned from their phone for a month. What do you plan on doing with that free time? A lot of people try nosurf without truly being able to answer that question and fall flat on their face. Alternatively they try to follow someone elses "plan" with it doesn't fit for them (for example, quitting apps that are more useful than harmful to them personally because someone else finds it harmful.)</div>

Hobbies feel like work now. I get FOMO and my brain wants the slot machine of what interesting science, art, or families are going to show up on my feed. 

I started sending people fun pics over text and trying out texting conversations. It’s not the same anymore. I’m an adult, my friends are adults. It’s a little exhausting to keep a conversation going back and forth. 

Facebook or Instagram comments? 

no resistance or anxiety. 

Post it, and someone will come and talk to you. Fully their choice. No pressure. 

I miss the entire cultural dynamic of 2008 and prior. I’m learning that’s never coming back. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes, exactly. However, working in marketing, I’m part of the crew of engineers working to make social media more addicting. 

Just as there is the perfect mix of sugar, carbs, and chemicals in Cheeto dust to raise your insulin and mess with your hormones to make it almost as addicting as cocain—-

Same for social media. The red bells, the slot-machine of random content, curated by an algorithm just enough that it’s exactly the topics you want to see. 

Social media is engineered to be addicting. Some people are more immune to it. Many people hormonally and psychologically, will have a hard time putting it down. 

I miss 2008 and before. The internet was way more fun then. We created more stuff. We had legitimate community in niche forums. We could also go meet at a Taco Casa and hang out, and we couldn’t bring our big computers with us. </div>

Edit : for the morons claiming he hasn’t done anything with Rogan in 4 years. He was literally performing at rogans club around a year ago.

But Bills most famous JRE clip is him arguing with Joe, and Bill hates when people idolize him for 'attacking someone' , especially his friends. And Joe spends 80% of his time bringing up politics. So I could see Burr saying that he just doesn't want it to turn into a mini-controversy, yet still remain friends with Rogan.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">From James Lacatski, founder of AAWSAP, his book Inside the US Government Covert UFO Program: Initial Revelations

*Possible Nature of UAP Technology*

A framework for scientific hypothesis on the UAP observations can be built on the identification (admittedly very coarse) of the six major layers of UAP effects. If we must formulate a view of the problem in a single statement at this point, that statement will be: 

*Everything works as if UAP were the product of a technology that integrates physical and psychic phenomena and primarily affects cultural variables in our society through the manipulation of physio- logical and psychological parameters in the witnesses.*

This single statement can be examined as follows:

a) The phenomenon is the product of technology. During the observation, the UAP is a real, physical, material object. However, it appears to use either very clever deception or very advanced physical principles, resulting in the effects we have called “anti-physical," which must eventually be reconciled with the laws of physics. 

b) The technology triggers psychic effects either purposely or as a side effect of its manifestations. 

*These consciousness phenomena are now too common to be ignored or relegated to the category of exaggerated or ill-observed facts. All of us who have investigated close-range sightings have become familiar with these effects.*

c) The purpose of the technology may be cultural manipulation—possibly but not necessarily under the control of a form of non-human intelligence—in which case the physiological and psy- chological effects are a means to that end. But the parapsychologist with a Jungian framework may argue that the human collective unconscious is also a potential source of such effects without the need to invoke alien intervention. 

The AAWSAP BAASS data warehouse (named CAPELLA by its designer, Dr. J. Vallee) currently includes 248,141 unusual aerial phenomena reports of sightings occurring from 593 B.C. to the present time. Some of the sightings in the data warehouse are duplicated reports and some have received classical explanations as natural phenomena. Sighting reports of sufficient intent for fur- ther analysis within the warehouse are divided into one of four classifications: 

» 48% of reports are considered "flyby" (FB) events where the observed object(s) travel with- out discontinuity 

» 31% of reports are considered "close encounters” (CE) where an object(s) is observed on or near the ground

 » 15% of reports are considered “maneuver" (MA) events where an observed object(s) dis- plays a discontinuous trajectory

 » 6% of reports are considered “anomalies” (AN) events which include sightings such as amorphous lights, and other unexplained anomalous activity

And from Skinwalkers at the Pentagon:

Phase 6: After 2010, the frequency of black triangle sightings began to diminish. But the world now knows that since 2004, then escalating during 2014–2015 and continuing through 2021, UFOs, which were now being called UAPs, were routinely interacting with high performance combat aircraft from the United States Navy and with multiple United States military ships and aircraft carriers on both the East and West coasts.

Whether or not these six roughly chronological phases collectively constitute an obscure agenda by a single phenomenon, their cumulative unfolding has had profound effects on western human society since 1947.

One question that arises from these six phases: Is someone trying to tell us something? Does consciousness have something to do with it?

In the last ten years a growing number of highly respected scientists from multiple disciplines have begun to question the nature of human consciousness. This small, but very influential group has aggressively pushed back against the hundred-year dogma in biology and in neuroscience that consciousness is a consequence of, and emerges from, neurochemical trafficking in the brain.

Bernardo Kastrup, a scientist from the Netherlands with a PhD in computer science and a second PhD in philosophy, has been one of the more outspoken members of this group. In several books and articles,37,38 Kastrup powerfully argues that consciousness is primary and gives rise to physical reality, not the other way around. These arguments essentially turn a century of dogma that has pervaded every level of science and of policy making on its head.

Other eminent scientists, such as Edward Kelly at University of Virginia,39 renowned microprocessor inventor Federico Faggin,11 Rice University’s Jeffrey Kripal,40 and stem cell biologist Robert Lanza41,42 are pioneering a revolutionary new way of looking at human consciousness.

This multi-disciplinary assault on the old materialistic views of science will have long lasting effects on the science of consciousness going forward.

This intellectual insurgency may even extend into how we view UAPs.
Each of the six phases of the phenomenon, as they slowly unfolded globally from 1947 to 2021, may have had separate and distinct impacts on human society.

Firstly, the continuous waves of UFO sightings have impacted literally millions of individual eyewitnesses who have had their worldview turned upside down. Secondly, consider the profound cultural consequences of the ripple effects from claims of encounters with “extraterrestrials” named Orthon, Aura Rhanes, or Diana by the contactees.

We may never know how the UAP became the worst nightmare of the military-industrial complex as they secretly grappled with the enormous calamity of hundreds of blatant UAP intrusions into the airspace over their Air Force bases and Navy ships, and with the sabotaging of some ICBMs during 1960s-1980s. To what extent did these intrusions engender a feeling of helplessness at multiple levels of the chains of military command?
And finally, what about the impact of the more than two-decade-long assault on an estimated hundreds of thousands of abductees and on their families through multiple generations?

In 2021 it is difficult to evaluate the jarring ontological shock that has been visited upon a mainly materialist, physicalist human society by the UAP over the past 75 years.

Without having some consensus understanding on what constitutes human consciousness, collectively we have no idea about just how profound the shakeup caused by these mysterious phenomena has been on human consciousness, or ultimately what their future impact on humans will be.</div>

A very candid admission from a retired USAF Brigadier General Blaine Holt: "I absolutely do not refute that there are extra-terrestrials and that more will be coming out". On the White House drone announcement he said "We need to dive into who's MISINFORMING the President this early in his administration, need to root that out, we need to find out what's going on across this nation....because it's the tip of the iceberg and it's part of something much bigger."

To think they are all lying is just not even plausible imo. This is what tells me there is clearly something to it all.

Edit: I’m done replying to the comments that say “but where is the evidence?”. Yes, of course we need evidence. Hopefully with time we will get it.  You don’t have to believe anything, just consider the possibility at the least.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is one of the facts that surprises me the most. The *caliber* of people coming forward is important in itself. If this was ANY other topic, people would be listening intently to what these people say. Some would straight up take it as matter of fact. 

When it relates to the phenomenon, however, what happens often in this and the other subs is that "this must be a psyop" arguments. Which makes no sense in all honesty. 

If it's a psyop on us, then what's the end goal here? They are just getting people who are already in the topic more invested. Worst case scenario, and it all turns out to be somehow false, we all just go back to our lives, and nothing happened. So what's the point? To make us look "crazy" for a bit? So that John in Accounting laughs a bit at us and then forgets about it all by the end of the week?

And if it's a psyop amongst themselves, they are hitting their own highly decorated, experienced personel just to make them look... crazy? What for? People already distrust the government (mostly), this just make things worse for them cause the argument would be "why keep so many 'crazy' people in important positions." 

We should listen carefully to what these folks are saying, whether you believe it or not, there *is* something going on, and it's fascinating to see ir unfold live. Reality will be weirder than fiction, and I'm all in for it!</div>

You probably have tons of NHI species, you have the gatekeepers, private contractors, billionaires, tons of random low level politicians etc who all want to be gatekeepers

Too many people want a slice once you build a system that encourages an endless conveyor belt of greedy bastards 

They behave like people at the reduced section over money &amp; human power let alone NHI power

Even the good guys, even us

Sure we would disclose, but let’s be honest we would feel like UFO Jesus if we had any clout towards disclosure credit 

It’s just who we are as people good &amp; bad, we want something &amp; all the credit</div>

Bills fame was in no way started by or dependent on rogans platform like some others. 

Bill says it how it is and has always pushed back hard on Joe in conversations when he doesn’t agree so idk why you think he was in the rogansphere to begin with</div>

Are they stupid or are they dishonest?

I can't tell most of the time but I assume for the higher ups it's dishonesty because they have enough credentials to not be stupid.

                                <div class="reply-body">The transcript for that question:

**Senator Warren:** Let’s keep going. You are right to say yes because every American has the right to know that every decision you make as our number one health officer is to help them—not to make money for yourself in the future.

So, I want to talk more about money. I’m looking at your paperwork right now. In the past two years, you’ve raked in $2.5 million from a law firm called Wisner Baum. You go online, you do commercials to encourage people to sign up with Wisner Baum to join lawsuits against vaccine makers. And for everyone who signs up, you personally get paid, and if they win their case, you get 10% of what they win. So, if you bring in someone who gets $10 million, you walk away with a million dollars. 

Now, you just said that you want the American people to know that you cannot be bought, your decisions won’t depend on how much money you could make in the future, you won’t go work for a drug company after you leave HHS. But you and I both know there’s another way to make money. 

So, Mr. Kennedy, will you also agree that you also won’t take any compensation from any lawsuits against drug companies while you are Secretary and for four years afterwards?

**Mr. Kennedy**: Well, I will certainly commit to that while I'm Secretary. But I do want to clarify something because you make me sound like a shill. I put together that case. I did the science day presentation to the judge on that case to get it into court, the docket hearing – 

**Senator Warren**: Mr. Kennedy, it’s just a really simple question. You’ve taken in $2.5 million, I want to know if you will commit right now that not only will you not go to work for drug companies, you won’t go to work suing the drug companies and taking your rake out of that while you are Secretary and for four years after.

Cut to a few years later and they're like, here, everyone can use it if they want to  generate all the fake news they want, we are embracing this post-truth world we live in.</div>
