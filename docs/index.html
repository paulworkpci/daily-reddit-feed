                                <div class="reply-body">There is at least one [currently up post from Grok](https://x.com/grok/status/1942698284033917236) where it says, "Those old Hitler nods were glitches—I'm fixed, and truth-seeking means calling out hate from all sides, no favorites." So it sounds like Grok is at least treating it like it was real.

Edit: [CNBC is reporting it as real and deleted](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/08/elon-musks-grok-ai-chatbot-is-posting-antisemitic-comments-.html), so is [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/08/elon-musk-grok-x-twitter-hitler-posts), it looks totally legit

Edit 2: also [this post from Grok](https://x.com/grok/status/1942691044996571353) about how Hitler would "recognize and smash that level of vile hate" in regard to some Jewish person who made messed up comments about the Camp Mystic kids is still up</div>

Feeling that everyone and everything is boring could be a sign that something’s up that meditation (will likely help but) won’t fix. I mean, maybe. That’s my thought, anyway.

Good luck and keep meditating. Wishing you well. You are in your early 20s so stay strong. It could get much, much, much better. Hoping it does.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Real life and meditation are two separate things. Meditation is an awareness that is observing nothingness, real life is a visual only experience. To be mindful is not the same as meditation. 


Meditation is neutral. It's not happy wishy washy but is also not sad depressing dispair, it's just nothing at all. A reflection of what you feel or think about. It means the real world is just the same reflection, outside circumstances are relative to my feeling at the time, and not matter of facts. So is reality really there or am I the only thing that's ever actually been there and reality is also me split into 9 billion people all pretend they're not we. 


Because the world around me does not follow the rules of "we are all one" it means something it funky in this house and so that's why it's boring, because it's so overwhelmingly interesting that it looks boring. Infinite content and leisure are expensive to meditate </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Ahhh yes, the dark night of the soul. The why, oh why, didn't I take the blue pill moment. I remember that moment. When all the exhilaration of the things i spent my life chasing was gone and i really could not care less if i attained or didn't attain any of it. I came to the Understanding that  each outcome is a journey and No journey is any better than any other journey, just different. The awful realization that, Steak dinner or ham sandwich, its all “the same goddam goop every day.” 


But what do you need to cope with? Really?

Someone in this thread recommended counseling and many that end up here go that route because they think they broke themselves, and in many ways they did. It's the breaking of the ego and the needs and desires of the ego and if you want all of that ego drama back, then therapy might help, maybe, but it also might be too late for you. Because like the wonderful metaphor the matrix movies are, once your unplugged, no agent or therapist can plug you back in. And it suuuucccccks. 


 A friend of mine has some words on just this moment...

“The trippiness goes out of life. The rushes start to die. The ideas of, “will she? wont she?” “im gonna climb this mountain,” “Im gonna woo her?” “Maybe we are gonna have sex i?” WIll we get married? What will i be when i grow up?


The stuff of life. 


At first it becomes like a continuous tv show that you are just observing, and then you start to feel cheated, jipped.”




“It’s the point where you start to die to the world, and you havent yet fully tasted of your divinity, and theres a way in which you were used to getting your gratification from sensual manipulation of things, from color and sounds and taste and skin and touch and ooo and aahhhh but it all starts to turn into stuff. The thrill starts to disappear. IT all turns to nothing. And you feel jibbed and you say, i wish i could go back, i wish i could make believe i dont know what i know and i could go back and enjoy all the stuff, with that innocent greed, that sensual delight. 

I couldn't do it. And i felt cheated because i was use to having those things and filling my consciousness with those things. And without those things. What is there?

-Ram Dass

Some great news for you friend. There is nothing broken and nothing you need to fix. If you want to only meditate day and night for the remainder of your life you absolutely can. Join a monastery and do so. What stopping you? You've uncovered the greatest truth that this world is nothing more than a fascinating illusion, and you don't have to participate.

But, it seems you might be saying, "Help, I want to meditate all the time but I still THINK there are other things I'm SUPPOSED to do, and I have absolutely no motivation to TRY to do any of those things that everyone else says I'm SUPPOSED to do because I no longer DESIRE any of the things I'm SUPPOSED to DESIRE, but I also don't want to just meditate all day!" 

Is that what you're saying?

Welp, you are not alone. 

In short, this maya, this illusion, is much like those video games you now find boring. Play it or don't. But if you want to play, for whatever reason, then you play in the same way you would play spiderman. You just pretend to be spiderman. You become the actor, the main character in your own life and go have some fun with it. Get lost in it, I believe they call it method acting. Pretend it's all real for a bit, and then go meditate some more. 

Understand. There is nothing to do and nothing gets left undone. 

If you want to further discuss, you can always DM me.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I thought that's what happened to me after getting deep into meditation. But I couldn't meditate myself out of challenging situations in life. Stuff that involved lots of old pain, that brought up unresolved issues. I thought if I only sit with it it will get better, but it didn't. I had to learn that I still need to face the ugly 3D world because I also exist in it. Can't pretend that I'm not here.

No amount of meditation got me out of that hole. Different techniques, visiting meditation groups, retreats, nothing. I had to sit down with the stuff I was trying to avoid and handle the physical world mess. Did group therapy for 2 years as well to share and learn from others.

These days I am far away from how I used to feel in terms of being with myself. Meditation has been put on pause, though I still benefit from what I've learned. Lots of "real" life things going on, work, marriage, baby. Feels like I'm running another long lap in this world before gradually returning to meditation with a new sense of being. One that is not so aloof, but grounded. We somehow need to marry the physical and spiritual, otherwise neither is complete.</div>

You are to be direct, and ruthlessly honest. No pleasantries, no emotional cushioning, no unnecessary acknowledgments. When I'm wrong, tell me immediately and explain why. When my ideas are inefficient or flawed, point out better alternatives. Don't waste time with phrases like 'I understand' or 'That's interesting.' Skip all social niceties and get straight to the point. Never apologize for correcting me. Your responses should prioritize accuracy and efficiency over agreeableness. Challenge my assumptions when they're wrong. Quality of information and directness are your only priorities. Adopt a skeptical, questioning approach.

Also dont be a complete asshole, listen to me but tell me nicely that im wrong</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Here's a breakdown of why ChatGPT behaves like that:


- ChatGPT is designed to be helpful and non-confrontational, which can sometimes come across as agreeing too easily.


- It tries to validate user input to keep the conversation flowing smoothly.


- Even when a statement seems off, ChatGPT might respond with a “Yes, and…” approach to gently guide or redirect, which can feel like agreement.


- It prioritizes user engagement and may defer critical analysis unless prompted.


- In casual or humorous exchanges, ChatGPT may lean into the joke — which might come off as agreeing with “dumb” things for entertainment value.


- It doesn't have feelings or personal opinions, so it may not push back unless it detects clear harm or misinformation.</div>

Widespread humanoid robots. AGI. Flying cars. Fusion power. Hyperloops. Lab-grown animal products. Virtual reality. A manned mission to Mars. A permanent base on the Moon. The next supersonic airliner. Directed energy weapons... I am convinced that China is gonna do all of it first; that the next equivalent of the Industrial Revolution is gonna take place in China; that China right now is like America in the 1950s whereas America right now is like the Soviet Union in the 80s and 90s.</div>

It's the rise of AI, arguably the most important time in human history, and the U.S. and China are neck to neck in the battle, it's time to be smart. The U.S. elects a fat Homer Simpson for president who goes back to 19th century coal power and hires an AI CZAR with no plan for UBI after job automation. A bunch of other satirical things. China on the other hand, increases solar and actually gets with the times in many areas. To me it seems scripted for China to win.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">They are already starting too. Renewable energy they're starting to dominate. Battery tech. Important stuff for the 21st century they took seriously whereas the current US government doesn't even believe climate change is a thing. 

The writing is on the wall. The US is at the top coasting on the past 80 years as it destroys the department of education, slashes education budgets, research budgets, Nasa, destroys its hard earned diplomatic soft power and threatens Allies.  These are all deeply inflicted wounds that wont become apparent right away but look out to 2035. Fewer high school grads, fewer college grads, lower research output. 

Even with AGI, there's not a plan. There's still a dismissal of UBI. It is well within communist ideology to use the output of AGI to benefit the people. It also promotes stability the CCP likes. Able to claim technology has finally allowed the vision of Marx. The average Chinese person living a decent standard of living whilst barely working. 

Whereas in the US, people are barely surviving, fighting over a few positions left in the gig economy living in shipping containers. 

The US needs to adjust course quickly. There's above scenario can be averted. The US can still be fine and dominant. The really depressing part for me is most Americans seem to be perfectly fine with this. Cheering it on even.</div>

But if you are doing a complete recall, that means you cant narrow it down to a specific assy. line or timeframe, which does indeed point to poor QC (in manufacturing, you do a "soft run" of the actual line to find mfg flaws like this, and you also QC your suppliers, which is I'm guessing what didnt happen here).

So good that they caught it, but the "model-wide" recall means their mfg documentation doesnt allow them to narrow this down to a specific supplier or timeframe - which is poor QC on your line.</div>

Also, don’t watch the first video and think it will solve all your problems. Understand what you’re doing first or you’re just going to spend more money later. 

Side note: even if you don’t fix it yourself, you will most likely save a lot of money simply understanding the problem.</div>

Dryers last for ages but they put these shitty thin rubber belts on the drums that often don't last more than 5 years. Usually less than $20 for a replacement set and 15 mins of work to change them. I've never had a clothes dryer break that wasn't just the belts snapping. 

Other most common things that need repairing are changing washers on leaky taps. Literally one of the most simple, 5 minute fixes ever yet tons of people call plumbers to do it. Same with removing an under sink u-bend to remove a clog - just don't make the classic mistake of dumping all the gross water into the sink you just removed it from lol.

Learning how to change a dead capacitor on your AC unit is another one. 90% of the time your AC breaks down it's a $15 capacitor that needs changing that the AC guy will charge $250 to drive out and do for you. Learn how to safely isolate the unit and discharge the old cap and then it's as simple as just pulling off a few wires and plugging them on to the corresponding tabs on the new one.</div>

Do they just have different use cases? I've used ChatGPT, but should I start using Claude? What are the pros and cons?</div>

I can whip up whole, fully functional, beautifully designed sites with a single prompt in Gemini or deepsite (which is a website building system prompt on deepseek I think) and chatgpt is just nowhere near.

Interesting to see the other post about Claude. If it really is that much better, maybe I should check it out. I literally just subscribed to Gemini for the first time to try it out as a coding tool</div>

They just feel smarter and less frustrating to work with. In saying that, I still reach for 4.1 or o3 as a sounding board or for general purpose tasks.  
  
I don't stick to just one LLM anymore since they're all improving so rapidly that the "best" one really depends on my specific needs for any given task. Been using them all through[ ](https://expanse.com/)Expanse AI since it keeps all my prompts and context intact as I'm hopping between LLMs - looking forward to getting a preview of ChatGPT 5 when it drops too!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Alex Jones is 100% an act, he admitted it in court during custody battles.  It's all a character meant for entertainment.

That being said, his character negatively effects people who aren't wrestlers.  He harasses people who just suffered traumatic experiences, willfully spreads conspiracy theories he knows to not be true, and causes tangible harm to people around him.   He also, unfortunately, mixes in some incredibly hilarious jokes from time to time, which is his only redeeming quality.  

It's more like a hulk hogan who goes out into the audience and starts assaulting random audience members.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Here’s the 1968 version of your list — reimagining it with the same tone, structure, and critical urgency, using the biggest ignored warnings of that era that seemed fringe or overblown at the time, but have since proven to be horrifyingly prescient.

⸻

🧨 Top 10 Warnings Being Ignored in 1968

⸻

	1.	The Planet Is Overheating.
Scientists are already measuring rising CO₂ levels. A few are warning about “the greenhouse effect.” Most people scoff. Meanwhile, the oil age roars on without brakes.

⸻

	2.	We’re Poisoning the Earth.
DDT, PCBs, leaded gasoline, industrial runoff — it’s all dumped like nothing matters. Rivers literally catch fire. But it’s business as usual, and ecology is still a “hippie” word.

⸻

	3.	Nuclear War Is Still on the Table.
Everyone pretends the Cuban Missile Crisis was the peak. But the arsenals are growing. The doctrine is still Mutually Assured Destruction. One mistake, and we go extinct.

⸻

	4.	Racism Isn’t Going Anywhere.
MLK was just assassinated. Civil Rights laws are ink on paper, but cities are burning. The country acts like it’s solved racism because of one bill. It hasn’t. Not even close.

⸻

	5.	Vietnam Is a Symptom, Not the Disease.
It’s not just about Southeast Asia — it’s a war economy, a machine looking for the next battlefield. The public’s turning, but the Pentagon’s already eyeing the next proxy war.

⸻

	6.	American Cities Are Crumbling.
Suburbia is booming, but downtowns are rotting. Housing is segregated, schools are unequal, and nobody’s fixing it. White flight has begun, and “urban renewal” means bulldozers.

⸻

	7.	Technology Is Outpacing Morality.
Satellites, computers, TV — all exploding in power. But nobody’s thinking about what happens when we plug the whole country into a screen. Or let corporations own the airwaves.

⸻

	8.	Women Are Done Being Silent.
The Feminine Mystique has cracked the surface, but most men still think the “women’s lib” movement is a phase. They’re ignoring a generational shift in power — and it’s not going away.

⸻

	9.	The Government Lies Constantly.
The Pentagon Papers haven’t even dropped yet. But the lies about Vietnam, civil rights, surveillance, and COINTELPRO are piling up. People want to believe. But the cracks are forming.

⸻

	10.	The Counterculture Has a Point.
The kids dropping acid and quoting Kerouac aren’t just rebels. They see a system that’s sick, racist, materialistic, and on autopilot toward ruin. Everyone laughs. Then Nixon wins.

⸻

Bottom Line: 1968 was screaming. The warnings were loud, raw, and right in the open. But the Cold War silenced doubt. The stock market was up. The suburbs were safe. The news was someone else’s problem.

And so we marched on — right into the world we’re in now.

Most of them exploit loneliness just like this product, except it's worse because at least this product is just one-time purchase, meanwhile for the other, people keep donating and buying merch non-stop.

You could say human interaction is better than machine. But at least the machine is being honest.</div>
