                        <div class="comment-body">I'm happy that OAI allowed PLUS usage of Codex for free - this is really great.

However, am I the only one or is GPT-5-Codex absolutely dogshit compared to agents like Cline or RooCode? Perhaps I'm doing something wrong because in Roo or Cline GPT-5 is doing **amazing** things and I absolutely love it... Once I try to use it with sub on Codex CLI it absolutely fails even simpliest changes or simpliest one-shot apps. Any tips to solve skill issue on Codex CLI?</div>

Asking because something played at my gym today that was so inexplicably perfect for CrossFit (while simultaneously being totally inappropriate for a gym class and perfectly on brand for one of our beloved coaches 😂). And not one track: an entire playlist. 

I’ll reveal what it was once I get a few contenders. Wrong guesses encouraged. True...</div>

 Dev teams are expensive. It got me thinking  in a world of vibe coding,” maybe the model doesn’t have to be a full in-house team. What if the core work is done by someone like me using AI and no-code,or even base44 and then freelancers come in just to polish and finish the tricky parts?



That’s basically what happened to me with one prosuct: I needed a custom internal tool to connect our CRM to WhatsApp support. I started building it myself (thanks GPT), but hit a wall. Instead of hiring ...</div>

It also allows me to work on stuff I don't have a lot of familiarity in, but it gets very messy. Like unused files everywhere, multiple versions of the same logic in multiple places, tests that don't do anything, and on and on. Hiring some dude from Pakistan for $15 to vibe code for you is probably going to be even worse</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I would suggest going the other way. Instead of vibe coding your app from the start, regardless of those services promising “build your app with natural language” starter kit. I would suggest this flow: brainstorm your idea, workflow etc using your favourite AI. Build a project overview, requirements and results expected. Hire someone to break this into project plan, architecture, sprints goals and detailed implementation plan with your own requirements and recommendations while getting a real expert input building the foundation. Then throw that document to your favourite AI, make it break it into multiple prompts, generate guidelines and documentations and all what you need to get started. Then throw each prompt to your coding agent while ensuring that it updates its documentations and progress along the way. At any step you can restructure your prompt by telling your AI to update it or restructure it using the current documentation status. I believe having a solid plan and architecture is more cost effective. At the end if you hire someone to review your code and polish, he will have a clear structured documentation and plan potential a less messy code. Just my humble opinion.</div>

Code took much longer time to think and generate the code but the code it generated is inifinity better and it doesnt generate a buch of AI slop that you have to remove after the session no matter how detailed your prompt is.

This blows me away because chatgpt 5 thinking doesnt impress me at all. I have canceled my Claude subscription tod...</div>

Meaning I almost cancelled mine as well, but I'm on the 100 plan and was hoping the 20 chatgpt and 20 claude, and 20 or so on copilot would work, but the others have lot less limits, so I'm stuck with just the 100 claude plan and use the 20 chatgpt plan for cleanup, which works pretty well so far.</div>

Could someone recommend a book that addresses the development of the different phases of expanded states of consciousness that are achieved through repeated and long-term meditation practice, without necessarily focusing on techniques. 

For example, at first, there's difficulty concentrating, but over time, there's more control, colored spots and nternal sounds appears, a feeling of energy, the body begins to disappear, and so on. 

I know that experiences are subjective, but ...</div>

so this alteration completely fucks with the lore and makes it make less sense</div>

It's the same height as a Camry and Corolla (sorry 0.7in/17mm taller) while being longer and wider.  It has a dedicated trunk lid.  It has 4 doors, and typical ground clearance for a sedan (not an SUV).  I'd say sedan is the perfect description.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Bad analogy. This isn’t “which car uses more gas”, it’s literally about the infrastructure. Staying with your analogy it’s about who builds the highways, the power plant, the grid, the cooling and the network that let the fastest cars actually run non-stop. 

Fancy chips are worthless for next-gen training if there’s nowhere to plug them in; Musk’s point is about building infra and capability at scale, not bragging about waste.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Haha, Elon is taking a page out of Trump's 'jazz hands' playbook. NVIDEA announced yesterday that they were taking a [$100B Partnership in OpenAI](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/altman-huang-negotiations-that-sealed-100-billion-openai-nvidia-deal.html). Musk is clearly crashing out over it. yikes. I wonder if that is why he's crawling back to Daddy Trump? Perhaps an SEC play?

&gt; Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC that the 10 gigawatt project with OpenAI is equivalent to between 4 million and 5 million graphics processing units.

Or maybe Elon is hiding a fab on Mars we haven't heard about? He plans to 'beat' NVIDEA?</div>

**This is not complicated**. If Kimmel’s employer decided, without outside governmental interference, to suspend him, they’d be able to do so without issue (although I’m sure there would be contractual obligations about payment and things while suspended). 
**But because the FCC made clear and blatant references to the fact that they’d take action against the company he works for**, this is a free speech issue. It’s not about a company silencing an employee, it’s about the government threatening an employer if they didn’t punish an employee. 

It’s really not hard to get if you’re not intentionally dense.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">"Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past."  

This probably applies to other groups also.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If it sounds like it's recorded in a tin can, that's because you didn't do a simple trick.

Click "extract stems," and use version 2.  Then download all in wav form.  Go to Audacity, reduce the volume of each track by 1 or 2dB so there are fewer peaks over 0, then mix down to a single track and apply LoudMax 64bit with both sliders set to zero.

The "stems" are extracted in version 2 by running the model again on each of them - that's why it costs so much.  So, instead of having a single generation with all the instruments run through the model, you get 12 tracks that each have the same computational power applied to them.  Since there's less data input and output, it would make sense that a model of the same size could do a better job.  Adding the stems together and exporting in 24 bit audio will provide more data.

Most Suno tracks have the individual instruments overdriven in the original, leading to the tin can effect.  The model that extracts the instruments appears to be able to predict what the individual instruments would sound like if there were no information lost to the clipping.

See [https://stevesokolowski.com/songs/hold-the-ferry/definitive/](https://stevesokolowski.com/songs/hold-the-ferry/definitive/) .  This is an example of that process with the stems.  Download the lossless file; don't just listen to the compressed SoundCloud version.</div>

They obviously trained it on a lot of good music from each decade. I think they drastically reduced their training set for later models, probably due to legal fears and subsequently the latter models are not so versatile.</div>

Some of the most monumental AI infrastructure undertakings are already under construction or soon entering construction, and the proportion of GDP being spent is on the scale of the Apollo missions, and they are equivalent to the power consumption of millions of homes, and it barely makes a splash in the subreddit called singularity. 

All you guys enjoy are cool robotics demos, Gemini announcements, bashing AI, or dooming about AI's economic consequences. Most things related to the actual undertaking of the unfolding singularity get completely ignored.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This sub is not distracted, you may just overestimate the impact of more capacity coming online. 

A ton of money being spent on capacity may not be the right route to be pursued. We have clear indications that scaling laws for compute are capped - disappointing training runs earlier this year showed this. It could also be that models become more efficient (your brain runs on 10W) and all that compute isn't needed. Nobody knows. 

 I am not saying you're wrong, but I'm 100% saying that you shouldn't think so strongly that you are right because you're aligned with Altman &amp; Co - remember that these guys have a vested interest in too much compute being built, as that would drop the cost of their #1 cost item down substantially and allow them to stop losing money. This may be why you don't hear Demis talk this book as much. 

You can think that $500bn going to infra every year is the right thing, and you may be right. But if you're wrong this means that a lot of capital will be incinerated for nothing, while it could have been put to more productive use if it had been spent on other bottlenecks, or even on just implementing AI better.</div>

Really, GPT-5 is likely the perfect model for Open AI at this point in time because it allows such a great price point at the frontier while they get the rest of their infrastructure built.</div>

Btw this is different from standards: these don’t usually change much, they represent your values, while expectations are hope-based. If you have a standard of behaviour, you don’t need to expect yourself to abide by it, else it wouldn’t be your standard.</div>
