It is rarely voted out during the first or second round.  
It performs well when presenting its case to the jury of six eliminated LLMs, although o3-mini does slightly better.  
It is not often betrayed.  
Similar to o1 and o3-mini, it rarely betrays its private chat partner.

The non-reasoning model was outperformed on reasoning by the reasoning models? No way!

I doubt we see a reasoner directly based on 4.5 because of the cost and speed, but but if we do it will be a thing of beauty.</div>

                <div class="post-content">When making presentations or graphics, I keep this in mind for my audience. Red and green are great combos to us that can see typical colors. But to someone red/green colorblind, it just looks Grey. I use an app to see how the contract is. I work in construction, so my office is 90% male.

I’m colorblind with the most common kind and almost everyone believes it means we can’t “see green” or that “red and green are inverted”. It’s neither of those. While I appreciate the thought here, the vast majority of us who are colorblind have zero issues with apps and such.  Just don’t make your colors be like “red, brick, and maroon are our palette.”</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">When I gave a corporate training presentation on accessibility for a group of about fifty employees.. I had two separate people send me messages later that it was from my slides and explainer that they learned they were color blind as adults in their 30’s.  They later confirmed it with their eye doctors. 

It simply isn’t always screened for. 

Regardless of where the numbers land — it’s a significant enough group that it’s worth being very aware of. The cost of inclusion is very small on this, but the benefit is very high in avoiding misunderstandings on graphs, illustrations, and text formatting. 

Color contrast also is another area where consideration is needed because it also plays into how understandable and readable things are for your whole audience.</div>

TL;DR (comments below) Weekly-Ad9002 and others are pointing out Descartes used this declaration as the foundation of knowledge, and he very much believed in an external materialistic world, going on to help define the scientific methods that would expand technology.

GPT4.5 on the other hand, seems to have gone 'Full Copenhagen' on all us wave functions.</div>

&gt;You know that old joke where a Greek philosopher goes;
&gt;
&gt; “And that is why reality doesn’t exist!”
&gt; 
&gt; And in the next meeting a colleague of his comes in and throws a very heavy rock at his toes and the first philosopher screams in pain and the other one only leans back in his seat and proclaims;
&gt; 
&gt; “That was my refutation!!!”

This is known as the [Appeal to the Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_the_stone), and it wasn't a Greek philosopher who said that, but [Samuel Johnson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Johnson).

Johnson's biographer, James Boswell, wrote about the event this way:

&gt; After we came out of the church, we stood talking for some time together of [Bishop Berkeley's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley) ingenious sophistry to prove the non-existence of matter, and that every thing in the universe is merely ideal. I observed, that though we are satisfied his doctrine is not true, it is impossible to refute it. I never shall forget the alacrity with which Johnson answered, striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone, till he rebounded from it, "I refute it thus."

Of course, this doesn't refute anything.  Both the stone and the pain you experience could be "all in your head" and have no relation to the "outer world" (if there is one) or to mind-independent reality (or "objective reality").. if there is one.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That's based on Samuel Johnson's refutation of Berkeley's subjective idealism. "I refute it thus!" said Johnson and kicked a stone.

There's a similar story told of Greek philosopher Diogenes, who refuted an argument that said movement was impossible by walking away.</div>

By all means do the thing afterward, as long as you take A 5 SECOND pause every time you do it.

I don't do things I don't plan to do. If I am going to do something, I write it down. I find it helps me to consider what is going to be done rather than working off of impulse.

                                <div class="reply-body">As usual, you paint the world black and white and many millions of people just voted because they are the worst kind. Give me a break. So sick of reddit left bias echo chamber who think they have the perfect moral stance. I'd argue that the ones who believe they are moral superior are the most dangerous type. 


So what do the right-wing contribute with? Free speech. Now, unfortunately, the ones who are in power might swing it too far the other way.


But it is just a fact that many normal people (who even voted left) in Europe have been silenced in the mass-immigration question. They turned out to be right. The left media painted everyone in early year 2000 as racist. Which gave birth to the right-wing we see today. 


Which is ironic, because the left created the right-wing and their power. Unfortunately they do not realise that. If they just had some sensible rational, right-wing would not be as popular it is today. And lo and behold: the left wing parties in Europe as now understanding the consequences and taking in the "racist" viewpoints. Somehow in their cognitive dissonance they filter this away.


Point is: They also stand for some good things. But I doubt you can see it honestly. Because you are so filled with binary googles filled of rage and a blind belief that you/your side are moral superior.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">ABSTRACT:  
&gt; Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving complex reasoning tasks through mechanisms like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which emphasizes verbose, step-by-step reasoning. However, humans typically employ a more efficient strategy: drafting concise intermediate thoughts that capture only essential information. In this work, we propose Chain of Draft (CoD), a novel paradigm inspired by human cognitive processes, where LLMs generate minimalistic yet informative intermediate reasoning outputs while solving tasks. **By reducing verbosity and focusing on critical insights, CoD matches or surpasses CoT in accuracy while using as little as only 7.6% of the tokens, significantly reducing cost and latency across various reasoning tasks**.</div>

Furthermore, it should already be possible to make the model think 'in its own way', in the sense that the thought is readable only for the model itself and therefore it is much faster and more intuitive, but dangerous because humans could never understand its meta-thoughts</div>

Edit: to clarify, I meant end the electoral college and have ranked choice voting. So replace what we have now with a ranked choice popular vote. 

I do get that outcomes like the Adams outcome in New York are still possible. 🤦🏼‍♀️ thanks for all the additional voting systems that people have brought up. I’m learning so much!</div>

It was one of the most unethical votes I have ever seen, they coupled it with, and no I'm not fucking kidding, "Only US citizens can vote in MO elections". 

This was already fucking illegal, they changed the language from "All to Only". That's what our misinformed voters voted for. 

So all the rednecks saw that and voted for it, not even realizing they voted to ban ranked choice voting. I could not believe it.</div>

Everyday I get up to scroll instagram reels ( I uninstalled tik tok a while ago) and all I get on my feed are incels. No more funny memes or jokes or cool stuff. It's just incels trying to sell you their course or who eat steak and eggs on a cutting board or either show you their f**ed up political views. Why do this things enrage me so bad? Why do I care so much to the point they make my day worse. I get it I can just scroll or see about my day but ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Recently Dario Amodei said in an interview that Anthropic sees itself more as geared towards enterprise users and thus their consumer features (which web search falls under) have been neglected.

The difficulty is that the real world is messy, and crap data in means faulty results out.  Not to mention people have motivation to subvert accounting practices. Money is a powerful influencer.

An AI program can't take legal responsibility for signing off on accounts.  Not because of some archaic bureaucracy, but because someone has to be accountable.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">In my country, you NEED to hire an accountant to file certain things. It is ILLEGAL to file them without one.

A lot of the accountants here are often lazy and mess things up a ton. Using LLMs you can do much better and more accurate reports and filings, with only a little bit of handholding (and I bet that will change soon too). I say this from experience.

Unfortunately, the state has determined that you, average joe, are too stupid to file your own taxes for certain things, even with the help of AI, so you are FORCED to pay thousands to an accountant to fuck things up for you, or shut down your activities. Oh and btw you're still 100% liable if your accountant fucks things up and you don't notice, and if you do notice you have to pay them extra for them to fix it.

Like if you pass it through three different LLMs, and they get the same answer, you may not need a human evaluator. All you need is either A) the individual costs of running LLMs to go down massively so you can check it thousands of times at say a 70% reliability, or large improvements in capabilities for a few times at a 99% reliability.</div>

If you could just have AI scan through them then verify any areas of concern it could cut the manpower needed for a big audit down by 50%, or more.


Maybe won't get rid of every auditor but it'll sure cut down on the numbers needed.</div>

Thats what’s currently happening to the United States govt. Large scale Silicon Valley VC monopoly takeover underway. Think: uber. Here’s a new product with no oversight, no regulations. And it’s better than taxis. Taxi industry gets wiped out. Uber raises their prices because there’s no one left. I can’t even order a pizza anywhere in the United States for less than a $20 service charge because no one delivers anymore. Only app delivery bullshit, which was originally the price of the tip you’d use for the restaurants delivery guy. 
  
  
These people at the behest of Trump, are gutting the govt and replacing it with an untouchable and all powerful right wing tech fascist apparatus. Control and total power comes from the internet and the people who control it. The right wing motto of “No more regulations no taxes!” Means “no regulations for the big boys. Way more regulations and taxes for the little guys.”
  
  
Trumpers don’t be too hard on yourselves when you realize you got played by a billionaire conman. He’s good at grifting and lying. And he was passed the blueprint by Silicon Valley tech Nazis and was sold on it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">We are being manipulated in every way possible.

The way I view it, simplified as much as I can for this conversation is this:

If we believe in NHI (based on various versions of accounts) then they possess(ed) technology beyond our current scope in an immeasurable way.

If they are alien - they can traverse distances we cannot, in ways we never have.

If they are inter-dimensional - they are from places we cannot comprehend.

If they are time travelers - they are manipulating physics and navigating time space in a way we shouldnt.

So the next logical question is “do we (humans) possess the technology”? Based on various accounts, we do.

Someone out there essentially has, for a lack of a better all encompassing term, “magic”. And if they have “magic”, they have an immeasurable amount of potential or current power.

If these things are real, and someone has them, there is no scenario where “disclosure” comes organically. It only occurs if orchestrated, and if orchestrated, it will never be fully truthful.

Any way you dice it, it’s a literal conspiracy with the absolute largest of stakes on the line.

We are being lied to, we are being manipulated, and there is absolutely nothing we can do about it.

It’s like pulling back the curtain to realize there is a play going on, but behind the theater is another curtain with a playing going on, and on, and on.</div>

It really is sickening to consider huh? The sad state of governance and what we value is forced upon you. The greedy, delusional and psychopathic are at the top of our civilization. They "have the most", so that must mean they're great and better than everyone else.


So when it comes time for a monumental discovery like this with implications for societal and technological uplift, they will utilize their influence and ill-gotten stature to control it in various ways. They will establish themselves "in the space", as we're already seeing. That's Step 1.</div>

It is quite alright if you scoff at me as you would any one of the charlatans entitled in this thread. Catastrophic disclosure is a process, the ball has to start rolling at some point. By the time it spreads enough to trigger their action, much the people will want rid of these Fascists.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Ever notice the circlejerk of confirming to the audience who is a believable figure and who isn't?

Watch Jesse's podcast or any other UFO related media foe that matter and keep your ears peeled whenever they mention somebody who is not with them at that moment.

It's ALWAYS a full 20-30 seconds of "Have you heard about the story of XYZ? Yeah, he's such a good guy. So brave. Such a nice person to be around. So patriotic. I've never met a nicer person."

This is the hosts making sure we - the audience - subconciously develop the same opinion on these people. We go "Hey, Jesse seems like a nice and likable guy, so this other person must be as well, if they get along." And in an instant we are more likely to believe what outlandish claims these people are handing us. 

Also the concept of repeating the same stories again and again in every episode until people think "Hey, I've heard this before, so it's probably the truth."

Psychologists could have a field day with these podcasts.</div>

UFO's as a vector for societal change and attack works best when the UFO community is on offense mode, telling people who's a grifter, who's a liar, why X can't be trusted with Y, whatever works. 

It never works as well in "base building" mode. Nearly 90 years of rhetoric and discussion on the topic and you'll still find as many theories and explanations are people who pay attention, the UFO space is not conducive to "pro-agenda" mass manipulation as much as it is "anti-agenda". 

Think of all the Govt campaigns in this space, never "This is what it is, trust us" only "This is what it isn't, don't trust anyone who says otherwise".

Edit to actually make a point:
It's more likely podcast hosts blow smoke up each others assess to cultivate better access within their communities and economic niches. Humans are social creatures usually, it would make sense that people would act in a pro-social manner if they were invested in their society (UFO community) and not given a reason to be anti-social.</div>

LMArena aims to measure *user preferences.* It shows the user two LLMs for various prompts they input without labeling them and the user picks which response they prefer. It draws from a wide pool of users in terms of expertise, preferences, and interests and partially relies on an honor system so there are benefits for "getting a pulse" on a model but it's not necessarily measuring specific task performance like coding like other benchmarks attempt to. 

TLDR: LMArena is for people to see what models they prefer in blind A/B-type tests.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The way I'd say it is it's the difference between measuring someone's knowledge on difficult exams (coding benchmark) versus how well they vulgarize the subject to others. (user ratings on LMArena).

So  basically this is in line with what we'd expect from everything we've heard, GPT 4.5 is better at communicating in a way that feels natural (emotional intelligence, humor, etc.) as opposed to being an acing elitist nerd (though it could potentially become the best nerd of all by being harnessed into a reasoning model).</div>
