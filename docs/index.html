# Trump's Likely Reaction: Outrage, Then Negotiation

Trump's responses to disloyalty are impulsive and amplified via X (formerly Twitter), where he has over 88 million followers. Expect:

* **Immediate Public Venting**: A fiery X post or two, something like: "Dana White, who I helped build UFC into a BILLION DOLLAR EMPIRE, invites CROOKED OBAMA to an event? Total DISLOYALTY! Sad!" He'd tie it to broader attacks on Obama (e.g., "The same guy who spied on my campaign and wrecked our country"), rallying his base and framing it as an elite snub. This mirrors his 2019 meltdown over White's neutral comments on impeachment or his rants at allies like Lindsey Graham for mild deviations.
* **Private Pushback**: Trump would likely call White directly— they've spoken often, including post-election chats. White's charm and history of smoothing things over (e.g., defending Trump amid controversies) could lead to a quick de-escalation. White might spin it as "good for business" or "unity like Obama showed me," appealing to Trump's ego by reminding him of their shared wins.
* **Longer-Term Fallout**: If White doubles down on bipartisanship, Trump might cool off publicly but stew privately, perhaps skipping a UFC event or shading it in interviews. However, their bond is resilient—Trump forgave White for past "indiscretions" like praising Conor McGregor's global appeal over American fighters. Worst case: Trump promotes a rival MMA league or boasts about "better" events at Mar-a-Lago. Best case: It fizzles into a non-story, with White hosting both at a future White House UFC bash for optics.

In short, it'd sting Trump's pride hard, sparking a classic tantrum, but their loyalty likely ensures it doesn't fracture the alliance. White's recent unity pivot suggests he'd frame the invite as harmless goodwill, not a flip. For real-time vibes, keep an eye on Trump's X feed—it's where these hypotheticals turn real fastest.</div>

I've thought about moving to a GR86 already, but I really don't care for the drivetrain.

                                <div class="reply-body">Subaru hates marketing the BRZ because they prioritize AWD, Safety *then* Sports cars/variants.

Toyota owns 20% of Fuji Heavy Industries, so Subaru didn't have much of a choice during development of the ZC6/ZN6.

Quick search:

"Reports from September 2025 indicate that there will be a future for the Toyota GR86, but it is unlikely to include a third-generation Subaru BRZ in the United States. Multiple sources suggest that the BRZ will be discontinued or go electric, potentially severing the long-standing partnership with Toyota for this sports car."</div>

This means that there is always a lot of pressure on those salespeople to meet their targets at the end of the quarter, and even more so at the end of the year, to meet their annual targets. If you ask for a discount then, more often than not in my experience, you will get it.

Some examples

Going above and beyond to prove people wrong or constantly trying to turn negatives into teaching moments can be exhausting and isn't always necessary. Sometimes it's okay to just acknowledge your frustration and move on without making it a growth opportunity.

The examples you gave are fine for minor annoyances, but this approach can backfire if you're constantly suppressing legitimate boundaries or concerns just to stay positive.</div>

In the industrial revolution displaced workers eventually found work in new sectors. 

But with AI we are talking about algorithms that don’t need breaks, benefits, or replacements. The work just vanishes. So no new jobs.

If workers have no income then how does the capitalist sell products?

                                <div class="reply-body">China had to automate because their running out of surplus labour who want to work in those factories.

And not just for a single reason. Partly due to China move to a service economy. Partly because they have a huge demographic time bomb that is starting to hit them

The factories I know of in China are finding it hard to compete with the service jobs which are far easier, don't require any where near as much travel and which offer better opportunities.

Look i know which sub I'm in but jeebus, AI hasn't stolen millions of jobs in China.</div>

That is why Varoufakis, Harari and others are saying this is a transition from democratic capitalism to techno neo-feudalism. There is no employment in feudalism, there are lords and those who survive off the land.</div>

With world governments willing to restrain trade on behalf of chosen cronies, at best we live in oligarchy today, and transitioning to dictatorship. There will no longer be much need to "sell" anything to the people, you just mandate that they must have it, like car and health insurance. They must pay, no choice except maybe a false one to decide which oligarchy gets your money.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">As someone who uses AI daily in his job, in a job that is/was predicted to be taken over by AI, I can tell you that AI is way over hyped and is nowhere near where you think or the media or hype believe it is. Another thing to consider is that fact that at the moment it's a tool that increases productivity. Replacing people would be the wrong way to go about it since now employees can accomplish much more in a given time period which means, at least theoretically, keeping the headcount would generate more profits.</div>

AI has incredible room to scale and improve from here and as someone who uses AI daily, I think it will displace at least 50% of current first world jobs within the next 20 years. It will start with basic manual labour and knowledge workers. There is a saying in programming that anything you repeat can be automated and AI and robotics makes that a lot easier to implement at scale in the physical world. The process has already started.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">the name Ned just reminded me of Ned Fulmer, one of the try guys from youtube. he cheated on his legit 9/10 wife and released a podcast with her recently and its so painful to watch. I have never watched a video that’s harder to watch. Just thought I’d put this out there because its related to husband/wife theme of this post: https://youtu.be/w0WAkwcPK_8?si=hdhd4KT44SqfZhDa</div>

You can also easily do that without scripting by just making a local git repo and have the AI make a commit and push every change, then run pull on other side and run a build... you can pretty much tell the AI to do anything really</div>

I fired up a GCP E2 micro (free tier), and SSH into that from Termius. Then I run Codex CLI. 

I'm going to write more code with it. I prefer it over ChatGPT Codex, because I have a whole computer to work with. 

It is expected that agents are going to work for longer (see METR chart) so I want to be able to check &amp; run from my phone like my computer.

                        <div class="comment-body">UBI isn't welfare. Welfare is what you give to poor people to keep them trapped in a cycle of poverty in order to guarantee they'll vote for you forever. To get welfare, you have to have income below a certain level. Which means once you reach that exact level, getting a raise or promotion is bad (or at best neutral) for you because you start losing benefits.

UBI is something everybody gets. If you have no other income, you live off your UBI. But if you earn money, no matter how much, you get the exact same UBI. 

If you believe that every person has a right to food, shelter, clothing, health care, etc. you should support UBI because it is the duty of the government to protect the rights of everyone. So we figure out what amount of money is required to provide all those things, and give it to everyone. Then we work if want to do better than just survive.</div>

I support UBI but history has shown time and time again that the mega wealthy would rather let us starve to death in the streets than actually push for equality. I don't see why this time would be different. Even if AI solves all labour needs, many resources are still limited to us for the foreseeable future</div>

Let's take Greece as an example: Say 10k Euro per person, 10 million people, that's 100 billion euro per year. That's roughly the whole government revenue and nearly half the country's GDP.   
  
The only way this could happen is in a completely planned economy, Soviet style - which isn't going to happen in Europe any time soon.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is happening in Europe because the voters want it to. At the moment, most voters are doing fine and don’t feel like they’re going to be jobless soon. BUT, if one day most people needed welfare because they believed there wouldn’t be any more jobs *ever,* then the voting patterns will change again.

This is pretty basic stuff guys. Come on…

You’re looking at a swinging pendulum. And pendulums never swing one direction and stay there forever. Voting patterns have changed given the environment people are voting within. They will change again when the environment changes again. 

How could UBI (or something similar) not win elections under those circumstances? </div>

Cursor typically charges about **20% extra commission** on top of the model’s token usage, and it’s not even transparent about how many tokens you’ve actually used. You can get the **exact same models** on free VS Code extensions like **KiloCode, Cline, or RooCode** — using your model providers' API key or OpenRouter — with a **clear, per-token pricing** scheme and avoid the shady “Cursor tax.”

For me, the **only selling point left for Cursor** ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I recently reverted to using Cursor after experimenting with VS Code. While both editors utilize the same models, Cursor performs a more effective job with autocompletion. It appears to maintain a larger context window, keeping more code in reference.

On the other hand, VS Code occasionally generated properties for database models that were not present in my codebase, and the chat interface failed to comprehend my intended reference, even when I provided custom project instructions. 

So I’m paying more for better context</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Main reason is autocomplete and tab. I do a lot of changes by hand still and it cuts down how long it takes for repetitive changes especially to be made across multiple files a lot. I think the amount of LLM usage I get for 20 usd + that is worth it, though the bulk of the real work I do is via claude code. Auto is good for certain changes, gpt 5 works well enough etc. Just think the overall package is still worth 20 bucks. It's not worth me fucking around with per-token pricing atm.</div>

2026 will be a pivotal year for the widespread integration of AI into the economy:

Models will be able to autonomously work for full days (8 working hours) by mid-2026.

At least one model will match the performance of human experts across many industries before the end of 2026.

By the end of 2027, models will frequently outperform experts on many tasks.</div>

In a recent interview, Netanyahu (Milekowsky) said one of THE MOST important deals is currently happening. 

Can you guess what it is? 

&gt;!The purchase of Tik Tok!&lt;

He said the second most important is the purchase of &gt;!X and goes on to talk about how Elon is a friend.!&lt;

The reason?

&gt;!Control all media!&lt;

                        <div class="comment-body">This is close to home.  Mormon Church - 40 year old male, drove through front door firing rounds.  10 victims, 2 dead so far.   Michigan DNR showed up and neutralized the threat. The church was already set on fire.  Bomb squad is at his residence currently.  FBI and ATF are present.  The church almost burnt to the ground and more are expected to be trapped inside the blaze.  Very sad. Firefighters were inside trying to get people out that I'm guessing were barricaded in when the building started to collapse and they had to pull out. Firefighters could hear people screaming.

Edit* served from 2004-2008. Peer was in band class with him and said he once wore a gold thong to school and showed everyone in class.

Edit 2*. Dove by local airport and there was zero planes on run way. Only an all black helicopter flying in.  Come to find out FFA closed airspace in large part of Michigan.  Just drove 120 miles north and back and seen zero air traffic</div>

Whereas I was going to the gym 6 days a week, I had two separate injuries that seriously caused me to lose muscle and endurance. Going back to the gym, I don't feel their current programming has been effective. The box has open gym all day and the owner has graciously given me access to the gym after hours for my schedule. I am looking for recommendations of programming that will take me back to where I was before these injuries.

1st injury was after the Open. The first WOD after the last Open WOD, my hamstrings seized up when I deadlifted (a weight that I had been able to do). That took me out for about a month. When I finally came back, felt I was doing OK.

2nd injury (not really an injury) was after the Community Cup. After attempting a front squat, left leg stiffed up and walking was a chore. That also set me back about a month.

Trying to keep up with Rx is a task these days and Rx+ is sometimes out of the question, even though before I was able to.</div>

I've been keeping a very close eye on all of the agentic code tools since they came out and have had, at various points, enormous success and enormous frustration with most of them. 

I've been using Linux for many years, but personally, I'd much rather use a nice GUI than a CLI given the option (mostly remembering syntax for a bunch of CLIs is what I find hard!)

I started out with Windsurf but have been scratching my head at the ups and downs during the time I've been using it. I...</div>

I hear people talking sometimes and just know they are simply regurgitating what their personal algorithm has been feeding them for years. That is the world to them, it's their reality. Generally speaking of course, people over the age of about 50 seem to have the hardest time separating reality from what algorithms are feeding them. They are completely all in and their online algorithm bubble is the real world to them. I'm not just talking one side or the other politically I'm talking complete world views from every walk of life.

Both right and left algorithms are a surprisingly small group of people. Rogan's self-proclaimed "Bullshit Filter" is no match for the relentless consumption of his echo chamber (Ironically, the thing he warned so much against).

The ONLY time Rogan deviates from the right-wing narrative is when Glenn Greenwald takes a stance on the 1st amendment OR if it affects him directly. The recent Kimmel cancellation combined both of those.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Just yesterday, here in the venerable r/joerogan, somebody stated as a fact that there were already pregnant liberal women who have died from liver damage due to taking massive doses of Tylenol to "own the conservatives".

They really believe that this shit is real. They really think pregnant women said YOLO and started chewing Tylenol like Skittles and killed themselves and their unborn babies for some vague parasocial "owning".

People really broke their brains out here</div>

As far as I can tell on the timeline and social media reaction: annoucment made by gov, people meme chugging Tylenol, the right misses the satire and thinks all libs are now chugging Tylenol, they do what trump says and they assume all libs do the opposite so now we have tik toks of people pretending to drink urine and eat feces because they project their logic onto others and if trump said it was bad then libs would do that thing... their perception of reality is quite something.
