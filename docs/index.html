Needle in the Haystack isn't reliable, as noted in another comment here, so we tend to use [Fiction LiveBench](https://fiction.live/stories/Fiction-liveBench-Mar-25-2025/oQdzQvKHw8JyXbN87). Quasar noticeably degrades far quicker than Gemini 2.5, though isn't the worst model in the list. 59% at 120k.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">become so busy with other things you straight up don't have time for social media

it can be hard to motivate yourself to do things. but when something works on you, do the crap out of it. for instance you might find it quite hard to just decide to work out and then work out. but what if you sign up for a class and pay for it and it has an exact time and place to be? if you're like me you'll probably go. so, do that! or try setting up things like:

* workout buddies
* book clubs
* appointments with things like a physiotherapist where you want to show progress between sessions

also try going through just one 'insanely busy time' where you deliberately schedule a bit more than you think you can handle so the ONLY way you can get through will be to focus on that stuff and forget about social media for a few weeks. Break that hold and be so busy that even if you feel like you're in 'withdrawal' you still don't have time for it. we might think, going a day without it is so hard, if i go a month without it, i'll EXPLODE! but actually if you go a month without it you will realize that yes one more day is actually easy.

also some other less known tips that have helped me:

* get some other devices so you're not using your phone and computer for everything. an alarm clock, radio/mp3 player, ereader. the less you touch a device that can connect to social media, the longer you can go without using it.d

* instead of thinking it as a TEMPTATION to RESIST, think of it as something so BORING and CRAPPY you'd rather do ANYTHING ELSE. we succumb to temptations. but we avoid boring and crappy things, as long as we're actively thinking of those things that way.

* keep your phone on silent as much as possible, keep it greyscale and the screen dim. put your charger in an inconvenient place like a closet so you can't just permascroll all day. consider only charging your phone enough to get you through the bare minimum usage. 

* you don't need infinite discipline. you can still do quick fun things. but make them quick fun FINITE things with defined end points like a movie, a book, a puzzle.  

* schedule yourself a bit because if you have no specific thing you should be doing, you'll probably end up scrolling or just consuming content in some way. i personally like pomodoros (25 minutes on, 5 minute break) and 'double pomodoros' (50 minutes on, 10 minutes off, which for me was my basic university class schedule so i am very used to those time frames). thinking you are going to grind something for hours can be daunting. just challenging yourself to do as much as you can before the next break  can get you in the zone and make sure you forget all about how you might have been doomscrolling instead. and an important thing here is the BREAK is not a quick check of social media and email. it is to prepare for your NEXT session, so you just do things like use the bathroom, refresh you glass of water, stretch a bit, maybe take a walk around the block to clear your mind.

If you have some goals it is not beyond the possible at all to just schedule four or five pomodoros and bang them all out in a two hour block. also if some things are too strenuous to do every day you can rotate, like maybe you do weightlifting 4 days a week and cardio 3 days a week. 

* just like you want to  make doomscrolling hard, do the opposite for the things you actually want/need to be doing. make them laughably easy to start. so appealing that you find it HARD TO RESIST rather than something you need to majorly psych yourself up for. you know how those people who seem to 'have it all together' are super extra about what they do? like they don't just work out, they have great workout outfits and equipment and a nice bottle for smoothies and water and good headphones for working out etc? it's not just because they're super dedicated, it makes it EASIER and MORE ENJOYABLE for them to do those activities. They're not just thinking ugh a workout... do i HAVE to? they're thinking oh sweet time to put on that nice gear, and i'll get to drink one of those great shakes when it's done, and vibe to some new tracks, hell yeah. gonna be hard work though but it's not all bad.

i discovered the power of making things tempting rather than work when i was struggling with getting out of bed on my days off work. i tried all the things like putting an alarm across the room, or drinking lots of water before bed so i had to get up to pee. i would literally just go back to bed after doing those things anyway. it was only when i started making my mornings SO EASY and TEMPTING that i harnessed my lazy animal brain for my own good with a nice breakfast, nice drinks, an episode of a comedy show queued up, stuff like that. outwit your animal self, get that lazy dopamine chasing lab rat part of your brain ON YOUR SIDE. Or another metaphor I use, imagine yourself as a Sim from the Sims, make it so your ONLY real options are good things and you will do good things.

* there will be times when you falter and fail. the key in those moments is to catch yourself when you're spiraling into self pity talk like 'oh no i always do this, i always fail! i'm such a LOSER!" From now on, your are not a loser. YOU unequivocally KNOW you have an IRON WILL. And so when you find yourself engaging in a bad habit you don't doom spiral, you brush it off and think 'whoops, that's not like me at all' and you put yourself back on track so fast that you forget you were ever off.</div>

I am hopeful but it sounds fishy.

edit: I guess it's because they lack the lab equipment to carry out the experiments themselves, but I feel like they'd still want their hand in these sorts of developments, maybe by leasing lab space or hiring 3rd party workers.</div>

He admitted to me that he sucked as a cop because he was just a decent dude doing a job, didn’t care unless he saw something blatantly illegal. In his words “I was lazy and didn’t care because most people just had some issues they were working through”

                        <div class="comment-body">"In his meeting with President Nayib Bukele today in the White House, President Donald Trump told his Salvadoran counterpart that ‘home-growns are next’ and that El Salvador would ‘need to be build about five more places’ to hold American citizens.”

The President is directly saying he intends to send US citizens to concentration camps while also saying he can do this without any due process and while ignore the Supreme Court's instructions to stop and return an innocent man.

                                <div class="reply-body">My copy-paste today, because I truly think we’re in a state of emergency:

The SC decision unequivocally stated that due process is owed to ALL detainees, regardless of citizenship status. They are ignoring that. 

The administration ramped up rhetoric today to say that:
- They want US citizens to go to CECOT.
- They’re going to clamp down on un-American speech.
- They’re also not complying with a separate court order to allow AP in the press pool.   

They’re leaping forward with Project 2025 in a coordinated way.

We need to IMMEDIATELY boycott, [mass call Congress for impeachment](https://5calls.org), start the [general strike](https://generalstrikeus.com), and [mobilize for mass protest](https://www.mobilize.us/).</div>

These people are absolute scum. They always have been.

If you have ever spent time with people who support conservatives and specifically Trump behind closed doors, the mask comes off almost immediately. They cant help it either. The things i heard growing up were absurd, and this was in suburban upper middle class America. College educated, life long conservatives just spewing the most absurd hate speech and supremacist rhetoric you could imagine. Bragging about it.</div>

&gt;They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-45, by Milton Mayer"

&gt;Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk alone; you don’t want to “go out of your way to make trouble.” Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.

&gt;Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, “everyone” is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, “It’s not so bad” or “You’re seeing things” or “You’re an alarmist.”
And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.

&gt;But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.

&gt;But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions, would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the “German Firm” stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all of the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.

&gt;And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying “Jewish swine,” collapses it all at once, and you see that everything has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.

&gt;Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven’t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early morning meetings of your department when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late. You are compromised beyond repair.</div>

Turns out, I was just doing more of the wrong things.

The real change happened when I stopped doing these 3 things:

1. Checking my phone first thing in the morning
It ruined my focus before the day even began.
Now I don’t touch it for the first 30 minutes after I wake up.


2. Writing long to-do lists I never finished
I now focus on just 3 high-impact tasks per day. That’s it.
Simplicity &gt;Stress.


3. Waiting to feel motivated
