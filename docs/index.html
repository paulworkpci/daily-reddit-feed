# Plausible there will be convincing proof of NHI tech within months

[Timestamp 31:32](https://youtu.be/DFdU18prEhU?t=1292):

If I said I can talk to fish and they always obey me, it would take less than a month to convince most of the world. And that's without starting with a decent platform, a billionaire backing me up and a whole team of people working with me.</div>

Coulthart and Corbell and all the others claim to have irrefutable proof of world-changing information, claim they can't release it because they'll get in trouble with the government, but we're all supposed to believe the government is fine with them pushing this methodical, multi-year walk over the line? If they were holding on to information as sensitive as they claim, they wouldn't be able to say even the things they're saying now. 

And if these things are as verifiable as they claim, they would rip the bandaid off and do it over night.

Especially for Barber. Bro you can summon a UAP but you can't convince the New York Times to come film you doing it, verify the veracity, and then interview you about it? Bull. Shit.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Microsoft engineers are currently readying server capacity for OpenAI’s upcoming GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 models, according to a source familiar with the company’s plans. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged recently that GPT-4.5 will launch within a matter of weeks, I understand that Microsoft is expecting to host the new AI model as early as next week.

Codenamed Orion, GPT-4.5 is OpenAI’s next frontier model and the company’s last non-chain-of-thought model. OpenAI has already teased that GPT-4.5 could be a lot more powerful than GPT-4, but the company is also looking ahead to its GPT-5 model that will include more significant changes.

I’m told that Microsoft is expecting GPT-5 in late May, which aligns with Altman’s promise of the next-gen model arriving within a matter of months. As always, this date could shift if release plans change. We reported in October that OpenAI was originally planning to release GPT-4.5 by the end of 2024, but this was subsequently delayed to early 2025.

GPT-5 will likely be the more significant release out of the pair, and Altman has referred to it as a “system that integrates a lot of our technology.” It also includes OpenAI’s new o3 reasoning model, which the company teased during its 12 days of Christmas announcements in December.

While OpenAI released o3-mini last month, OpenAI is no longer planning to ship o3 as a standalone model, and it will instead be integrated into this GPT-5 system. This aligns with OpenAI’s goal to combine its large language models to eventually create a more capable model that could be labeled as artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

This updated GPT-5 system will also include significant improvements to the way you use ChatGPT, unifying OpenAI’s o-series and GPT-series models to reduce some of the confusion of knowing which model to pick for which task or query. “We hate the model picker as much as you do and want to return to magic unified intelligence,” said Altman in a post on X recently.

If OpenAI manages to ship GPT-5 in time for late May, it would align well with Microsoft’s Build developer conference — which starts on May 19th and will go head-to-head with Google I/O that week. Altman appeared onstage at Microsoft Build last year, just days after OpenAI released GPT-4o as a faster model that was free for all ChatGPT users.

I reported last year that OpenAI’s GPT-4o release surprised some teams at Microsoft because it undermined Microsoft’s own paid-for AI services on Azure, which include speech and translation features. The GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 releases should come as less of a surprise, and I’m expecting the software maker to be ready with Copilot updates shortly after OpenAI’s latest launch. Microsoft gave Copilot a big redesign in October, just months after OpenAI released GPT-4o.

Much like OpenAI, Microsoft has also been working to improve Copilot’s model picker so that it’s easier for users to interact with the AI assistant without having to select the AI model powering those interactions. Microsoft used to have “creative,” “balanced,” and “precise” options to help control model output, but it scrapped those with the big Copilot overhaul last year. In January, Microsoft added a “Think Deeper” button that uses OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model to answer queries.

Microsoft is also working on its own version of OpenAI’s new Operator AI agent that can do things on the web for you. Operator can interact with GUIs on webpages, allowing it to automatically take action for you. It’s a similar concept to a macro that can automate tasks or an autopilot system on aircraft that doesn’t require constant attention from a human.

I’m expecting a host of AI announcements from Microsoft over the coming months, particularly at Build in May, where it gets to present its latest technology to the developers building AI apps and products. Microsoft has been focused heavily recently on the capabilities of its AI agents, and I’ve heard that teams have been trying to reduce the costs involved to make them even more appealing to businesses.

Microsoft Build and Google I/O also overlap this year, so expect to see both companies try to one-up each other on AI announcements — particularly with GPT-5 set to debut around the same time.</div>

I believe I am struggling with social media addiction, especially ytube, sometimes spending up to 10 hours a day. It is making me feel worse and worse as the days go by. I feel like I am falling behind compared to my peers. I have so much to learn and do, so I am quitting all social media, including LinkedIn, and refraining from watching movies and listening to music. I will let you know the results of these changes.

wish me luck lol.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">i quit social media 2 years ago, i deleted instagram, tiktok, twitter, youtube from my phone but i kept the accounts just for when i need to check something (which its not usual). Also, what i did with youtube was that i paused the history (both)  so it couldnt give me recommendations in the homepage, and therefore i also had no youtube shorts. I still use pinterest sometimes and reddit but i dont find them as addicting, and whatsapp of course (if it counts).

You are going to get distracted anyway but with other stuff, dont think this is going to be a magical solution and you are automatically going to get disciplined. But it sure saves you A LOT of time and brainrotting.</div>

Not that you need any advice, but I recommend you make sure to focus on other things. I believe to remove a habit/behavior, you need to replace it with something else. So focus more on whatever you're passionate about and get more serious about it. 

  
Good luck! You're doing something great for yourself.</div>

Anyone thinking that just one of the parties has dirty laundry is naïve to say the least. And this has nothing to do with current politics, this been happening for decades so unless this person selectively exposes a few things here and there to come down on one side of the political spectrum, nothing will come from this.</div>

You will never hear about how Allen Dulles was the head of the CIA while his brother John Foster Dulles was the Secretary of State. Or how their grandfather was Secretary of State John Dulles. Or how his brother in law was Secretary of State Robert Lansing.

How many American families can boast of having THREE men who became Secretary of State?

The Deep State is responsible for a century of American imperialism in Latin America.</div>

It's textbook and it boggles my mind that half of Americans are so dumb as to believe that this particular group of kleptocrat ghouls have anything other than enslavement of the untermensch in mind.
The other half should seriously start doing that armed militia thing which the founders of the nation were so adamant about, with this specific set of events in mind.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The US has for decades promoted hatred and division between post-Soviet nations. That has been the CIA playbook for decades. That's very true.




But I also don't understand why the hatred and division is only blamed on one side, even when the opposite side has done the same, if not worse.


Who forced the current Russian regime to spread dehumanising propaganda about Ukrainians on their state TV and social media for decades? "Khоkhоls"? "Ukrоps"? Imagine there was a slur against all Texans and memes showing how ridiculous are.


Right now, it's these memes which are used to justify the stupid invasion and to prevent Russians from empathising with another Post-Soviet population.






In reality Putin himself helps the goals of the Western establishment, more nations has joined NATO than before he rose to power, and no one else destroyed as much Soviet cities as he did. I absolutely don't understand how all the conspiracies involving Western involvement in Eastern Europe somehow completely miss or ignore him. 










(Edit : This has also been the message of my main post on r/Conspiracy, which unfortunately was downvoted to hell, probably by this very CIA establishment which wants to prevent people from discovering the real truth. Please check it out and reply to it because unfortunately, currently, it's downvoted to oblivion and as such, ignored completely.)</div>

edit: I do think following news can turn into doomscrolling, but "check it only once a day and stay out of the comment section" is a more reasonable way to get a handle on that than carping about the evil MSM.</div>

I try to leave supportive and helpful comments but if I go in to a thread and it’s already chock full of venom, I usually just keep my mouth shut to avoid getting yelled at by somebody who’s already mad and is now extra mad that I’m not mad with them.

Btw, are you THE Pervocracy? Like, the blogger? If so, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart! When I was 16-18, your blog shaped my expectations and beliefs about consent and everything related to it. And that’s really good news because I was one of those catastrophically precocious girls who got surrounded by evil skeletons, like, four seconds after I stepped into high school. Thank you! My life would’ve been a lot worse for a lot longer if it weren’t for you!

This particular post/thread is the most sane one I’ve seen in weeks.  I can’t tell (well We can’t tell anymore, usually) whether bots or not, but the guys (teens? Not sure) posting lately about the sickening disgusting morose Redditors is just wild.  Every word dripping with hatred for what is very clearly themselves, and it’s not even slightly concealed, other than from the poster themselves.  It’s sad but man I hope this can become a helpful place again.  Not another outlet of *manosphere “self improvement”* mental aesthetics.</div>

To paraphrase, they said there are no wrong decisions. There are just the decisions you make. And after that, you have whatever new information to make the next decision, and so on. But instead of being frozen and not sure what to choose, just make a choice and then adjust. 

I think of it often.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That's an interesting way to put it—no wrong decisions made, just decisions. A wise person once told me that if I am struggling between two decisions, neither is a bad decision. Otherwise, it would be a clear choice. So both are good! This perspective can give so much freedom from regret!

I think u/Quantumedphys makes a good distinction, which really boils down to just looking at the bigger picture. It is so simple, but we (I) can sometimes forget that when there appears to be difficulty in making a decision. 

I like the combination of both of these ideas. I choose both!</div>

Instead of traditional time blocking, started grouping tasks by energy type:

* "Explorer Mode" (creative) = Ad concepts, feature planning
* "Farmer Mode" (steady) = Emails, team management
* "Rest Mode" (recovery) = Actually taking breaks and all else

                        <div class="comment-body">This is not an uncommon observation. There are books about this (e.g. Chris Bailey talks about this). However, I'd argue that blocking time by "energy vibe" instead of "duration" is still a special form of "time management." Personally, I've been doing something similar for years. I don't call it "energy types" but "work session types." But the idea is similar: let your current context (energy levels, moods, mental states) determine what type of work to tackle next.</div>

He would invite on full blown white nationalists because "sunlight is the best disinfectant and everyone needs to see how dumb their ideas are".

Thats the excuse he used to signal boost Candace Owens, Steven Crowder, Saargon of Akad, etc. 

But now that he is a republican he knows better then to invite a left winger, likely one who is infinitely more informed then him, on the show just to make him look stupid. 

Joe stopped being down for that about 400 million dollars ago.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is why I always say - in these hypothetical situations when we say “if Obama did this the Republicans would be furious” - it’s important to end that sentence with “and they’d be right”.

So much of politics these days comes down to people needing to feel like they’re right, and automatically becoming defensive if they think someone is telling them they’re wrong. 

If we’re doing these hypotheticals and saying “this is how you’d feel”, we’d reach more people by saying “this is how you’d feel, and you’d be right to feel that way”. It also goes some way to showing “that’s why we are so outraged by this when it’s your guy doing it”.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Let's put it this way

In the summer of 2015, the right was convinced that the US army had turned traitor, and sworn eternal allegiance to only Obama.

Obama was going to use only 2100 of these soldiers to invade, conquer, and occupy Texas (Pop 30 Million) like it was France, and turn it into the first part of the Obamunist Empire

The GOP believed this to the point that the Texas government ordered a partial mobilization of the Texas state guard to 'monitor' the US army.

At no point did Obama make any sort of joke or tweet about doing this.

EDIT, sorry, I got the number of troops wrong, it wasn't 2100, it was 1200.</div>

He never once hinted at that yet Trump and his minions have actually tried to get him a third term and its crickets from the right. Actually they support it.


They only care about the constitution when they are attacking the left. The right can do whatever they want.


EDIT: MAGA cultists are triggered because they don't understand the difference between an obvious joke told on a comedy show and politicians actually trying to get the rapist who shits himself an actual 3rd term....and "beyond". Fucking idiots.</div>

The same as if they joked about loving young women with Epstein. 

The same as if they (especially Obama, you know why), had 7 kids with 3 women. 

The same as if they paid a porn star for sex while their wife was 8 months pregnant. 

The same as if they didn’t show up to the next presidents inauguration and instead held an insurrection. 

The same as if they admitted to grabbing women by the pussy because men in power are allowed. 

The same as if they constantly sided with dictators over democracies.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This really does feel like the beginning of something very special. I'm a cognitive neuroscientist, and generally scientists don't hype things without good reason. I am stunned that this lab felt so strongly about the potential that they got in touch with the media. This has been 10 years of their lives, a whole lab, and in 2 hours they get the same hypothesis and 4 more to boot. 

I think biosciences are going to be revolutionised in the next couple of years. Couple this with alphafold and novel individualized treatments are going to be the norm. Exciting times!</div>

Incorporate AGI into nano technology......the possibilities are endless. We must demand that AGI/ASI not be pay-walled or controlled by one entity. Discussion about any sentient beings' existence should hopefully be initiated. Any attempt to suppress technology that would benefit humanity should be publicly identified and documented on the blockchain for all to see. Knowledge is a birthright for all humans. We profit off of suffering, the future is now, and we can solve most of the world's problems with a little collaboration and empathy.

Of course all of us in a “ UFO Reddit group” will be focused on the possibilities but I really don’t see the general public waking up to the theories proposed in these groups on social media. The way things have moved towards PSI I feel is likely to create even more scepticism in the general public.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That’s a fair pushback, but let’s zoom out for a second. How do we measure a shift in consciousness? It’s not necessarily about *everyone* suddenly believing in remote viewing or UFOs—it’s about subtle but undeniable changes in the cultural landscape.

1. **Mainstream Acknowledgment** – A decade ago, UFOs were a joke. Now, the U.S. government openly admits they exist (even if they downplay the implications). Institutions that once mocked this topic now have to address it seriously.

2. **The Rise of Psychedelics &amp; Consciousness Studies** – In the 1960s, psychedelics were demonized. Now? Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, neuroscientists, and even the military (with remote viewing research and psychedelic-assisted therapy) are openly exploring altered states of consciousness. Consciousness itself is being re-examined as something more than just brain chemistry.

3. **The Algorithmic Rabbit Hole Effect** – Sure, we’re on an *"UFO Reddit group,"* but Reddit, YouTube, and TikTok algorithms are pushing **alternative paradigms** more than ever. Quantum mechanics, simulation theory, and consciousness studies are bleeding into the mainstream. Hell, even figures like Elon Musk and corporate execs are discussing these ideas casually.

4. **Declining Trust in Institutions** – People don’t just trust government statements anymore. The blind faith in "official narratives" has been fractured. That skepticism opens the door to people **asking deeper questions**—not just about UFOs but about everything we take for granted.

5. **Pop Culture as a Reflection of the Shift** – Sci-fi and consciousness themes aren’t just niche anymore; they’re everywhere. Media like *Everything Everywhere All at Once*, *The Matrix Resurrections*, and even Marvel’s obsession with the multiverse are feeding mass audiences ideas that, a few decades ago, would’ve been considered pure “woo.”

That said, skepticism **will** always exist. That’s not a bad thing—it’s part of the process. But the real change isn’t whether *everyone* wakes up at once. It’s that **the conversation is happening in spaces it never could before**. The fact that the U.S. government has had to address UFOs at all means the control over the narrative is slipping.

The real question: **What happens when enough people start thinking for themselves?**</div>
