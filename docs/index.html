The optimal solution here would be to set up a trust that ensures the parents have a comfortable income for the rest of their lives, with no chance of them losing the money to scammers or begging relatives.</div>

But I‚Äôd definitely make sure their house is paid off, cars paid off, bills taken care of, etc.

Because their real motivation is [hatred and spite](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/8/18173678/trump-shutdown-voter-florida), in part due to their [low emotional intelligence](https://www.psypost.org/people-with-lower-emotional-intelligence-are-more-likely-to-hold-right-wing-views-study-finds/).

The GQP just voted in more tax cuts, despite [decades of proof that trickle-down doesn't work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics#Economic_analyses_of_the_effects_of_lowering_taxes_on_the_wealthy).

                                <div class="reply-body">Long story short - Canada had a similar scheme for immigrants, which attracted A LOT of people from Asia, particularly China, Korea, India, Pakistan, even Iran, Lebanon .. etc. Asia is huge, and got a never ending supply of wealthy families.

Billions poured into the economy, every wealthy parent in Asia sent their kid to Canada as a student, or they came in as a family.

Lots of capital came into the Canadian banking system, and was a net positive for the economy and  businesses.

Disadvantage would be that it accelerated the housing crises as property values grew ten fold (literally), as all immigrants bought houses to live in and at times bought multiple investment properties. Most of these immigrants DID NOT cut ties to their homeland, as they are uber-rich, they kept their factories and businesses in Asia alive, and travelled between the two countries. At times, the family went back completely after getting the passport. If they did stay, their kids though, did eventually settle in Canada.

I am not sure if the program is alive today, but was a big deal a decade ago.</div>

I'm sure their shareholders will be super impressed by the 2k savings and their stock will go up. Plus they can abuse the living fuck outta those workers because they don't want to lose their gold card sponsorship. 

That's all this is. A way to help billionaires outsource jobs to foreigners to pad their wallet and have a more compliant workforce. I can't cum any more after this last few weeks, a guy can only handle so much winning.</div>

Pluto represents transformation, power, death and rebirth. Aquarius rules technology, knowledge, the collective, and air. 

We are already seeing this take effect with disruptions to air travel, bird flu, rockets, drones, UFOs, etc. Nuclear war might be in the mix.

So that means pretty soon children being born will have a different Neptune compared to the recent years. Neptune represents how a generation handles adversity in society. For example my bf born in the late 80s is a Sagittarius Neptune and they tend to be the types to say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not ok, make it right‚Äù. Whereas I‚Äôm Neptune in Capricorn so generally a ‚Äúroll with the punches‚Äù type less likely to take issues with what‚Äôs happening. 

Neptune in Aries kids should be interesting.</div>

The user is thanking me for my response. I have to determine how to respond. I can go with ‚ÄúNo Problem‚Äù but that seems like I am not open to future question. Perhaps I should invite future questions, such as adding ‚Äúlet me know if you need anything else‚Äù. However, the user might be saying thank you to end the conversation. I think I will go with something in the middle such as ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very welcome. If you need anything in the future, I‚Äôll be here‚Äù.

1o: You‚Äôre very welcome. If you need anything in the future, I‚Äôll be here.</div>

**I don't give a FLYING FUCK about any of the other topics on this Task Force. I want to know about Non-Human Intelligence and the government cover up of Non-Human Intelligence. The most important news story in human history.**

**We the UFO community made the UAP Caucus relevant and influential in order to get answers on UAPs. We will make you irrelevant again if you fail to bring 100% priority on this issue.**

For me, journaling has been a game-changer‚Äîit helps me clear my thoughts, track progress, and stay focused on my goals.

                        <div class="comment-body">Pick 2 or 3 tasks to do everyday that you have to complete no matter what.  Ideally these are related to things you are passionate about.  For me it looks like this 

Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: 
Hit the gym (first thing in the morning)
Go for a run (first thing after work, don‚Äôt take a break when you get home, this is important) 
Work on side projects / job hunt / relax

Tuesday, Thursday: 
Hit the gym (first thing in the morning always)
Go to the golf course after work to practice / play
Side projects / job hunt / relax

I‚Äôm a very structured person so this works well for me, but it also aligns with things I am passionate about (fitness, golf, career / projects) which means I don‚Äôt dread it.  I will always complete at least the first two things on the list, and give some leniency to the last one depending on how I‚Äôm feeling.</div>

How should corporate even keep up with all this? Companies dont consist of exchangaeble numbers, but of real people who havd to adapt and implement it.  
Furthermore, prices are going down due to competition and open source. Look how the former 200$ GPT is now for free (i think). And this will remain the same for future models.  
Im not saying that AI is a bubble, but i see the bubble in the evaluation of all these startups. VC and Fonds are bubbling the bubble up.</div>

The thing with Topaz is that people look plasticy and the lower quality the original photo or video, the plasticier it looks. It works best when you have a high quality photo where you‚Äôve slightly missed focus or have slight lens or motion blur.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/MFLUDER:

Submission statement: New photos of Steven Spielberg directing his new UFO movie in New Jersey this week with Emily Blunt and Wyatt Russell.  
  
The movie's "codename" is "Non-View" and the title is rumored to be "The Dish" or "Disclosure".  
  
Blunt and Wyatt were seen "grasping each other‚Äôs hands and embracing" while "filming a smoky scene at a gas station".  
  
Spielberg's sci-fi film is set to release in June 2026.

It's also rumored that UFO "whistleblowers" who've grabbed news headlines over the last few years are advisors on Spielberg's film. One of them, Lue Elizondo, was recently seen in New Jersey.  
  
Elizondo's UFO book, originally titled "Disclosure", was released in August 2024 via a book deal brokered by Spielberg producer Dan Farah.   
  
Farah also brokered the book deal for "Ready Player One", which was then turned into a movie directed by Steven Spielberg.  
  
Elizondo stars in a new UFO documentary premiering at SXSW in March. The doc is directed by... Dan Farah.

you know when a singular 1 day has this much news and it still feels like a pretty slow day that we're in major breakneck acceleration speeds (granted this AI newsletter I run does include leaks so not 100% of these are strictly announced things by company officials but most are legit and I only use the highest quality model credible sources for leaks)</div>

Nearly all other robotics demos have relied on scripted movements and teleoperation.

The figure robots on the other hand were able to do what they did because of an AI that knows how to reason about what actions it should take and decides its own movements in real time.

Figure is the closest we‚Äôve gotten to robots that can actually autonomously carry out general tasks.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Society has definately changed and techology has had a big huge role in that change , I have experienced the same things. Prior to all these apps people would be so invested in all areas of life.

I remember we would look through photo albums while granny cooked, and everyone danced, and then we would eat a meal everyone was around even in all the toxicness we were deeply connected. Now everyones on there phones the whole time barely talking and when we do not one is engaged or they are taking pics for social media it's quite heartbreaking actually</div>

Why can't we just idk, walk by the park or something??? Something small, idc. People need purposes to get off their tech these days. Without purpose, they find it wasteful. Wasteful to hangout with your family??? You don't have to meet them only during holidays!

What's disheartening is that, as a gay gal, hearing lesbian bars closing all over the country is just sad. People use to go out even when they're discriminated against, ostracized, even during the worst decades to be marginalized. Nowadays gay folks are more accepted than ever and here we are, barely talking to each other. Now lesbian specific spaces are all dead. Disheartening.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'll try to give my POV on this.

I've said it on this sub before, but I was a computer geek before it was cool. I had tons of hours of screentime when it was very uncool to do.

While places like Myspace and Facebook and Twitter existed, they weren't near super mainstream success yet. At this time the Internet was mostly text based with the occasional photo or low resolution video. This is because you often had to use an external image host, and because of that a lot of pre 2010s images are lost media.

At the time it was mostly a shameful secret of mine. I'd joke that I didn't have a life and I was addicted to my laptop. This was before I ever owned a smartphone.

What did I do back then? Talk in forums, hang out in public chat rooms, play flash games, browse websites, join in communities. Occasionally read a web comic or look through art galleries.

The reason I mention this is to give a general idea of what it looked like before endless scroll or doomscrolling or algorithms.

Over time I've gradually seen the normalization of screen addiction. What used to be considered a niche and nerdy addiction became more mainstream.

But instead of debating in forums or editing memes in photoshop, it was debating on social media and making trending videos.

Sometimes I wish I had made more effort to be social when things were cheaper and people were more social. But I was too afraid to. I was too afraid of messing up and being made fun of. I regret not enjoying my youth more. But I was too depressed to see the bright side.

The reason why I keep talking online about it is because I've seen where doomscrolling ends. And I don't like it.

So I hope if we continue to talk about it maybe some day things will get better.

I do like the distance online conversation gives me. But I also understand that IRL socialization is important too.

I was an extremely lonely 20 something. I was pretty pathetic. I'd often be at home on my computer, not out socializing or making memories. And now all those friends I made online are gone. They never said goodbye. All I have are fading memories of the before times.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I was an early adopter too, was glued to my screen in the early 2000s as a kid and teen. Making webpages, playing Neopets, browsing forums, sharing art online, talking with online friends on AIM. I miss that internet: it was a time when it really did feel like an online *world*, with spaces people where gathered, and you could connect with people on the basis of your ideas and creations. 

Now, the mainstream internet feels so passive, like something you consume. Conversation are fleeting. So much of the content is like high school on steroids: mean-spirited, appearance-centric, subtly enforcing social norms all the time. It's not the haven it used to be, but I still find myself reaching for it, as if I think there's a way to get back to that online world I grew up with.

I do wish that I'd spent more time offline during those years, though. I sort of had to manually learn a bunch of social skills I'd missed out on as a teenager. Having been so addicted at the time, I feel like I have a different perspective on what's happening now compared to the mainstream that accepts it as normal. I wonder if it's the same for you?</div>
