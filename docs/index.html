I think I was in my early teens when I realized I didn't really believe the stuff that was being taught in church, but my dad was a deacon so we went every weekend. I struggled for years trying to figure out what I believed and convincing myself that I wasn't bad for not believing in a god. When I moved in with my mom when I was 16, I never had to go again because she is an atheist. She actually went to church when she was married to my dad but she didn't believe any of it either. Also my dad stopped going a few years after I moved out,  because he said that it was his job as a parent to get us to go and that job was over. And he's never been back.</div>

My experience with religion differs quite a lot compared to most people. During my childhood, I went to church only when "tradition needed it". This means during Christmas, baptism, weddings, etc. At no point was it about religion

This meant for me that I grew up believing that religion just was a part of history, but not something people would take serious. The only reason people went to church was because it was tradition to go, but not because people actually believed in it

It wasn't until I was \~10 years old I realized people actually believe in religion</div>

But after I was bat mitzvahed my parents said it wouldn’t be fair if I didn’t go while my brother had to. So I had to wait three years until he was bar mitzvahed. 

I think his service was the last I went to. 

I’d be questioning religion since I was seven. Having me still go until I was 15 didn’t make me more religious. It made me hate and loathe religion.

                        <div class="comment-body">I was a regular church goer for most of my life, as was my wife.  Kids baptized, active in choir, taught bible study, volunteer efforts, the works.

When my wife was diagnosed with metastatic cancer her treatments became very rough and her health deteriorated rapidly.  This was pre-Obamacare days and she wasn’t covered under my employers insurance plan due to pre-existing condition clauses.  We had been tithing regularly and were giving extra towards the churches new building fund.  We had to stop that to make ends meet but still tithed what we could.  The senior pastor contacted us and asked why and I told him and he asked if he and the deacons could do a special prayer session for her health.  

We showed up to the session, laying on of hands and whole process.  It was emotionally nurturing but her health continued to spiral.  Each visit we got more and more bad news.  Finally, a diagnosis of Stage 4 and she was given only months to live.  We were once again approached by our pastor who asked to come to our home and see us.

During that visit the godless bastard looked straight at her and said she must have some “hidden sin” that was preventing her from being healed and this was Gods way of pushing her to seek the better path blah blah blah.

My wife was sitting there, oxygen tubes up her nose, no hair, down 60lbs from her vibrant pre-cancer self and could barely speak above a whisper.  And he had the gall to accuse her of committing some hidden “sin” stopping God from granting her healing.

I threw him out of our home.  I refuse to worship any God that needs to play with their creation to somehow get off on praise.  That’s bullshit.

She died one of the most wholesome women I’ve ever known and several years later I’d learn that pastor was diddling several kids in the congregation.

If God exists it’s not in any church.  Church was designed to glorify evil men.

**EDIT**

This blew up overnight.  For some follow-up to common questions I’m seeing in the replies to my post….

First, thank you for your support, understanding and even pointing out that one bad pastor (and this man was truly vile) doesn’t condemn an entire religion.  You are right, it doesn’t and shouldn’t.  But I’ve since encountered this in so many other religious settings.  I know the Bible well enough to know there’s literally the opposite support for this belief that “you are being punished for some secret sin.”  Bad people often flourish in this world.  Good people often suffer.  I don’t understand that, other than to understand that good or bad, suffering is the human condition and all faith can offer (often with great effect) is a means to endure it.  

I have been in a few churches since that one, and each of them I felt more and more convinced that its the man/woman behind the pulpit and their character that defines that church.  Which means it’s more of a congregation of charisma and influence than any meaningful expression of worship of God.  Thus….I no longer go to church.  It’s a flawed institution and I’ve found no need to attend any church to maintain a spiritual outlook.  I still ‘tithe’ but now it’s donations to charitable orgs that I research carefully and have a proven track record of actually helping others….and either via coincidence or design, NONE of those orgs are affiliated with any particular religious institution.   

And for those asking.  Not Mormon.  Not Catholic.  Not SDA.  Straight up non-denominational christian church.  One of the larger ones in the region, responsible for spinning off many other versions of the same mega-church.  The pastor disappeared for several years after the incident but later re-appeared at another church.  I don’t blame God for allowing that pastor to continue to live and prosper.  I blame the Church for allowing that….even more proof to me that the institution of Church is the problem.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not to the degree of your story, but this makes me think of my in-laws funeral.


At the time, my husband and I were 26. He has a younger sister and a younger brother, the brother being 15 at the time. Their dad had killed their mom, then himself. It was a massive surprise to the family because there was never any abuse (physical, emotional or otherwise) that was happening in the house. The younger brother never noticed anything, neither did the grandma. To make a long story short, she fell out of love with him and wanted a divorce. He did not.


Their uncle had asked the pastor of the church they attended to speak at the funeral. The family specifically asked that he does not mention the nature of their deaths. To quote my husband, “this was the worst thing he has ever done to them.” 


Like I mentioned, there was no previously noted history of abuse that happened in the household to their mom or them. They already had several mixed emotions about the situation because their dad had always been good to them, yet he is the one who took their mom way. 


The pastor had arrived with an entourage of women from the church, which we did not know would happen. He went on to completely slander their dad, talking about how he was going to hell. Their younger brother was completely overwhelmed and sobbing. 


The man then went to the younger brother, the women laying their hands all over him. My husband was trying to pull him away but they kept grabbing him. He then tells him that he should be grateful his parents even lived this long, because earlier that day, he had to speak at a funeral for a two year old. “At least your parents didn’t die at two years old like this kid did!” 


Like what kind of fucked up comment is that?? I thought my husband was going to swing at him. I grabbed his arm. The entourage of women then spent the remainder of the service passing out flyers to everyone to attend the church. It was some of the most disrespectful shit I’ve ever seen.</div>

They had the information through informant or spyware which they didn't wan't to disclose, so as to hide these capacities, likely illegal ones (we're pre-Snowden reveal, remember).

So they lied about the passport to justify having the informations, without revealing how they actually had it.

Not impossible, and it doesn't require any other 9/11 conspiracy to hold on its own.</div>

Edit: I am not saying this took the building down. It is simply a small piece of evidence in this giant lie we were told from the official story.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Is there any potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement? 

I think this is the major issue with just random mRNA vaccines for everything.

For those of you now aware, antibody-dependent enhancement actually causes the opposite effect and increases the effectiveness of a virus inside your body.

I guess in this situation it would enhance the tumor's rate of replication.</div>

10:03 In your positions of power, did you ever deal with UFO reports?  No…only got some sighting reports.  Didn’t have time to worry about them…had other things to do.

**"It’s crucial that you figure out in advance what you’re going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin."**

It was like a cold shower. I stopped reading and did a quick math.

There are 168 hours in a week. Let’s break down an average, non-holiday week:

* 40 hours for a full-time job
* 56 hours for sleep (am I being generous here?)

That leaves us with 72 hours.

Sure, overplanning can kill the fun, but ‘just existing’ is still a choice about how to spend time. Whether you plan it or not, time gets used—better to be a little thoughtful about it.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/oswaldcopperpot:

---

Last month – the head of NORAD and NORTHCOM – the military commands that defend North America – told Congress some of those mysterious drones seen flying inside the United States may indeed have been spying. He did not say for whom. 60 Minutes has been looking into a series of eerily similar incidents – going back years – including those attention getting [flyovers in New Jerse](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/new-jersey-drones-fbi-department-of-homeland-security/)y recently. In each, drones first appeared over restricted military or civilian sites, coming and going – often literally – "under the radar." The wake-up call came just over a year ago, when drones invaded the skies above Langley Air Force base in Virginia over 17 nights, forcing the relocation of our most advanced fighter jets. Our story starts with an eyewitness and an iPhone.

-Drones are flying with total impunity over the nation most sensitive airspace. Is there anything you can do?

-I really wish we could do something.

-Do you think we will be able to do something in the future?

-Yeah, maybe next year we will have some gizmos that will be able to detect the drones and hopefully bring them down.

-Hopefully?

-Please. Can’t you see how broken I am inside? We’re supposed to be the greatest military on earth and those jokers are parading cheekily under our nose whenever they feel like it, and there’s fuck all we can do.</div>

It tricks me into feeling accomplished without draining me further. Also, sometimes just letting yourself rest without guilt is the most productive thing you can do.</div>

It’s almost like the brain and body being out of sync is a bigger problem than just lack of motivation. Like, we convince ourselves that doing something (even something small) is better than doing nothing, even though sometimes ‘nothing’ might actually be what we need to recharge.

Given clear requirements and solid design (inputs given by the capable intelligent skilled HUMAN) AI can develop production level applications at the user story/module level.

AGI as the human, business analysis, IT lead/designer, product owner, even stakeholder pieces is hit or miss…overall missing.

This requires discovery sessions, research and context windows that we don’t have yet.

A context window of 1 billion tokens with agentic level motivation and function calling skills to all major software product APIs (microsoft, aws, Google cloud) would be the end of all development teams for greenfield work. Legacy would live on slightly longer but would eventually migrate as well.

Like totally gone. We’ll join the ranks of lamplighters.</div>

I don't know how we can come away with such different experiences. My only reasoning is people have 0 idea how to use A.I., even if it seems straight forward.

The other part is people are going to have to come to terms with being dumb. I think every knowledge worker or programmer can understand this innately where you are stretching the limits of your ability to do tasks. But now you're mixing A.I. into it and it's going to be this hassle of what do you know vs what the A.I. knows vs what can you do to bridge the gap. That's going to be an issue tself.</div>

Can you link to a non trivial production level application done with AI? Besides simple code, AI always spit random garbage in my experience  but you seem confident coding is now an automatic task so I will be happy to know more about the tools you or others are using.</div>

Hes saying it because his base of support is predicated on their being a conspiracy against the American people that he is saving them from. Today it’s Biden, tomorrow it’s “illegals” ruining society - he has to fuel the malice, the vitriol, the appall of his supporters. This is the contract. This is the one central truth that the entire house of cards that Trump has bulity is balanced on. Its the, somewhat true, reality - we did have a corrupt system - he’s just warped that reality to mean that the people trying to fix it are actually the problem and need to be removed.</div>

                <div class="post-content">For years, I struggled with waking up early, sticking to workouts, and avoiding distractions. I always had an excuse—“too tired,” “too busy,” “I’ll start tomorrow.” The cycle kept repeating until I decided to change everything.

Here’s how I rewired my mindset and built a structured daily routine that helped me stay disciplined and focused.

1. Stop Relying on Motivation

Motivation is unreliable. The key is treating habits as non-negotiable.

                        <div class="comment-body">It’s funny that you say you no longer rely on willpower, when to me keeping such a schedule requires a ton of willpower.

Willpower is defined as control exerted to do something or restrain impulses. You’re literally applying so much willpower every day to get things done and stick to your routines. I really commend you for it 👏🏼</div>

Like for YEARS I was fighting with willpower to get things done and struggling and failing because it felt like a mountain and I just made little 1% type changes which didn’t feel like they were helping but then one day I just woke up and while I didn’t feel MOTIVATED I didn’t feel like it was a mountain anymore and I just executed…and like a ball rolling down a hill I just kept doing more and then I realized the more I backpedaled the more I saw that mountain appear again so I find it easier to just do it then let it build up knowing the consequences. I joke with my friends it was my prefrontal cortex forming late. But yea it doesn’t even feel like willpower it’s just like “oh a dish is in the sink, I’ll put it in the dishwasher while I’m grabbing water” or “I’ll just run this box I opened downstairs instead of waiting until I open the other 40” and then I do it…</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not a question for me lol. But I’d like to answer.

I adapt my schedule for that week. And my routines are done on a weekly basis. Priorities change but as long as I’m moving towards my targets I’m happy.

I think of my routine as the standard as long as I’m meeting or excelling. I’m happy.

I also have a timeout ticket per week. So if I’m overwhelmed I can chill then get back in the horse.

It’s just about finding what works for you</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">What I got from the "Atomic Habits" book was really that you have to set up your environment in such a way that you reduce and remove the need to rely on willpower in order to do the things you deem important. I was surprised how much visual cues trigger my habits so really being strict about how you use the environment has helped me tremendously. For me these include specific solutions such as:

\* The cellphone is the only device I am allowed to check social media on so it is easier to put it away.

\* Put the alarm clock next to the door so I have to get out of bed to get to it

\* Putting my cellphone besides the alarm clock so I don't grab it an doom scroll in bed when going to bed, or when waking up before the alarm

\* Charge my cellphone in the kitchen away from my computer so I don't by automatic habit grab for it every time I start getting bored, and I have set it to "don't disturb"-mode during the mornings so no one can actually disturb me.

\* Having the phone in the kitchen also means that if I want to check messages I have to go to the kitchen to read 'em. I only bring the phone over to the computer if I actually have to use it as an authenticator.

\* Do the most important stuff the first time in the morning (to me it is reading to learn something every day)

\* Have a set "go to bed" time where I dim the lights in the apartment about an hour before so I'm nice and tired when the time comes

\* I have a wide table with a laptop connected to a big monitor, when I read and learn I use the big monitor, but when I want to do the entertainment stuff I actually scooch over to the laptop screen so I kind of create the "one space, one use" where I get to be most comfortable when I do the most important things to me (reading and learning). I don't have a big enough apartment that I can section off different rooms for different activities, but this works great!

  
Like all these things have turned into habits for me at this point so I don't have to go around remembering all the rules, they just are a part of my daily habits. I went from forcing myself to read a couple of hours a week to now at least 12 hours, last week I read and learned about 17 hours, and this without feeling I am forcing myself in any way. It would be cool to reach 20 hours as it would mean for every 2 years of 40 hour work week, I've also had 1 year of reading and learning!</div>

It's like when you teach a kid math for the first time and they just start giving answers to earlier problems. 
You say if 1+1=2 and 2+2=4 then what is 3+3?
And the kid shouts! 4! No, 2!</div>
