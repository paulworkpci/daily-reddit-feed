&gt;LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">id be excited to be proven wrong on this but it seems like “Solving a Million-Step LLM Task with Zero Errors” is more like "Solving a deterministic puzzle with a trivial recursive algorithm and a known optimal sequence that can be coded in 20 lines of python". that headline is doing a ton of work and they have essentially created the most expensive tower of hanoi algorithm - this is nowhere near “a million step arbitrary reasoning chain” and i have serious doubts as to this having any ability to scale to even the simplest open ended problems. this seems okay for problems with a known solution and algorithm but then at that point might as well just code it.

also that graph is textbook misleading data representation. they are comparing general models to an orchestration of millions of calls to a small model. the rightmost point is a single successful run with a lot of special machinery and hand made choices. its like plotting single violinists on the left then putting an entire orchestra with a conductor and post production editing on the right and calling that a fair comparison of musicians. if the authors are willing to do that id be incredibly skeptical of the rest of the content of this paper.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I believe they only picked tower of Hanoi because it was the problem Apple used in their paper to show that LLMs couldn't efficiently solve long time horizon tasks.

This is probably the best paragraph in the paper describing what they're actually doing:

&gt; In a long-horizon agentic task with s steps, the goal of an LLM-based system is to produce a sequence of actions
a1, . . . , as that yields a target output y given the initial input x [11]. This paper is concerned with the following question:
How does the decomposition of the task into subtasks affect its solvability?
&gt; The s-step task can be decomposed into subtasks, with the granularity of the decomposition defined by the number of
steps m per subtask. Subtasks can then be solved by separate calls to LLM agents, where a templating function ϕ maps
the input and specification of a subtask to a prompt for an LLM M , an extractor ψa parses actions from the LLM’s
output response r, and a second extractor ψx parses information from r to include in the input to the next subtask. Let
x0 = x. A solution to the full task can then be sampled recursively:...

They go through how they decompose these tasks and then introduce a notion of first to ahead by k voting (classify solutions, the first one that gets more than k votes ahead of the others wins).  They then show how many votes ahead you need (k) for different levels of underlying reliability (how likely is the LLM to answer correctly) and different time horizons (how many steps) to basically have a probability ~1 of arriving at the correct overall solution.

They take pains throughout to describe how most of the steps in here can be made generic.

I actually think it's a pretty interesting paper and can see how other tasks might be decomposed in this manner.  You'd probably want to have some sort of model to determine k for the sub tasks if you wanted this to be an expedient solution though. Maybe not though, it could be that most subtasks are executed with extremely high reliability and you just need a low k to ensure cascading failures don't occur on the off chance you make a mistake.

Edit: That first graph is crap though.  The later ones are more interesting.</div>

Im curious what you mean by the book disagreeing with the statement “your thoughts and feelings are not you”? it’s accurate to call this a Buddhist teaching. These are each one of what are called the five aggregates, into which any beings experience can be decomposed, and yet the finding is that none of these are in fact the “self”. It’s a teaching about anatta.</div>

There is no essential unchanging self

What I thought the book said is that while subjective experience is a collection of said things which are in flux, you cannot detach and observe said things as if they were separate from you, mind cannot push away mind.

The idea of oneness of mind also leads cleanly into the topic of interdependence and inter-being — that all phenomena are of one reality and that nothing can separate itself from everything else</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think they only show the best runs in these videos. Like they may do 10 runs, and 9 of the runs fail, but the 1 run that succeeds, they put that in the video.

The video said there was no teleoperating, but that doesn't mean the tasks weren't preprogrammed.  Preprogrammed may not be good enough though, because that means the robot is not able to adjust to different environments and changing conditions. It can only do the task in the environment and conditions that the code was written for. 

What will truly make these humanoid robots useful is when they are able to intelligently adjust to a new environment and new conditions.  At the very end of the video, they show a more authentic adjustment to a new condition, when a person picks up the doll with a stick, and moves it around in the air.  That's what we need to see in the entire video, how the robot can adjust to unexpected conditions and a totally new environment.  

My understanding as to why these robots can't adjust to all these different environments and adjust to variable conditions is that there isn't enough data yet, to train them on it.

Having said that, I think with how fast AI is improving, and the increase in data that is being used to train them, it's just a matter of time until they can do all the different tasks in a home. I have said myself that of the remaining tasks in factories that humans do, probably 20% of these those tasks are very repetitive and very simple tasks, and within the next 5 to 10 years, these humanoid robots will probably be replacing the people that do these tasks in factories (some car manufacturers such as BMW, BYD, Zeekr, etc, are already using these humanoid robots).</div>

\&gt; One of SIMA 2’s most exciting new capabilities is its capacity for self-improvement. We’ve observed that, throughout the course of training, SIMA 2 agents can perform increasingly complex and new tasks, bootstrapped by trial-and-error and Gemini-based feedback.

\&gt; For example, after initially learning from human demonstrations, **SIMA 2 can transition to learning in new games exclusively through self-directed play, developing its skills in previously unseen worlds without additional human-generated data.** In subsequent training, SIMA 2’s own experience data can then be used to train the next, even more capable version of the agent. We were even able to leverage SIMA 2’s capacity for self-improvement in newly created Genie environments – a major milestone toward training general agents across diverse, generated worlds.

This is essentially the beginning of the singularity. They're using Genie 3 to create worlds and SIMA 2 to recursively self-improve in that world.</div>

So when you start your degree, pick a fairly broad topic related to your major that you're especially interested in, and aim as many of your papers toward that topic- for any class, not just in your major classes- as you can. Keep a file (say, a searchable word document) of all the research, book quotations, stat...</div>

Most of the time the "research" you do for classes is not really that important to the instructor beyond showing them what YOU have learned about doing research. Using your old notes might be a quick shortcut, and if you're willing to update and refine and improve, that's good, but if not, then you have just learned less in your class.. students sometimes forget that college is not like high school and despite any family pressure they may feel, there's no law that says they have to go to college and learn how to learn, or learn about things beyond what they got out of their state curriculum in high school.

I could go on, but I suspect most students are not really interested in anything but shortcuts. As one of my colleagues often said, students are the only consumers that want less for their money…</div>

Oh boy isn't that true, it always frustrated me about my classmates, always trying to evade going to classes. Through all of undergrad, I believe I only missed half of one lecture, because I got notification that my grandfather was "actively dying" in the middle of it and booked it out of there. Was otherwise back in class the following day. Full time tuition (12-16 credit range) came out to over $100/hr of classroom seat time at 16 credits (meaning $130/hr at 12), and you're telling me you're gonna skip? I'm not skipping something that costs more per hour than I hope to earn at my career!</div>

Nor even a portion of the same paper. Learned this one the hard way. Got put on academic probation for something called “self-plagiarism.” Wasn’t aware I could steal my own unpublished work, but the assistant dean was *pissed*. You would have thought I’d stolen her daughter’s virtue. 

Got called into her office and informed that they “didn’t graduate cheaters.” Had zero marks on my record up until then. Didn’t know I couldn’t reuse applicable portions for very similar assignments.
Thought I was just being efficient. 

Anyway, good LPT. Do this, not what I did lol.</div>

Even if you are using your own work, cite it in the future with the class and date of the assignment—it can’t be called plagiarism then just a quote with improvements using your surrounding ideas.

&gt;If we colonize Mars, there could be too many people there, which would be a serious pressing issue. But there's no point working on it right now, and that's why I can’t productively work on not turning AI evil.

                        <div class="comment-body">Your foot position when receiving should be the same distance as your foot position when you squat. The only “fault” I see with how you received is how angled your feet are. 

The main “fault” I noticed with your clean is that you aren’t fully extending your hips - it’s like you’re jumping your feet out but not jumping up. Does that make sense? Squeeze your butt when you go to jump and that will help you open your hips more and get more power.</div>

For reference, that is DOUBLE $NVDA market cap. Tesla needs to grow 6-7x their current size for this to occur which is an impossibly huge milestone.

He hasn't been paid a trillion dollars unless all you read are just headlines and nothing more.</div>
