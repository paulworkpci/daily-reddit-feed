When a user requests a photoshop professional for an edit they don't get any manual control either, the professional does. They can ask for revisions but it might cost them more, but with AI now they can do more and more revisions and point out exact details to change. The main limitation is resolution, which is pretty low still.</div>

A higher level of abstraction isn't the issue, the issue is whether you can achieve the output you want.

Which in this case, is there anything you do in Photoshop that can't be expressed fairly easily with language?


And I assume that very soon you'll also be able to select the exact pixels or area you want to change and use a prompt to change them.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I always have to think of the case "dog pooped on the floor, then the vacuum bot came and now we have a brown floor" and wonder what all could go wrong in each such step. Rocks, keys, money bag, or whatever in one of those pockets? Maybe a cat snuck into the clothing box? That all happens to humans, too, but there is at least a chance of stopping and wondering "where's the baby cat?" - Where this machine would probably just take the cloths out and put a dead cat body into the drier just to fold it into shape in the end.

Not that I wouldn't want such a bot taking care of chores, but as you point out: there is much more involved, even when not counting in the plethora of things that could possibly go wrong.</div>

Text that word to your friends before they arrive. Late people just tell the host the word and they find the table quick. Way fewer “sorry what name?” moments, and no spelling games. Tried it 3 times now and it’s kinda magic lol.</div>

Now i have proved it, whilst they may be looking for more than this, i have whittled it down to something pretty simple. Markers, they are heavily weightig their scoring on markers (specific types of characters that AI's tend to produced).

Some of the most common markers I’ve found AI outputs sprinkle in:

I've been accused several times of being a bot or using an LLM to generate content simply because I usually write in fairly standard English and sometimes use semi-colons. I've recently re-written my CV to be more informal for exactly this reason - one interviewer told me directly that they weren't impressed I used ChatGPT to write my application, despite the fact that said application was an updated version of a template from *2019*. 


It's not at all surprising to me that you've found these tools simply look for specific characters in specific locations. I don't know how you approached it, but it would be a pretty cool project to take a piece of text and randomly add in ascii characters to see if all it takes is literally the presence of certain characters in any context. Presumably you have to pay by volume of text though, is it prohibitive to have a python script smash through every combination of characters?</div>

Our mind is like a toddler and this kind of strictness pushes it further away for the main goal. It is important to BE LOVING to yourself while meditating... It needs to be seamless..

                                <div class="reply-body">What I never understand is with motorcycles and manual cars enthusiasists, why not just... teach people?

I have met 15 people this year irl who get surprised then go on a "Kids these days" talk when I say I can't drive manual and have never ridden a motorcycle. Yk, the sticks are dying, motorcycles are declining... But when I ask my uncles how they started in the 80s-

1. People taught them and let them use beater cars and bikes to learn; most landowners would happily let folk derp around on their farms for spare change or labor
2. Bikes and cars were cheap, and they had shop class so even if they had a $150 dualsport that barely ran, they fixed it up. My uncles went through dirt-cheap dirt bikes their whole life.

Like I was looking at a car that was like, a Chevy version of  a Honda Fit, for $9k, basically new. Six salesmen said no ones been interested in it- because it was a manual, and then I admitted I also couldn't drive stick, but if someone could teach me, I'd buy it. No decide. No one there knew or was willing. It made me wonder if a dealership sells sticks, why not have a class or two? Especially if you have inventory you can't sell, simply because the market for it doesn't know how to drive stick</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Manuals for however long I can still operate one for me. Daily my GTI in heavy traffic and hills everyday.

Honestly though, it’s hard to recommend a manual with how much traffic there is. On top of automatics being much better now in general, more efficient and faster. 

Obviously, less manuals being offered also lower sales numbers but most people purchase a vehicle for utility, convenience, and commmute. Automatics just make it easier. Manuals have become more of a weekend car to a lot of people who still want one.</div>

It's great, but it's hardly a solution for most people. Having 2 cars is expensive and unnecessary, probably doesn't make sense for like 95% of people.</div>

Both years had been horribly stressful at work and I needed a break, but with the pandemic, any serious travel was out. Both times I did it, I had a loose plan of what I wanted to do during my time off and when the weather was good for something on the list, I'd do it. There were a few day trips to other areas of my state and some stops at local parks and nature preserves that were outside my normal routine. A little bit of retail therapy at an outlet mall near me. I also had a large Lego set that I'd work on over the entire vacation.

There was no rush to do anything and there were no early mornings. Lots of staying in bed late and waking up without an alarm. I wouldn't want every vacation to be a staycation, but both times I've done it they were very enjoyable. It helps that I don't have kids!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Reminds me of this yt video where a guy was explaining his world travel strategy where he waits for there to be some sort of international tragedy. A tsunami, a terrorist attack, etc and then goes there in the next month or two. He said the county is desperate for tourism that has dried up, so everything is cheap, the flights are as low-cost as they will ever be, and it tends to have heightened security so it's safer than usual.


Always stuck me as a bit ghoulish, though.</div>

But we booked out flights (for months later) that week. We got 2 round trip flights in the upgraded section (free drinks) for $780.

Editing early morning brain: Volcano eruption*. Though I’m sure if there was a tornado eruption you’d see similar price drops.</div>

That aside - it's sad that society needs this, but I also think it's going to become common, especially in technologically advanced countries.

The thing is, it expects **TOML config** as opposed to the standard **JSON** that we’ve gotten used to, and it might seem confusing.

No worries — it’s very similar. I’ll show you how to quickly convert it, and share some nuances on the Codex implementation.
