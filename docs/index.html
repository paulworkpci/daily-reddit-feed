I'm from Asia and $20 isn't cheap, but if we pressure the wrong people it will get nowhere. We need to take the load off and understand collective opinion is immensely valuable to change the course of a tech. We need people to stop milking controversy so the tech can advance.</div>

I have always done these things. It's more than 90% of the general population will ever do. And after a year I could run a mile, never done that before. No injuries, feel better, lost weight.

                        <div class="comment-body">Late 40s crossfitter here. The «injuries» I have had over the years are more of the kind where doing one specific thing or one group of very CrossFit related things hurt so I don’t do them for a while and the injuries go away after a few months. They rarely spill over into my regular life. 

And honestly, compared to my peers at work, having an inflamed biceps tendon for a couple of months or whatever is peanuts compared to the health issues they have. 

It’s not like you are likely to break something or suffer a major injury in any way. Most are overuse injuries, and as the name suggests, you don’t overuse something by only doing it once. There is going to be plenty of warning signs that you have to ignore before you get them. </div>

I'll be 44 in a few days, and currently have a little bit of tendonitis in my knee because I wore my CrossFit shoes to Hyrox class and learned the hard way that I can't run miles and miles in shoes like that anymore. So I'm using my current inability to run as a chance to improve my ski erg times. I'm sure I'll run again before long (in my running shoes this time). It's not the end of the world. This is one of the few injuries I've had and they all go about like this. 


I completely agree that I'd rather have this than what the sedentary people i see around the office have going on. Middle age and older office workers are a mess. I'm glad my only problem is that I can't run for a few weeks. I'll take CrossFit any day. </div>

I staunchly refuse to do kipping pull-ups and anything else I might find problematic. My gym’s coaches are all amazing and understanding, and the programming is sensible.</div>

Yes, both 4 and 5 models are being routed to TWO secret backend models if it judges anything is remotely sensitive or emotional, or illegal.

OpenAI has paid tiers to be able to use 40. People are saying because 40 is generating responses that 5 would generate instead of 40 that they're not being given what they're paying for

OP is describing something as “fraudulent” when it is simply a change that the company made to its products.  There is no requirement that OpenAI explain the change, give insight into its models or anything of that nature.

OpenAI operates in a free market where, if you don’t like their products or changes to said products, you can cancel the service and use a different service.  Same thing if you don’t like their level of transparency or their communications.

This is the equivalent of declaring that a TV network is fraudulent because they replaced an actor on a show or made other programming changes.  Most people are just entitled idiots who don’t understand wtf they’re talking about.</div>

It's a "space race" between OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google and the leader tripped over their own feet. That's not a scandal, it's a competitive disadvantage. Gemini and Claude now have a chance to attack. Gemini is my go-to for now. Claude is fantastic, amazing at coding, but Gemini just has a more complete package for my personal tastes.
Don't write off OpenAI yet though. They've got some crazy powerful tech, it's just held back by the reality of available hardware and power requirements. They need to find ways to trim the requirements of their models or build out their data centers dramatically. AI is hitting a wall where the hardware can't keep up with the software, so something big needs to happen or the bubble will burst on all of them.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Its so comical because that dude is exactly right. In 2016 Republicans didnt want anything to do with Trump because he was so divisive. So many of them were 'never Trumpers'. Thats why in 2024 his cabinet makeup was completely different. All sycophants and no one to push back. People whos careers hinge on bending the knee. Greatest example is none other than JD Vance. Peter Thiel saw he could cash in on his personal investment so Vance changed his tune.

Best description of Trump was from Vance himself:

"What Trump offers is an easy escape from the pain. To every complex problem, he promises a simple solution. He never offers details for how these plans will work, because he can’t. Trump’s promises are the needle in America’s collective vein. Trump is cultural heroin. He makes some feel better for a bit but he cannot fix what ails them, and one day they’ll realize it."</div>

Republican activist Parker J. Bena pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography on his home computer and was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison and fined $18,000.

Republican parole board officer and former Colorado state representative, Larry Jack Schwarz, was fired after child pornography was found in his possession.

Republican strategist and Citadel Military College graduate Robin Vanderwall was convicted in Virginia on five counts of soliciting sex from boys and girls over the internet.

Republican city councilman Mark Harris, who is described as a “good military man” and “church goer,” was convicted of repeatedly having sex with an 11-year-old girl and sentenced to 12 years in prison.

Republican businessman Jon Grunseth withdrew his candidacy for Minnesota governor after allegations surfaced that he went swimming in the nude with four underage girls, including his daughter.

Republican director of the “Young Republican Federation” Nicholas Elizondo molested his 6-year old daughter and was sentenced to six years in prison.

Republican benefactor of conservative Christian groups, Richard A. Dasen Sr., was charged with rape for allegedly paying a 15-year old girl for sex.  Dasen, 62, who is married with grown children and several grandchildren, has allegedly told police that over the past decade he paid more than $1 million to have sex with a large number of young women.

Dennis Hastert served as Republican Speaker of the House (so, 3rd in line for the Presidency) for all 8 years of W. Bush’s two terms. He also sexually molested at least 5 boys when he was a HS wrestling coach, all of them underage with the youngest victim being 14. The victims only finally saw justice when Hastert was caught by the FBI trying to falsify payments for hush money.

Donald Trump walked into Miss Teen USA change rooms with girls as young as 14 changing. 26 women have spoken publicly about Trump’s pattern of sexual assault. In 2023, he was found legally liable for the sexual assault of E. Jean Carroll by unanimous jury.

He is the embodiment of everything rotten in American politics, crammed into an ill-fitting suit. He carries the sleaze of a conman, the cowardice of a draft dodger, the greed of a parasite, and the prejudice of a Klansman. He has the sexism of a back-alley creep and the ignorance of a drunk at the bar, all wrapped in a spray-painted orange façade paraded like a prize hog at a county fair. He is not a president, not even a man, but the diseased distillation of arrogance, stupidity, cruelty, greed, and corruption masquerading as ambition and strength. He turns America’s shadow side into a spectacle, worshipped by those who kneel before money, power, and spite. He proves that when a nation values those things above all else, it doesn’t just lose its soul, it produces this bloated obscenity and dares to call it a leader.</div>

Well. I guess they have all that money they saved by cutting park rangers and veterans support. They can use that instead

They do this a few times and record it themselves so Trump can brag about how he's saving the city with a huge show of force. The reality? I've never even seen anything like this. I think I've seen 1 DHS vehicle that may have been ICE and it was just driving by. I know ICE have detained probably a few hundred illegal immigrants around the city but relatively speaking, Chicago is enormous, has millions of people and 1/3 are latino. This is NOT what an average day looks like for majority of people. Its a spectacle. A show to try and intimidate and make a photo op for Trump.</div>
