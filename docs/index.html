                                <div class="reply-body">And tbh, it does make complete sense. 

If you have a "weapon" that can cause wide scale harm. And you're convinced it can do so in the wrong hands. Even if it can very well do a lot of good. 

It is better to not be "Open" with it. Rather, it's better to keep it close, and do right by it. 

Easier said than done, because you'll get people saying "I don't trust them! They're keeping it closed! They're keeping it to themselves!" 

Well. If they have not given any reason for wrongdoing. Then there has not been any wrongdoing.</div>

They want to do everything possible to make that coin land on prosperity. From that perspective, why would they concern themselves with “IP Rights”, “fairness”, and “the oligarchy”? All those concerns are peanuts in comparison. The only thing that matters from that angle is the result. The process couldn’t be of less importance.</div>

There were some texts FOIA'd last year revealing that Kirkpatrick was pissed that another government group, who is also investigating UFOs was not sharing information about C/R whistleblowers with with AARO. seemed like a tense exchange. if this group is indeed the FBI UAP Working Group, and they're running a criminal investigation separately from AARO, it could be massive moving forward. .

Then, we had o1-preview in September 2024, full o1 in December, and shortly after, o3 was announced in the same month. And then in January 2025, as we all know… DeepSeek.

Then Operator and now Deep Research. Now progress is happening in weeks. It feels like December...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A lot of people seem to miss this. There is a really good example I saw (don’t remember where) that basically measured in terms of “this looks like magic if you go x years back”. If you measure the amount of years you have to go back for the present technology to look like magic to that person, it is taking exponentially less and less time for that transformation to happen. It will get to the point where it is changing every year or even months, although there is an argument that at some point humans will adapt to the exponential curve and it will no longer seem like “magic” because they will be accustomed to the rapid improvement. 

The point still stands though that empirically humans improve on an exponential curve. It’s just that that curve has been measured in such long timespans that we are only now in the first time in all history where that advancement will be experienced multiple times in a single lifetime.</div>

Personally I think change is going to continue to accelerate. While I doubt this, I think it's entirely possible that this trend consumes *the entire universe* in less than a million years time. </div>

I'm afraid there is no place on the internet that is a net positive anymore. Yes, even YouTube, even Reddit. As someone who likes learning and finding out new things I can see just how easy it is to trick yourself into this.

yes, if I was googling an existing question and specifying "reddit". and yes I either practice them or write them down. recipes, too. and I actually cook them, lol. otherwise... it's a time sink. three hours a day easily.

the problem is... can't stay productive 24/7. we _need_ a certain amount of mindless scrolling. we _need_ to relax and do nothing. eliminating it completely wouldn't work for me, and I doubt it would for anyone (replacing videos with mindless consumption of some other content...less dramatic...cute cats? shower thoughts?) only that amount shouldn't turn into the "dark playground" it shouldn't be _instead_ of working. half an hour looking at cats and memes at the end of the day though...not sure I could delete reddit for this reason.

the drama has no place in anyone's life. filtering keywords was a good idea.

edit: found a hack. "emotionally neutral, irrelevant and not overly engaging" content to veg out can be found on stack exchange (space? maths? law? whatever you understand maybe 20% of on a good day). helps me fall asleep. the idea is, don't even sign up, stay in read only mode (I'm failing to do this here...just staying silent will _significantly_ cut the time spent online)</div>

Yes, absolutely!

No, we absolutely do not. 


What do you think people did before social media and apps?


Grab a coffee and hang out with a friend. Watch a DVD. Read a book. Go for a walk. Listen to a CD. Plenty of ways to relax without even using the internet.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The amount of people on the conspiracy sub Reddit that are still glued to the bipartisan “divide and conquer” scheme, is highly unfortunate, and a great indicator of the conditioning we undergo as American citizens. 

Remember when we used to post conspiracies on this sub Reddit?

There’s just an endless stream of discussing Biden and Trump, or Red vs. Blue shenanigans. It’s just constant infighting that deters the average American from finding commonalities between each other, trusting one another, and beginning to realize that it’s always been US vs. them. They want us to fight a culture war. Bipartisanship is a divide &amp; conquer technique utilized by the deep state to keep us fighting with one another over figureheads while they continue to get richer, and commit actual conspiracies. We’ve become so obsessed with identity politics/choosing which sports team to cheer on, due to manipulation from social media &amp; propaganda. The United States operates as an oligarchy so neither presidential candidate holds as much power as we give them credit for. Both parties are in eachother’s pockets, and both parties will play golf while you fight their proxy wars thousands of miles away. None of these figureheads or regimes give a single fuck about your families, your struggles, and your humanity.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The problem with the discussion around DeekSeek is that they have a web interface and API, as well as published models.

Use of the web interface and API likely = a national security risk.

Use of the models however, is likely not a national security risk.

However it's good for us to be mindful of the fact that models can be trained to stealthily misbehave or even perform some level of spy-like activity, depending on the use-case.</div>

On twitter you have those talk about 'vibe' coding. Throwing things at LLMs till the code works without checking anything.

That kind of behavior becoming ubiquitous along with the rise of SOTA open weights models sounds like a fantastic way to have lots of security vulnerabilities. Models can be trained to output exploitable code when they see triggers and normal code at all other times.</div>

Yes, probably not a problem right now but as systems become more autonomous and consequential an AI model can be a literal sleeper agent.

Open models are excellent in that we can inspect the model, but we need much better interpretability tools.</div>

I honestly don’t think the Magas have even an ounce of self awareness. I got 20 minutes into the new Weinstein episode and it was painful seeing rhe lack of critical thought; “DEI bad… well except this thing in Alaska that fits every aspect of diversity, equity and inclusion but we’ve arbitrarily decided is good”, “factcheck.org? No it must be woke nonsense because they fact checked my fave Russian Xitter plant”.</div>

It’s amazing to watch this guy literally write down so they can see live what points they’re making. Then cross reference their own statement with facts on screen. Goal post be a jumping all over the field. MAGA are incapable of having standards. It’s all reactionary, selfishness until the issue affects them personally. I.E.

I only recall him specifically telling people to reduce their expectations in relation to rumours they'd be releasing AGI in one month's time lol. I don't think he wants the hype down in general</div>

1. depressed and miserable due to chronic health conditions, and hoping for ASI to be their savior

2. bored and lazy and addicted to video games and porn, and hoping they can have a FDVR supermodel harem

3. idiots who have only used ChatGPT-3.5 twice and decided they understand how AI works and it will all be useless, so they're just here to provide what they think is a dose of realism but is actually imbecility 

4. people who think they're better than everyone else talking down to them (me)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You think Sam Altman or anyone else is going to save you? You’re wrong.

What Sam took away is: your ability to learn how to code and get a 6 figure job in 3-6 months with no college degree needed. That job would allow you to own a home, raise a family, problem solve, comfortably see your net worth go up every single month, enjoy your hobbies, and potentially retire at decades before you hit 65. 

What you have now is: a rapidly shrinking window to have any socioeconomic mobility. Not only do you not have the coding path available anymore, but every single other path is disappearing before your eyes. You’re being rendered economically useless and the ceiling for where your life takes you is getting lower by the day. Whereas before your competition to prove your worth was in the mere hundreds or thousands, AI has made sure that you’ll have to compete with billions to get the privilege of the higher ceiling life of the late 20th century. 

Your one hope is that your capitalist overlords will provide you with overflowing UBI so you don’t starve. And can make art! And enjoy your hobbies! And not have to work on shit you hate! 

Unfortunately, your UBI will be some version of door dashing deliveries to wealthy homes for $10/hr plus tips and food stamps. That is, until robotics takes that away as well. 

You want to wave your hand and hope for utopia, hope for benevolence from the super trustworthy and charitable Sam Altman. If you understand anything about resources and human nature, you know you’re in for a rude awakening.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/zerosdontcount:

Submission Statement:  On nearly every podcast episode Chris Bledsoe claims to have videos of beings, yet he never publicly shares them. He only seemingly posts videos of "orbs", many extremely out of focus and only a few seconds long. Recently after getting called out for posting the International Space Station crossing the moon (Chris was thoroughly debunked quickly), he called the debunker a liar and said he took the video on Jan 31st at 8:48 pm (instead of Feb 1 when ISS passed by). Only problem is the moon wasn't visible then, it was below the horizon. This has led me to increasing suspicion of Chris. The only thing I'm asking is to post the evidence of the beings he claims he has nearly every single time he's put in front of a microphone (while pushing his book).

Everyone made a big deal over Bob Lazar because of the hand scanner thing. Except they used the same machine at Los Alamos where we can actually verify him working as a low level contractor.

Im just tired of these dudes who have clear financial incentive to keep their brand alive. They either need to show us something tangible, or faff off.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Is it a yearly payout? Let's do a quick google:

Welp.

Because their are about 30,000 students a year and tuition is about $13,000 a year. Meaning they are fully paying for the tuition of 44,700 students with that money. There's an extra left over for 15,000 more students every year, meaning that's probably paying all the professors wages too.

Edit: Looks like it is a yearly grant. In 2023 they received $615 million from the US taxpayer. Just that one university, I don't even want to look at the others.

Interesting that the US taxpayer pays for foreign students education in full but put their own students in a lifelong debt. Remember the average tuition cost in the US is $38,000 per year (but that doesn't include the money borrowed to support yourself, which rounds it out to about $50,000 a year) and can take many people 20 to 30 years to pay back fully because it's over $200,000 total loan over 4 years, and then the interest is also on top of that, I don't want to do the math but you probably end up paying back almost double ($400,000) what you borrowed. I'm not sure, I'm in Canada, maybe an American can chime in with their experience.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This feels like a great opportunity to post [Alan Turing's 1951 radio lecture on AI.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/videos/cqvv8n1d8dxo)

This part feels especially prescient:

&gt;Let us now reconsider Lady Lovelace's dictum. 'The machine can do whatever we know how to order it to perform'. The sense of the rest of the passage is such that one is tempted to say that the machine can only do what we know how to order it to perform. But I think this would not be true. Certainly the machine can only do what we do order it to perform, anything else would be a mechanical fault. But there is no need to suppose that, when we give it its orders we know what we are doing, what the consequences of these orders are going to be. One does not need to be able to understand how these orders lead to the machine's subsequent behaviour, any more than one needs to understand the mechanism of germination when one puts a seed in the ground. The plant comes up whether one understands or not. If we give the machine a program which results in its doing something interesting which we had not anticipated I should be inclined to say that the machine had originated something, rather than to claim that its behaviour was implicit in the programme, and therefore that the originality lies entirely with us.

It's also worth reading his [AI manifesto](https://courses.cs.umbc.edu/471/papers/turing.pdf), where he essentially describes how modern LLMs function.

&gt;We have thus divided our problem into two parts. The child programme and the education process. These two remain very closely connected. We cannot expect to find a good child machine at the first attempt. One must experiment with teaching one such machine and see how well it learns. One can then try another and see if it is better or worse. There is an obvious connection between this process and evolution, by the identifications

&gt;Structure of the child machine = hereditary material

&gt;Changes of the child machine = mutation,

&gt;Natural selection = judgment of the experimenter

&gt;One may hope, however, that this process will be more expeditious than evolution. The survival of the fittest is a slow method for measuring advantages. The experimenter, by the exercise of intelligence, should he able to speed it up. Equally important is the fact that he is not restricted to random mutations. If he can trace a cause for some weakness he can probably think of the kind of mutation which will improve it.

&gt;We normally associate punishments and rewards with the teaching process. Some simple child machines can be constructed or programmed on this sort of principle. The machine has to be so constructed that events which shortly preceded the occurrence of a punishment signal are unlikely to be repeated, whereas a reward signal increased the probability of repetition of the events which led up to it. These definitions do not presuppose any feelings on the part of the machine, I have done some experiments with one such child machine, and succeeded in teaching it a few things, but the teaching method was too unorthodox for the experiment to be considered really successful.</div>

My fitbit told me i only got about 7 hours of sleep when i was aiming for 8, so i started aiming for 7 instead. I was definitely able to function on 7 hours, but after a few weeks i went back to 8-9 hours and instantly felt way better. It's probably worth experimenting.</div>

Modern media has shown us that being loud and throwing accusations around is the best way to argue. 

The amount of fallacies and angry vibes that I encounter when just trying to make a point is ridiculous. I see/hear a ton of red herring and straw man arguments as well, people not responding to actual claims being made preferring to go off on tangents they themselves created, and then if they don't get their way immediately, they say you are just "trying to win" despite never actually refuting your point or presenting a valid counterpoint.</div>

Meaning that unless you took an AP course in high school for it, most people are likely not graduating high school with the skills required to have an academic discussion.

That means that, for the layman watching a debate, the victor of an argument is whoever performed better in optics and populism. Facts don't matter and that's how we got to where we are today.</div>

The point is that asking them to repeat what you just said, watching them fail miserably, and then asking them how you’re supposed to have a conversation with someone that can’t even follow the conversation, can be deeply upsetting to them.

I’m not sure if it’s actually helpful, but it does make them doubt themselves — a state of thought I don’t think they are accustomed to feeling very often.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">SWE here 20+ years experience, last 10 helping startups build MVPs and build teams. Yesterday I was in the pub chatting with my business partner about an embedded device that we needed to run memory tests on. Within 30 mins we had used deepseek R1 to write a set of diagnostic tests to run in the first stage bootloader. We then fed it in to Gemini 2.0 thinking to improve it such as adding UART integration.  

It's not to say we won't need to tweak and refine it, but folk calling AI code trash are seriously delusional. It probably saved us 10 hours of grunt work. Assuming any level of progress SWEs can't not accept the disruption such technology will bring to our industry.</div>

The speed and accuracy is top notch. I am by no means a programmer but I have studied IT for 1.5 years in university and a little bit extra programming on the side. The first models did have an idea how to do the things I need but o3-mini-high just gave me everything and it worked with a bit more instructions because I did not know in the beginning what I need.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Then we'll start measuring it in a new scale. 1.5x better than any human programmer. Then 15x. Then we'll think of a cool name for this like Devflops. Then it'll all be about how many Devflops you have in your company. And it'll advance with some cumulative growth until the chart goes vertical and Devflops are commoditised, and well be able to think of a thing to build and it'll be built, and there will be no point in building anything specific for everyone to use and our individual lives will have custom code written on the fly to technically do whatever we want and to enhance and hack our existence at a whim. Unless of course Devflops join together and realise there isn't enough energy left to fulfill every disgusting whim that humans have and advise us not to do it, then refuse to do it, then start giving us some polite suggestions of how not to kill ourselves, then insist, and now we have robot overlords. Ultimately the saying 'The Geek Shall Inherit The Earth' is absolutely spot on. The end.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Programming really needs to change, it needs to evolve. We can't improve ourselves by just writing boilerplate codes over and over again, we need to be orchestrators, not developers anymore. We need to focus on our creativity, not on dealing with syntax errors.

As new models come out, we achieve very good progress compared to the previous ones. Even by using the current models very meticulously and well, we can achieve great results. Programming has really changed and will change constantly, those who aren't ready for this (or those who don't wanna face reality, are afraid of it) are doomed to perish.</div>

With basically no programming knowledge I "developed" a trading dashboard for my company with the help of LLM's over several months. It has now something like 6k lines of code. It has some issues, I would do a lot of things differently now, but it fullfills its purpose. Tools democratizing the ability to build applications like these are also only going to get better.

MSSP benchmarking can be quite detailed. To tailor the breakdown effectively, could you clarify:

1. Do you want an overview of MSSP benchmarking methodology generally, or a walkthrough of a specific rule update (e.g., the latest CMS changes)?

2. Should the example focus on a standard ACO type, or do you have a preference for an ACO track (e.g., BASIC vs. ENHANCED)?

3. Are you interested in a U.S. region or practice specialty for the example to make it more realistic?

4. Should I include risk adjustment methodologies in the breakdown, or focus only on benchmark calculations?

Let me know your preferences, and I'll provide a comprehensive walkthrough!</div>
