A true AGI with unlimited compute would probably get 100% on all the benches, but in terms of real world impacts it may not even matter. The o3 models will replace white collar human jobs on a massive scale. The singularity is approaching.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">The real question is how long have they had this chilling at the lab? And what's next? I think OAI has been sitting on a stack of models. Some of which they continue to refine while waiting for their competition to release something similar to stir hype, if everything just continued to come from them it would lessen the shock and awe. Then OAI drops a similar model to the competitors release or better. Similar to the K Dot Drake beef we had back in the spring. Not saying this is what is happening but I really don't think it's to far off.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">Furthermore, early data points suggest that the upcoming ARC-AGI-2 benchmark will still pose a significant challenge to o3, potentially reducing its score to under 30% even at high compute (while a smart human would still be able to score over 95% with no training). This demonstrates the continued possibility of creating challenging, unsaturated benchmarks without having to rely on expert domain knowledge. You'll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible.</div>

Each question is so far above the best mathematicians, even someone like Terrence Tao claimed that he can solve only *some* of them 'in principle'. o1-preview had previously solved 1% of the problems. So, to go from that to this? I'm usually very reserved when I proclaim something as huge as AGI, but this has SIGNIFICANTLY altered my timelines. If you would like to check out the benchmark/paper click [here](https://epoch.ai/frontiermath).

Time will only tell whether any of the competition has sufficient responses. In that case, today is the biggest step we have taken towards the singularity.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">I disagree. Yes, it's extremely difficult questions from niche sections of math, but that's still in the data. Not those questions but math in general. There is a structured order to Math problems that makes it for ML learning much easier to learn. ARC-AGI is random nonsense.  Questions which are intuitively easy for most even average intelligence people but extremely difficult for AI because it rarely if ever encounters similar stuff in data and if it does even slight reordering of things completely changes to how LLM sees it while for a human if square is in the middle or in the corner doesn't matter at all. The fact that LLMs is able to approach this completely new problem for it and able to consistently solve it is a very big deal.

Here are some predictions for 2025, ARC-AGI Co-founder said they are going to develop another benchmark. I think they will be able to create another benchmark where LLMs barely register but humans will perform at 80-90% level. I think in area of creative writing o3 is still going to be next to useless compared to a professional writer, but it is going to be dramatically better than o1, and it is going to show first signs of being able to write something that has multiple levels of meaning the way professional writers can.  And I think o3 is going to surprise people at level of sophistication it can engage with people.</div>

It scores 75.7% on the semi-private eval in low-compute mode (for $20 per task in compute ) and 87.5% in high-compute mode (thousands of $ per task). It's very expensive, but it's not just brute -- these capabilities are new territory and they demand serious scientific attention."</div>

                    <div class="comment-body">That is kind of the point of scaling inference and model size. And it will continue in the future. Just as will hardware and compute cost continue to improve. This is why 2026 to 2028 is gonna be such a breakthrough, as a lot of chip fabs in construction will come online, which will depress costs of compute massively and increase amount of total compute available.

While that has been the case in the past, the costs involved previously weren't eyewatering. Even massive cost reductions to this model on the scale that we have already seen will leave this massively out of reach for most.

This currently isn't the way to mass cheap intelligence. It's more OpenAI flexing how much resources they have to throw at something.</div>

That's the entire point. If you read the next two sentences in the post -- that's what they're saying -- the best benchmark for AGI being actually achieved is finding yourself *unable* to create a new benchmark where humans outperform AI.

If you *can* move goalposts, by creating a new benchmark test, where AI underperforms humans... You clearly are not looking at AGI. Simple as.</div>

At the same time they just released o1, would they really already have o3 (basically o2) ready to go already? 

Hopefully not just a demo. Also wonder if we get Orion since the information makes it sound like that is the base model that gets post trained to become o3 possibly?</div>

From today's article:
&gt; Still, OpenAI intended to use a new pretrained model, Orion, to develop what became o3.

From August 27, 2024 The Information article https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-shows-strawberry-ai-to-the-feds-and-uses-it-to-develop-orion :
&gt;It isn’t clear whether a chatbot version of Strawberry that can boost the performance of GPT-4 and ChatGPT will be good enough to launch this year. The chatbot version is a smaller, simplified version of the original Strawberry model, known as a distillation. It seeks to maintain the same level of performance as a bigger model while being easier and less costly to operate.
&gt;
&gt;However, OpenAI is also using the bigger version of Strawberry to generate data for training Orion, said a person with knowledge of the situation. That kind of AI-generated data is known as “synthetic.” It means that Strawberry could help OpenAI overcome limitations on obtaining enough high-quality data to train new models from real-world data such as text or images pulled from the internet.

On that note, I think o3 will differentiate from o1 with a focus on multimodality. We never got native multimodal 4o which makes me think one of these reasoning models will have native multimodal (maybe o3 mini to make it more affordable?)</div>

It would be nice if they would say, this model is really good at reasoning, this one is good at code, and this one is a dirty little... nevermind... it's good at role playing chat.

My preference would be if they came out and said "This is o3, it's like o1's dumber brother but he's a good worker"  Not as focused on reasoning but does CoT and follows instructions very well.</div>

The improvements have been incremental vs the dramatic GPT3 to 4 shift and, frankly, we're at a point where improvements won't be as obvious with a vibe check.

&gt;*Furthermore, early data points suggest that the upcoming ARC-AGI-2 benchmark will still pose a significant challenge to o3, potentially reducing its score to under 30% even at high compute (while a smart human would still be able to score over 95% with no training). This demonstrates the continued possibility of creating challenging, unsaturated benchmarks without having to rely on expert domain knowledge. You'll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible.*

They thought that ARC-AGI would stand the test of time and it lasted about 5 years. At this point it takes a team of experts to build a really good unsaturated AI benchmark, and to keep up with the constant treadmill of saturation.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">Exactly, I think these sorts of things (as presented anyway) are largely PR stunts.

To be fair, Anthropic *has* done some impressive research into studying LLM connections under the hood. So just because they engage in some PR stunts doesn't mean I don't think they're doing any real alignment work.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">The issue is that When these things become agentic they're essentially writing their own prompts after receiving the initial task. Think about how a statement can change drastically  in a game of chinese whispers. If you have an agent and give it a specific task as a prompt the thought or "prompt" it gives itself after hours of working on the task could deviate drastically from what you initially intended.

We're even seeing this to an extent now with non agentic models when they have a long chat history which is why Microsofts first solution when Sydney started behaving unhinged a couple of years ago was to limit the chat history to a handful of interactions.

They're chatbots now but they probably wont be in a year or two so this sort of thing is very important. If agentic Claude has intrusive "thoughts" in a year or twos time we want to make sure that it wont act on them</div>

On the one hand I see your point. We almost literally tell it “let’s roleplay. be evil” and when it’s evil we’re like 😱😱😱😱😱😱🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 because it’s literally a next token predictor that will do what you say.

On the other hand, it doesn’t matter if it’s just a next token predictor and is “just roleplaying” when it calls the destroy_all_humans() function during its roleplay while it’s hooked up to nukes.

The obvious solution is to not hook it up to nukes, but that’s reductive, because you can replace nukes with any system with the potential to cause harm. Any system it could be hooked up to that is useful would be able to cause harm too. It needs to be hooked up with one of those systems to be useful in the first place.</div>

No sound.. no buzzing or whirling of engines or propellers. Not sure if it was actually scanning but it seemed to be sorta I don’t know “looking” for something. Black mirror come to life.*

&gt; *Dane Jeffrey Cook (born March 18, 1972) is an American stand-up comedian and film actor. He is known for his use of observational, often vulgar, and sometimes dark comedy. He released six comedy albums: Harmful If Swallowed (2003), Retaliation (2005), Vicious Circle (2006), Rough Around the Edges: Live from Madison Square Garden (2007), and Isolated Incident (2009).*

&gt; *He is one of the first comedians to use a personal webpage and Myspace to build a large fan base, and in 2006 was described as "alarmingly popular". Cook starred in numerous films such as Employee of the Month (2006), Good Luck Chuck (2007), and My Best Friend's Girl (2008). He also acted in Mystery Men (1999), Waiting... (2005), Dan in Real Life (2007), Mr. Brooks (2007) and provided the lead voice role in the 2013 animated sports comedy film Planes, and its 2014 sequel Planes: Fire &amp; Rescue as Dusty Crophopper.*

&gt; *He was the second comedian (after Andrew Dice Clay) to sell out Madison Square Garden's large arena space. In 2006, Retaliation became the highest-charting comedy album in 28 years and went platinum. He performed an HBO special in late 2006, Vicious Circle, a straight-to-DVD special titled Rough Around The Edges (which is included in the album of the same name), and a Comedy Central special in 2009 titled Isolated Incident.*

                        <div class="reply-body">So I’m now fairly certain I saw one of these drones last Thursday night in Philadelphia. 

It flew over my neighborhood at about 10,000-12,000 feet. Could’ve easily been mistaken for a plane, but the cadence of the lights was unusual. The lights on the “wings” would flash green, at 3 and 9 o clock, and then the front and tail would flash red, at 12 and 6 o clock. 

That, apparently, is the exact light pattern that witnesses are describing, and it didn’t match up with the cadence that I saw from conventional aircraft in the area. Drones sightings were reported in my neighborhood that night too, via the Citizen app.

Last night was extremely foggy in San Diego and loads of aircraft were in holding patterns waiting to land. There’s also almost always several military helicopters in the air off of the coast, because they do a lot of training here.

I'm glad Joe is calling out Elon on this, every time this topic is brought up to him he's outright dismissive and just feeds the skepticism as the media runs with it. Here's a recent example:

[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-13938399/Elon-reveals-military-sightings-UFOs-share-evidence-aliens.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-13938399/Elon-reveals-military-sightings-UFOs-share-evidence-aliens.html)

Claims every military UFO sighting is just secret US technology. Completely ignoring documented sightings and incursions going all the way back into the 40s, 50s, and 60s showing the exact same anomalous characteristics.

Claims every military UFO sighting is just secret US technology. Completely ignoring documented sightings and incursions going all the way back into the 40s, 50s, and 60s showing the exact same anomalous characteristics.</div>

It takes thousands of man hours to keep those jets running and pilots need a certain amount of training per month/year to stay qualified. So in December they cram month's worth of flights into the first two weeks so that everyone can enjoy the holidays. 

Normally, there's almost no training flights around Christmas and New Years, so if they're still flying next week then it's something serious, but as of right now increased flight activity isn't that eyebrow raising.</div>

That being said, as a daily observer of ADSB Exchange, military traffic has been greater than normal, especially during evenings and nights. Notably, the number of P8s, R-135s, C-17s, and especially tankers flying during odd hours has increased.

Submission statement: My dad works in the oil fields in Pecos, Texas. He just called and told me about the drones flying overhead. He said there are 18-20 drones that have been flying overhead for over 30 minutes. As you all probably know, this exceeds many hobbyist drone flight times. He tried to get better footage, but said when he tried, many of them drifted away. Said they were flying at approximately 1000ft altitude. If you don’t know, Pecos, Texas is in the middle of nowhere. There shouldn’t be this many, if any, drones in the sky. He said they’ve been there every night for at least a week. 

My dad was in the navy, and I have an FAA part 103 license. This is pretty strange. Although he’s seen 1 triangle craft, no lights, no propulsion, out in Pecos. He works nights and doesn’t tell me about anomalous objects often. We have property in Menard, Texas and it’s pretty dark. We spend a lot of time looking up at night, and he’s very aware of what planes, satellites, stars, and planets look like. I believe him

1964 UFO Incident: Robert Jacobs Explains a UFO Shooting Beams at a Missile

Short video featuring Dr. Robert Jacobs, a former U.S. Air Force First Lieutenant, recounting an incident from September 1964. During a missile test at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Jacobs claims to have filmed a UFO intercepting and disabling a dummy nuclear warhead. The video includes his detailed explanation alongside purported footage of the event.

The authenticity of the footage remains unverified, and its source is unclear. Jacobs has consistently maintained his account over the years, describing how a disc-shaped object allegedly fired beams of light at the missile, causing it to malfunction. He also mentions being instructed by superiors to remain silent about the incident.

For those interested in viewing the video and forming their own opinions, here's the original Facebook post. [https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1D5sFKmc8J/](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1D5sFKmc8J/)

I don't take credit for this video—just sharing it for discussion and curiosity. What are your thoughts on this incident? 👽🛸

In my opinion, the video is just a simulation.

I only posted it because it helps us understand how it all happened.

UFO Destroys Vandenberg Missile l Professor Robert Jacobs Testifies

Professor Jacobs is a respected professor at a major US university. In the 1960's he was in the Air Force. He was the officer in charge of optical instrumentation and his job was to film ballistic missile tests launched from Vandenberg Air Force base in California. In 1964, during a test of the first missile they filmed, they caught on film a UFO traveling right next to the missile. The film showed that from the UFO a beam of light was directed at the missile. The next day he was shown the film by his commanding officer and was told never to speak of this again.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/RobotPizzaMaker:

---

The mayor of Belleville NJ was just on Newsmax saying that after 4 weeks this is still ongoing, and that they are still not buying what the government is selling with regards to these flying objects/drones in the sky



He says that he has personally seen them. "The lack of truth and transparency is doing nothing but fuel social media conspiracies", "these stories are getting crazy"



He even says that he's surprised the government didn't have a cover story ready to go, instead of telling him that he's just imagining things

The following submission statement was provided by /u/JimmyLizard13:

---

A video has surfaced on the internet on an interview that was conducted in 1999 predicting in 2025 we would know about the activities in Groom Lake. 

With all the sightings that have been happening recently is this predicting Project Blue Beam?

Yeah The Calvine UFO file  should have been released after 30 years in 2021 in the UK but the MoD blocked the release of key details until 2076 due to “privacy concerns”. This struck me as very odd. I had thought was probably a fake, but privacy concerns ?</div>

Nope.

This guy is a dipshit. He photographed a point of light out of focus and at wayyyyyy too slow of a shutter speed. You can literally see the autofocus hunt as he clicks the shutter, and using autofocus is something a photographer would not do when shooting light points in the sky.</div>

We don't know what model he's using, but if he had experience taking photos of the sky he'd at least use focus peaking, and manually focus while digitally zoomed in. It's not that hard lol.</div>
