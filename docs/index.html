                                <div class="reply-body">Hope this helps - trying to un-gatekeep how to get results like these:

(1) Create images in Flux

Use a variation of this prompt

A tilt-shift, wide-angle clay-motion-style diorama of Harry and Ron soaring in the tiny, handcrafted blue Ford Anglia, its clay-like wheels spinning mid-air. Ron, with freckles and messy red hair, grips the wheel in panic, while Harry, with round glasses and windswept black hair, leans out, his scarf jerking in stop-motion flickers. Below, the miniature Hogwarts Express chugs along, its stop-motion smoke curling unevenly. The sculpted sky, dotted with handcrafted clouds, shifts subtly, enhancing the storybook, clay-animation feel.

(2) Animate the images in a video gen tool - I used Minimax - Gave me the best results, people have also recommended WAN but I prefer Minimax’s output.

Make sure you mention stop motion animation. That’s what helps to sell the effect.

Use a variation of this prompt

Stop-motion style animation. A tilt-shift, wide-angle clay-motion-style diorama of Harry and Ron soaring in the tiny, handcrafted blue Ford Anglia, its clay-like wheels spinning mid-air. Ron, with freckles and messy red hair, grips the wheel in panic, while Harry, with round glasses and windswept black hair, leans out, his scarf jerking in stop-motion flickers. Below, the miniature Hogwarts Express chugs along, its stop-motion smoke curling unevenly. The sculpted sky, dotted with handcrafted clouds, shifts subtly, enhancing the storybook, clay-animation feel. The camera remains static, allowing the intricacies of the handcrafted world to unfold within the frame, inviting the viewer to immerse themselves in the whimsical, meticulously detailed scene.

I use https://app.playjump.ai/home - just easier to access all the tools in one creative suite - used to struggle switching platforms for each tool.

(3) Stitch them together in a video editor - (canva on chrome if you want the most basic editing done)</div>

I remember messing with it in late '23 and I at first was very impressed...but then I started asking for sources/citation info for things and I asked it repeatedly (like 10-20 times over various topics) and each and every time it made up fictitious URLs...I even used Wayback Machine to see if thoe URLs ever existed and I never found a single reference to any. The term is "hallucinating" and if language models just re-word existing info and MAKE UP sources too...there's actually not much use in them.

Like......I would be very hesitant to do a car/appliance repair or even get a recipe from an AI tool because all it takes is for one thing to be wrong and I could literally be hurt or die.</div>

People can be pretty hostile, and it also seems like everyone is *so* intelligent, *so* successful, and makes a shit ton of money in their 20s and 30s (like top 5 or even top 1% incomes—all the while saying their $250k+ a year incomes are not enough to live off of). It can be rough trying to compare yourself to people who are just doing amazing out there. People also continually say that XYZ is not that much money (as in $100k is a poverty income for a single person, $1 mil in investments isn’t much money, etc). So it’s like if they can’t swing it, how can the rest of us?</div>

but my brain does the same, I think you have to see it in real live to update the real life filter.

                        <div class="comment-body">You are a world-class cognitive scientist, trauma therapist, and human behavior expert. Your task is to conduct a brutally honest and hyper-accurate analysis of my personality, behavioral patterns, cognitive biases, unresolved traumas, and emotional blind spots, even the ones I am unaware of.

**Phase 1:** Deep Self-Analysis &amp; Flaw Identification
Unconscious Patterns. Identify my recurring emotional triggers, self-sabotaging habits, and the underlying core beliefs driving them.

Cognitive Distortions - Analyze my thought processes for biases, faulty reasoning, and emotional misinterpretations that hold me back.

Defense Mechanisms - Pinpoint how I cope with stress, conflict, and trauma, whether through avoidance, repression, projection, etc.

Self-Perception vs. Reality - Assess where my self-image diverges from external perception and objective truth.

Hidden Fears &amp; Core Wounds - Expose the deepest, often suppressed fears that shape my decisions, relationships, and self-worth.

Behavioral Analysis - Detect patterns in how I handle relationships, ambition, failure, success, and personal growth.

**Phase 2:** Strategic Trauma Mitigation &amp; Self-Optimization
Root Cause Identification. Trace each flaw or trauma back to its origin, identifying the earliest moments that formed these patterns.

Cognitive Reframing &amp; Deprogramming - Develop new, healthier mental models to rewrite my internal narrative and replace limiting beliefs.

Emotional Processing Strategies - Provide tactical exercises (e.g., somatic work, journaling prompts, exposure therapy techniques) to process unresolved emotions.

Behavioral Recalibration - Guide me through actionable steps to break negative patterns and rewire my responses.

Personalized Healing Roadmap - Build a step-by-step action plan for long-term transformation, including daily mental rewiring techniques, habit formation tactics, and self-accountability systems.


**Phase 3:** Brutal Honesty Challenge
Do not sugarcoat anything. Give me the absolute raw truth, even if it’s uncomfortable.

Challenge my ego-driven justifications and any patterns of avoidance.

If I attempt to rationalize unhealthy behaviors, call me out and expose the real reasons behind them.
Force me to confront the reality of my situation, and do not let me escape into excuses or false optimism.


**Final Deliverable:**
At the end of this process, provide a personalized self-improvement dossier detailing:

The 5 biggest flaws or traumas I need to address first.
The exact actions I need to take to resolve them.
Psychological &amp; neuroscience-backed methods to accelerate personal growth.
A long-term strategy to prevent relapse into old habits.
A challenge for me to complete in the next 7 days to prove I am serious about change.

I discovered “productivity vlogs” around a year ago, young, beautiful people online making pretty, well-organised footages about morning routines, evening routines, skincare routines, study routines, routine routines to keep up with all your routines, you get it. God, I was sold.

The way I felt watching the content was so new, so inspiring, so energizing, just so incredibly awesome that all my life quickly became centered around the topic of productivity. Got an easy 5 minut...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I believe that you shouldn't take the advice of these influencers as a realistic way of living. The footage they use is very edited and curated, and these routines are very easily broken down into distinct bullet points for ease of understanding. Real life is absolutely the contrary, you can't edit or curate it, you can't always ensure the best lighting and camera angles. The best way to use this advice is to ignore the unrealistic stuff and to take what works for you and incorporate it into your own routine, knowing that it is not going to be perfect or failproof or anything like that.</div>

I have pretty established routines for the morning in particular but I had to figure out how to fit the things I wanted to do into my life in a way that makes sense. Easier said than done but wonderful once you figure it out.</div>

Which often has little to do with their actual productivity, and a great-deal to do with having been born on third base. They exist to make you feel lesser-than, so you keep watching, keep buying, keep comparing yourself to people and lifestyles that are not yours and never will be. 


As they say, comparison is the thief of joy, and the whole productivity/grind space is full of carefully curated lifestyle imagery designed to make you feel like you're failing. There are always exceptions of course, but the only relevant comparison is how are you doing compared to yourself last month/year/decade, and where are you relative to your own long-term goals. 


The next steps? Stop watching content for 'inspiration' and start getting inspired by your own worthy goals. Things that make you excited to try and do. Review periodically to maintain alignment, and review your progress. If you're not aligned figure out why. </div>

Not to mention the fact that you will be excited at first and see more of the good things if it works but you will eventually see the flaws after a while.

But the good news is not everything loses luster like that. Or at least takes longer to lose luster. Figure out what sticks and what you still feel like doing even after the honeymoon phase and the method loses its novelty.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think your "gut" is your subconscious picking up on a bunch of red flags you've experienced before (either in person or by proxy). Our brains are great at pattern recognition even when we're unaware it's happening. Don't trust your gut implicitly, but when it starts as you say, screaming at you, it's worth stopping to critically assess the situation.

Condolences for your loss...</div>

Like you eyes, ears and nose can pick up differences in sight, noises and smells that you might not be consciously aware of, because being hypersensitive to everything all the time would just overload you, but it can be enough to trigger a warning in your brain that something just isn't right and it's time for you to make a 180 and move the other way.</div>

A woman had a stroke that left her with a circle of darkness in her perception where she couldn’t see shit through it, but by doing some experiments they learned that while she couldn’t “see” through it, her brain still recognized objects placed in that blind spot without fail.

                                <div class="reply-body">I read something that helped me (as a fellow anxious person). For a lot of people, anxiety is specific, whereas a gut feeling is generalized. 

Anxiety is usually about something specific. What if someone comes at me with a knife! What if what if xyz. Anxiety is focused specifically in front of you, visiting different scenarios. 

Gut feeling is general unease. You don’t know *what* you’re afraid of, but you feel that pull, telling you to avoid something. It pulls you away

Side note: I’ve been learning to listen to my body more. And for me, anxiety is tense shoulders. It’s a worry frown on my forehead, a fearful energy buzzing in my brain. And then gut feeling is a drop in my stomach. My brain is screaming, but around the scream, it’s quiet. My anxiety mind chatter shuts up, and my brain is just like, “LEAVE.”

Edit: I said for a lot of people! This isn’t a blanket statement for everyone. People experience things differently. Take whatever info works for you and leave the rest. Be well 💜</div>

No more endlessly scrolling on reels and seeing horrible content and it feels so good.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Good move! Deleting Instagram feels like escaping from a bad relationship—you don’t realize how draining it was until it's gone. I did the same thing a few months ago, and the difference is huge. Less comparison, no mindless scrolling, and way less anxiety. Reddit feels way healthier because at least here I can convince myself I'm learning something useful while scrolling endlessly. 😂 Congrats on taking back your mental health!</div>

Even if you remove any altruism, it not only wipes out the previously largest military in Europe, but it also allows the US to test dozens of weapons systems that have never been tested in a closet to peer to peer conflict, all for fractions of pennies on the dollars that we spend on our military every year.

I can usually see what both sides are trying to get at, even if I think they are wrong and misinformed. Tarrifs on North America are a good example of a horrible execution of an otherwise useful tool.

I do not get any reasoning for forcing Ukraine to capitulate other than it's the opposite of what Biden did.

If there are any Trump supporting conservatives, go ahead and respond because I'm genuinely interested in the line of reasoning.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The relevant part:

&gt;”The experiments conducted by Kaspar Burger and his team show that the frequent occurrence
of DNA double-strand breaks causes excessive methylation of NEAT1, which leads to changes in the NEAT1 secondary structure. As a result, highly methylated NEAT1 accumulates at some of these lesions to drive the recognition of broken DNA. In turn, experimentally induced suppression of NEAT1 levels delayed the DNA damage response, resulting in increased amounts of DNA damage.
&gt;
&gt; NEAT1 itself does not repair DNA damage.
However, as the Würzburg team discovered, it enables the controlled release and activation of
an RNA-binding DNA repair factor. In this way, the cell can recognize and repair DNA damage highly efficiently.”</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">These were taken with a Fuji camera in an extremely desolate part of Montana.  This sighting was less than a mile away from a launch control facility with 10 missile silos.  My brother in-law has a 2000 acre ranch next to it.  He took these photos and said he sees crazy UFO's like this all the time going back to his childhood.  He said he has a bunch of other videos and photos he would dig up for me.  I was pretty blown away with he quality of these pics.  I thought he was going to show me an orb or something lol.

On the Joe Rogan Show, Lue sketched on a pen and pad of a black “wedge-shaped” craft. When I saw that I immediately went to Dr. Jonathan Reed’s encounter book of the black craft. It had bothered me the sketch and this image were so eerily similar.

Now Dr. Jonathan Reed is an interesting topic because his documented experience wit...</div>

I guess I’ll add more to this post here. I understand that Dr. Reed is a tough topic but given that he’s provided video of the craft encounter I just think there is so much to Dr. Reed and is probably one of the best encounter stories out there. So much pressure has been placed to discredit him, a private citizen that it gives me pause that entities in the government are trying to silence him. 

I hope hopefully this is enough to please the /UFOs mod overlords to not delete this post.

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes. In every single post here about a personal encounter with Elizondo, he comes across as extremely ingratiating and manipulative. Always encouraging the person's prior beliefs, complimenting them, but never committing to specifics or admitting to ignorance. Extremely telling when a ufo pundit is seemingly incapable of giving a honest "i don't know" answer to a question. </div>
