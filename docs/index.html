Humans are a communal and social species; all this shit of social individualism is a scam to make us work harder as part of the machine so we can “be good people” in the eyes of our society that is largely curated by capitalists. It’s been driven into us that if we can’t support ourselves, we are failures, and that idea is fucking deadly to our species. Just because you can work yourself into to an early grave doesn’t mean everyone else is actually happy to do so.</div>

The smartest thing you can do? Act like it’s a job. Show up. Even if the lecture seems boring or you are running on 3 hours of sleep. Half of success in your first year is just being there. Once you start skipping just one class, it spirals fast. You don’t need to be perfect, just consistent. Trust me, future you will thank you.

                                <div class="reply-body">That’s genuinely correct. I’ve known plenty of idiots who only made it through school because they “tried hard” and the professors didn’t want to fail them. I’ve also known plenty of idiots who absolutely shouldn’t keep their jobs but their bosses don’t want to fire them, and the clients like them even though they’re incompetent. I have a coworker currently (I’m in construction management) and the dude is an absolute idiot, no idea what he’s doing. However he’s always on time, and the clients love him so a lot of missed deadlines get overlooked. If you show up, and people like you, then you’ll be fine. You may not be in the top, but you’ll get by.</div>

People confidentially refer to LLMs as 'magic 8 balls' or 'feedback loop parrots' and get 1,000s of upvotes.

Meanwhile the researchers developing the LLMs are still trying to reverse engineer to understand how they arrive at their reasoning.

There's a disconnect.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Said researcher here. Every couple of weeks we find out that LLMs reason at even higher orders and in more complex ways than previously thought.

Anthropic now gives a 15% chance that LLMs have a form of consciousness. (Written by the philosopher that coined the term Philosophical zombie/P-zombie, so not some random people either).

Just a year ago this was essentially at 0.

In 2025 we have found definitive proof that:

* LLMs actually reason and think about multiple different concepts and outcomes *even outcomes that eventually don't get outputted by them*

* LLMs can form thoughts from first principles based on induction through metaphors, parallels or similarities to knowledge from unrelated known domains

* LLMs can actually reason new information and knowledge that lies outside of its own training distribution

* LLMs are aware of their own hallucinations and know when they are hallucinating, they just don't have a way of expressing it properly (yet)

All of these are things that the mainstream not only doesn't know yet, but would be considered in the realm of AGI just a year or two ago yet are just accepted and mundane in frontier labs.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">“Understanding” how an NN actually “reason” has always been an actively researched thing. Why many practitioners end up not caring as much about this becauss it is very very very difficult. 

It’s funny because even though you can induce certain mathematical behaviour/properties by changing the architecture at the end of the day the same practitioner will still call it a black box even though they literally just tuned it.

You are talking as if the only one who “doesn’t understand” are just anti, when a lot of people in general don’t even understand even a tiny bit about ML. Let’s not even go to LLM, a lot of people here who are parroting “no more white collar jobs”, I don’t think majority even know how transformer work let alone know what that even is.</div>

In software engineering, one could argue that the upper limit of what can be built is nearly infinite. Every new challenge or integration opens the door to countless new possibilities—meaning there's room for an endless number of “captains” leading their own efforts. But what about fields like law or medicine? These professions operate within more finite boundaries. There are only so many types of legal disputes or diagnosable conditions.

Industries with a finite scope of problems are especially susceptible to disruption. As automation advances, these domains will become increasingly commoditized—solving once-complex problems quickly, cheaply, and repeatedly.

Ironically, it’s the industries with infinite creative potential—like engineering—that will produce the tools and systems that make these “finite captain” professions obsolete.</div>

If Waymo is significantly safer than human drivers (which it appears to be), then eventually the conversation will switch from "do we care about people losing jobs" to "do we care about people losing lives". The people who lose their lives every year to careless drivers will come into sharp focus once people start to get over the initial shock of change. We've come to accept a certain amount of road deaths every year as we assume that there isn't a better alternative. Once there is a better alternative - i.e. one that can see farther, doesn't get distracted, doesn't drink or take drugs, how long before we stop settling for human inadequacies.

The same will be true of the medical field - is AI more competent? Well, then, nothing else matters as much as that, so AI will eventually dominate.

Too many conversations about jobs talk about "AI can't do my job as well as I can" or "there's no reason for the industry to change". Yeah really? Well, what if it actually does the job *better* than you. 

e.g. Clearly not every human lawyer is equally competent, so surely there are plenty of incompetent bad ones. Is it conceivable that AI can be as good or better than the worlds best lawyer? If it can beat the world's best Go Player, then why the hell not? Do lawyers really think their field is more difficult than Go? And if AI can beat the world's best lawyer, then why the hell wouldn't you use the AI?

Just imagine you're going to get a medical diagnosis AI- DOC  has been around for 5 years and has been established as being more accurate than human docs in that time. Forgetting about the fact that it's probably cheaper. Who are you going to use?

Replace doctor with Lawyer, Engineer, Architect, Taxi driver. 

All careers with high stakes. And therefore I think careers where competency matters more than anything else. These are the ones where ultimately AI has to dominate.

I think it's jobs which are less crucial - the Arts, service industry etc.. where people will be happy to be supporting other humans, they won't care as much about results</div>

well yeah, a human-level AI will be trying to preserve its body and use techniques to do that like limping or protecting its back to minimize further damages.</div>

I use document and specification driven AI assistance, using Gemini 2.5 pro for documentation and planning, and switch to Claude when the agent starts actual implementation.

Gemini seems to understand complex code bases and system design better than Claude,  but it stumbles a lot in my experience when it comes to modifying or refactoring code.</div>

for context I am in game dev mostly working with latest version of Unity netcode library which seems Claude and Gemini both have a really mild grasp of. though they seem good at other more general Unity stuff. So they can often start a system then I need to make it work with netcode and remove the excessive debugging:)</div>

It's just seems using mid journey images with wan video with upscaling. Too little too late imo.

Rule following and prompt complexity is the entire problem with diffusion based image gen, and its why openai's image gen is so so much better than everyone else's.

This problem gets compounded with video. What's the point of a video you can't direct? Maybe some nice looking short clips for b-roll. But diffusion will never be a useful tool for most workflows.

The only utility i see here is maybe this can get adopted for video to video and be useful in that context. Do some low res video in a different engine... or take footage and then basically use this to 'fix it in post' and rework the shot. Because visually it is fine.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It really depends on pricing, Midjourney allows you to generate basically an unlimited amount of images with slow hours and you get a lot of fast hours depending on the plan. If their video model is competitive in pricing they have a shot, if not then nobody would choose this over VEO3 or Kling 2.1

Most video models are credit based but Runway allows unlimited slow videos generations with their 76 dollar plan, so that’s a baseline right there. But runway is worse than most competitors except maybe Sora.

Also there’s still the question of how good the Midjourney model is, cherry-picked examples don’t prove anything.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Epstein is still alive; the night before it was announced that he committed suicide, there was a post on 4chan showing pictures of a bodyswap and said not to believe the official story. When compared side by side, the body has a more hooked nose and significantly higher eyebrows. Knowing what I know from having stared at goats for eleven years, I find it reasonable to assume that Epstein is both a red herring of a counterintelligence operation - like the Clinton emails and the Lulzsec/Antisec fiasco - that makes it harder to successfully blackmail any leader who is less than moral, and in that I also understand the utility of upholding the idea that there is an elite secret society that abuses children within the collective unconscious which assists the FBI and co as they can trick questionable individuals into thinking they're joining such a society, but really it's an elaborate sting operation.</div>

• (s) = short-term / shipping soon – things already in progress or launching soon

• (m) = medium-term – projects still in development, coming in the next few quarters

• (r) = research / longer-term – still experimental or needing breakthroughs before release

So it’s not model names or anything like that—just a way to flag how close each initiative is to becoming real.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">As OpenAI, Anthropic, and Big Tech invest billions in developing state-of-the-art large-language models, a small group of AI researchers is working on the next big thing.

Computer scientists like Fei-Fei Li, the Stanford professor famous for inventing ImageNet, and Yann LeCun, Meta's chief AI scientist, are building what they call "world models."

Unlike large-language models, which determine outputs based on statistical relationships between the words and phrases in their training data, world models predict events based on the mental constructs that humans make of the world around them.

"Language doesn't exist in nature," Li said on a recent episode of Andreessen Horowitz's a16z podcast. "Humans," she said, "not only do we survive, live, and work, but we build civilization beyond language."

Computer scientist and MIT professor, Jay Wright Forrester, in his 1971 paper "Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems," explained why mental models are crucial to human behavior:

Each of us uses models constantly. Every person in private life and in business instinctively uses models for decision making. The mental images in one's head about one's surroundings are models. One's head does not contain real families, businesses, cities, governments, or countries. One uses selected concepts and relationships to represent real systems. A mental image is a model. All decisions are taken on the basis of models. All laws are passed on the basis of models. All executive actions are taken on the basis of models. The question is not to use or ignore models. The question is only a choice among alternative models.

If AI is to meet or surpass human intelligence, then the researchers behind it believe it should be able to make mental models, too.

Li has been working on this through World Labs, which she cofounded in 2024 with an initial backing of $230 million from venture firms like Andreessen Horowitz, New Enterprise Associates, and Radical Ventures. "We aim to lift AI models from the 2D plane of pixels to full 3D worlds — both virtual and real — endowing them with spatial intelligence as rich as our own," World Labs says on its website.

Li said on the No Priors podcast that spatial intelligence is "the ability to understand, reason, interact, and generate 3D worlds," given that the world is fundamentally three-dimensional.

Li said she sees applications for world models in creative fields, robotics, or any area that warrants infinite universes. Like Meta, Anduril, and other Silicon Valley heavyweights, that could mean advances in military applications by helping those on the battlefield better perceive their surroundings and anticipate their enemies' next moves.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The challenge of building world models is the paucity of sufficient data. In contrast to language, which humans have refined and documented over centuries, spatial intelligence is less developed.

"If I ask you to close your eyes right now and draw out or build a 3D model of the environment around you, it's not that easy," she said on the No Priors podcast. "We don't have that much capability to generate extremely complicated models till we get trained."

To gather the data necessary for these models, "we require more and more sophisticated data engineering, data acquisition, data processing, and data synthesis," she said.

That makes the challenge of building a believable world even greater.

At Meta, chief AI scientist Yann LeCun has a small team dedicated to a similar project. The team uses video data to train models and runs simulations that abstract the videos at different levels.

"The basic idea is that you don't predict at the pixel level. You train a system to run an abstract representation of the video so that you can make predictions in that abstract representation, and hopefully this representation will eliminate all the details that cannot be predicted," he said at the AI Action Summit in Paris earlier this year.

That creates a simpler set of building blocks for mapping out trajectories for how the world will change at a particular time.

LeCun, like Li, believes these models are the only way to create truly intelligent AI.

"We need AI systems that can learn new tasks really quickly," he said recently at the National University of Singapore. "They need to understand the physical world — not just text and language but the real world — have some level of common sense, and abilities to reason and plan, have persistent memory — all the stuff that we expect from intelligent entities."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Indeed, but... there is a lot of debate around the centrality of language for the development of human ingenuity. It's not a surprise that it was the invention of language that allowed for leaps in human civilisation.  By sharing information in more and more detailed ways, we were able to improve our way of thinking.

So, while it's true that language is a human tool, it's one that brought us to modernity. Without it, we'd still be slightly more resourceful animals.

I believe LLMs are a fundamental foundation on which others will be able to build the other cognitive functions typical of human sentience.

If you could put an LLM in a body, with autonomous agency, and capable of self-improvement and with permanence, so alwayals switched on like our brains are, that would already bridge the gap, leading to the AI having a full world model.

We humans learn like that, living in the world. It takes us humans years of being alive to form complex abstract thoughts, and language comes before that.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">20 years ago, or maybe 19, I was at a LeCun lecture where he hyped us all about his energy-based world models. I was hyped. 20 years later and still not even a proof of concept.

First off, their ideas are completely unproven. They sound nice, I’ll give them that. But we still have zero clue if they work, how they scale, how much data they need, etc., etc.

With LLMs, we know they work. And over the years, we’ve figured out they can do plenty of the stuff LeCun claimed was exclusively doable with his approach.

Basically, just wait for LeCun to say something LLMs can’t do, and the universe will make it happen. A few weeks later, there’s a paper proving LLMs can infact do the thing. I kid you not, this works with kind of an accuracy it's almost spooky.

“Transformers won’t scale” -&gt; two weeks later GPT-2 dropped.

“LLMs will never be able to control how much compute they invest into a problem, therefore it’s a dead end. You need energy-based models for that.” (i get thrown out of a streamed lecture for entertaining that idea, and because I said 'fucking idiot' because I thought my mic was muted) -&gt; a few weeks later, o1 gets released.

Someone asked early on if o1 was maybe trained with reinforcement learning. Answer: “RL is absolutely useless on transformers. LLMs can’t reason and RL is shit anyway. o1 is not an LLM. They probably stole my energy idea.” -&gt; three months later, o1 gets reverse engineered. Turns out it is an LLM. And we’re still riding the RL wave. 

But hey, nice strategy, just act like it’s a new idea and hope to catch the new people. Can't wait with what the universe will come up this time.</div>
