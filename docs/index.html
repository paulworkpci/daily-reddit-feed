                        <div class="comment-body">It looks like a really promising system as the base models continue to improve. I think it will ultimately be limited by the amount of information that isn’t available on the open web (i.e. behind a paywall, in a textbook, held in private or government databases, non-digitised documents etc.). Partnership agreements for access to these sources are probably going to become pretty important soon.</div>

It's honestly straight bullshit that your research can be funded by tax payer dollars and then the findings get published behind the paywall of private organizations. Should be illegal.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Plus users to get it in about a month, unclear whether it is the same o3 model or smaller, but higher rate limits expected soon too.

“Deep research in ChatGPT is currently very compute intensive. The longer it takes to research a query, the more inference compute is required. We are starting with a version optimized for Pro users today, with up to 100 queries per month. Plus and Team users will get access next, followed by Enterprise. We are still working on bringing access to users in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the European Economic Area. 

All paid users will soon get significantly higher rate limits when we release a faster, more cost-effective version of deep research powered by a smaller model that still provides high quality results. 

In the coming weeks and months, we’ll be working on the technical infrastructure, closely monitoring the current release, and conducting even more rigorous testing. This aligns with our principle of iterative deployment. If all safety checks continue to meet our release standards, we anticipate releasing deep research to Plus users in about a month.”</div>

It's already ASI in many aspects, despite being stupid on many things which are easy  for humans.</div>

# Weyauwega, Wisconsin UFO (February 1, 2003)

On February 1, 2003, in Weyauwega, Wisconsin, a woman and her son witnessed a disc-shaped craft with a triangular pattern of lights on its underside. The woman had a camera in hand, taking pictures of her son sledding, when he pointed out the object in the sky. She quickly aimed her camera upward and captured multiple images. The object appeared solid and disc-shaped, with lights that cycled in different patterns. It moved silently across the sky before disappearing into the distance.

The witness remained anonymous, and no further details were provided. Investigators analyzed the photographs and found no clear signs of manipulation. The images showed expected JPEG compression artifacts from early 2000s digital cameras. A tree branch in front of one of the lights appeared “washed out,” likely due to overexposure.

Multiple UFO sightings were reported across Wisconsin around the same time. The case remains unexplained, with no known aircraft or logical explanation matching the object.

# Albuquerque, New Mexico UFO (July 4, 2019)

On July 4, 2019, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a witness observed a black matte teardrop-shaped object falling from the sky while watching fireworks. The object descended rapidly before stopping and hovering above their house. It then changed direction toward the street, remaining low enough that the witness estimated they could have touched it with a firefighter’s lift.

The craft emitted a low hum and made rumbling noises when what appeared to be an exhaust system activated. The exhaust resembled that of a jet but did not produce the same sound. The object had a faint, fuzzy field around it.

After hovering, it began to sparkle before dissipating into nothing, leaving behind significant smoke. The witness reported a strong feeling of connection to the object.

The case was reported later that month, on July 28, 2019. Albuquerque has had previous UFO activity, and the description of this object closely matches one reported by pilots at Eglin Air Force Base, which was referenced in Congressional UFO hearings in 2023. The case remains unexplained.

                        <div class="comment-body">I moved near Weyauwega in 2005 and met a handful of people who saw that craft - it was a popular topic in the area for a while.  Back then I was a skeptic and didn't really believe the phenomena, but found it very interesting that so many had claimed to see the same thing.  I didn't see these photos until a few years ago and it was very similar to what was described to me years back.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Bingo.

This is the huge breakthrough that will reduce hallucinations and approach AGI (human level error checking).

When Agents can fact check with primary sources, and are given enough time to think (1 hr - weeks +), is when hallucinations will not become an issue.

I honestly don't even think it'll take till the end of the year. This space is moving very, very fast.</div>

As per my country’s law, once an employee becomes permanent, the company has got to retrain the employee if they’re no longer useful at their role due to technological disruption.

And if they can prove I can’t be of help anymore, then they can fire me, but they’ll have to pay me a handsome severance pay package and send me off to social security, which will mean I will probably be able to still eat for a 1-2 years more at least.</div>

I am so lost &amp; it’s hurting me inside, my parents tell me and ask me why I’m living like this etc.

That means giving yourself a bedtime and sticking to it, making a daily routine that involves self care and activity and some human contact, if you can, and works those things into your work and school schedule.

That means not being afraid to dream and make a plan to get there.

Otherwise, you’re stuck, and it’s your choice to stay that way, because nobody is coming to save your but you. And you can totally do this one baby step at a time, friend.</div>

The majority of Americans, even ones who vote, do not "follow" politics. But many of the ones who don't vote go further than that - they deliberately avoid it. They don't read about it, they don't watch the news, and they won't discuss it because it doesn't interest them even a little.

There are a *lot* of people like that. If you're closely following multiple political stories, if you can name more than a handful of elected and appointed officials, if you can name specific bills and laws that were recently passed, you're part of a small minority. 

The number who actually bother spending time on a site like Reddit and discussing it on purpose is an even smaller minority. 

Half of those people probably have no idea what's even happening as a result of the election, and will vaguely wonder later this year why prices are going up so fast again...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Voter turnout for this election was 58%, which is about on par with every presidential election. Around 40% of the country never cares about voting.

I know several people who are in this 40%, and asked them why, and it basically always comes down to the fact that they think their vote doesn’t matter.</div>

I have some theories leading up to this point, but those notwithstanding, Putin is laughing his way to the bank watching the US demolish 70 years of US-Canada-Mexico and U.S.-NATO diplomacy. 

Strong ties with the rest of the world is the only bulwark to Russian and Chinese aggression, and now we’re wide open to be pounced on.</div>

You'll probably feel anxious the first few days but it gets better. Maybe try meetup groups when u get some free time from studying? Even just one social thing a month is better than being stuck online 24/7. The toxic online stuff just makes loneliness worse tbh.</div>

You absolutely do and are in the perfect situation to meet new people who share the same interest. Don't do things alone, engage in workshops, network with others, join study groups, and try to connect with people irl. When you meet someone that shares your interests have lunch with them or go to the bar with them to discuss your shared interest.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">25 here! I've noticed that I spend a lot of time texting my Discord friend on my phone. My solution now is to have an alt for internet friends and an account for irl. The irl account account goes on my phone+PC while the internet friends account is on my PC only. Keeps me from constantly texting internet friends on my phone.



I've noticed I spend less time on it because of this. Beforehand, I'd be constantly checking their chat and notifications. They'll still be friends regardless how much you text.


About the loneliness, you can still text them when you're feeling down: ask them if they want to play a game, watch a movie, or just talk about your day. If they're true friends, they'll care and still be there for you.</div>

A few months after that, I said it would arrive in 2–3 years. But now, I want to correct it by saying it will arrive sooner than that. I would also like to say that AGI will first be announced in Japan.</a></div>

So I’ve learned that when I feel stuck, I stop thinking and just **take one tiny action**—even if I don’t feel like it.

* Open the document.
* Stand up and move.
* Do *one* small thing right now.

Once I’m in motion, it’s easier to keep going. **Productivity isn’t about waiting for motivation—it’s about creating momentum.**

                                <div class="reply-body">Oh man, I feel this so much. I used to think getting started was the hardest part, but sometimes it’s just as easy to do one thing and then immediately slip right back into doing nothing. What’s helped me is finding ways to keep myself in motion instead of stopping after that first action. 
A few things that work for me:
	Stacking actions – I pair a task with something I already do. If I’m making coffee, I use that time to organize my desk. If I open my laptop, I make myself type at least a few lines before switching tabs.
	Setting a super tiny goal – I tell myself, “Just do this for 5 more minutes.” If I still want to stop after that, I can—but most of the time, I keep going.
	Changing my space – If I know I’ll get sucked back into doing nothing, I move to a different spot so my brain registers it as a shift.
I have ADHD, so procrastination is something I’ve had to fight constantly. I won’t pretend I always win, but what’s helped the most is breaking things down into the smallest possible steps so they don’t feel as overwhelming. Even if I don’t get everything done, getting something done keeps me moving forward.
Do you have a specific task you’re struggling with right now? Maybe we can brainstorm a way to make it easier to stick with!</div>

This leak continues to fly under the radar. The redditor who leaked this information and photos in reply to [**this comment**](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/18zv05e/comment/kgk9azu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) later deleted their account.

Dailymail wrote an article about it with the redditor's photos and info included:

&gt;***The leaker said: 'It was hosted by a Wall Street bigwig and his lawyer friend.***

&gt;***Dailymail has since verified that the meeting took place and was told by sources that Coinbase advisor John D'Agostino and high-powered attorney John J. Altorelli hosted the event.***

Here's another thread with more photos and info:

You wanna talk about disclosure? Wheel this thing out and nobody will have any questions whether it's man made or not.
