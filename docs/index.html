The “corruption” we’re supposed to be worried about is working class Americans having government jobs? I know people being impacted by Elon’s crusade who worked meaningful jobs. It’s not going to stop. Everyone will know someone impacted, and it won’t be someone paid $3 mil/year for some bullshit DEI job. 

The VA is being gutted. Veterans are 1/3 of the federal workforce. Their unemployment will skyrocket. The Dept of Ed doesn’t just create curriculum. People will lose the ability to become educated or learn a trade. Prices will go *up* with all of these trade wars. Is this what everyone signed up for? They’re getting revenge at our expense and gutting the country/economy. This is all so fucked.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's sad how Ai efficiency eludes people. Writing code in 30s by an Ai datacenter is way more efficient than spending 4 hours of electricity on your home computer. That's a small scale example. On a big scale we can take a look at alphafold2. Before Ai, they spent 20 years of datacenter compute to find 140k proteins structures while in 1 years with Ai they found the 220 MILLIONS remaining ones.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You're correct, but this IS cherrypicking. AI uses in professional fields like that are wonderful and valid, alphafold2 is a shining example. You can make strong arguments for efficiency there, because it's a goal humans have been working towards for ages. 

However, consider layman usage. Consider AI image generation. By your above argument, every AI image generated would've been created by other means, primarily manual labour. The availability of the technology has caused an explosion in usage and in creating content that 1) wouldn't have existed otherwise, and 2) is absolutely NOT something that's important, practically speaking, like usage in medical or industrial fields.

Plus, Altman is making a huge false equivalency here. Leaky pipes and ChatGPT are not the same. Burgers and ChatGPT are not the same. They don't address similar needs, fulfill similar goals, represent similar issues, or anything, aside from the fact that "water is involved in their production". But all of that aside, this graph to point out how little impact ChatGPT has environmentally is bonkers - burgers (red meat) are absurd consumers of water, and leaky pipes are a major infrastructural flaw. Again, cherrypicking. And "Other Thing Is Worse" is a terrible, terrible defense.

Lastly please consider that Altman is probably a *little* biased. As are folks who are staunchly anti-AI in every form! The reality is almost always somewhere in the middle, but I at least hope that you, dear lovely nerd reading this (I'm now talking to the whole room apparently lol), will approach things with skepticism. Cuz this really is a bad chart.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Energy use isn’t a problem either 

According to the International Energy Association, ALL AI-related data centers in the ENTIRE world combined are expected to require about 73 TWhs/year by 2026 (pg 35): https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/18f3ed24-4b26-4c83-a3d2-8a1be51c8cc8/Electricity2024-Analysisandforecastto2026.pdf




Global electricity demand in 2023 was about 183230 TWhs/year (2510x as much) and rising so it will be even higher by 2026: https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-consumption



So AI will use up under 0.04% of the world’s power by 2026 (falsely assuming that overall global energy demand doesnt increase at all by then), and much of it will be clean nuclear energy funded by the hyperscalers themselves. This is like being concerned that dumping a bucket of water in the ocean will cause mass flooding.

Also, machine learning can also help reduce the electricity demand of servers by optimizing their adaptability to different operating scenarios. Google reported using its DeepMind AI to reduce the electricity demand of their data centre cooling systems by 40%. (pg 37)

Google also maintained a global average of approximately 64% carbon-free energy across their data and plans to be net zero by 2030: https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/google-2024-environmental-report.pdf</div>

Now today it is further confirmed that there will be a “core” omni-modal model capable of both quick responses and reasoning, all in one model.

I created a fairly difficult probability problem. I asked it to o3-mini-high and it came up with really advanced math and the answer looked very good.


I thought "hey let's ask the dumb GPT4o just for fun".



Well GPT4o coded a python function to precisely calculate the exact % by simply simulating 100K times the scenario i described and outperformed o3-mini by essentially cheating :P</div>

You feel like every thought and memory you ever had was just scanned and analyzed and you feel completely vulnerable. That was my experience at least.

But the experience of being outside your body in that moment is just…unexplainable. It feels more real than real. Like you’ve been living your whole life seeing through your cell phone camera and you’ve just opened your eyes for the first time.</div>

I’ve heard others say OBE’s feels more real than real life… Also heard that a lot from people who have had a NDE. 

When you had this, complete communication, what kind of entity was it with? Can you tell more about your experience?</div>

Perplexity was one of the first popular chatgpt wrappers, and Sam has said time and time again that those type of companies are going to get steamrolled as the models get better and better until the wrappers lose their unique features.

He's basically constantly pushing his own hype, talking about how perplexity is better for searching stuff than google, and better for LLMs than openAI.

Obviously both of those statements are false, but he's managed to keep enough engagement going, and that's all he really cares about.</div>

I think there is a middle way. Constantly worrying and talking about these things isn't useful. However, completely ignoring stuff when shit hits the fan is also not useful. That's like being a passive willful victim. We need an appropriate amount of energy spend on things according to their importance.</div>

Make good, calm, reflected choices. Regret is a bitch.  Every single choice you make, ask yourself, "how is this beneficial for me?"

Be careful with how much time you spend on the internet and use technology.  It can easily get addictive and rob you of your limited daily attention.

Sleep, unwind, interact with people face to face, exercise, keep learning, eat well.  SHIELD

Be good</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Forget apps as being the first thing you turn too. 

Start reading books. The more you learn and actually understand the better you will be able to control your emotions / brain / habits. 

Apps will just send you reminders or prompt you. You still need to do the work. 

First, be honest about what your like to change. 

I find listing everything down will be overwhelming. 

Write down three things you want to get control over. 

Maybe it’s health, money and relationships. 

Pick a sport for fun, like social netball / tennis / basketball / indoor soccer. Then also join a gym or yoga studio, whatever floats your boat. While you’re young, try to go 3 times a week for exercise. Or smaller lengths everyday, like a run or yoga session. 

For money, education and habits are key. 

Learn about your superannuation / retirement system in your country. Learn about compounding and interest rates. 
Learn about credit card debt, savings methods and investing. Especially investing. 

Learn how to spend less so you can when you need to. Learn how to pay for things you love and enjoy. But also learn restraint. 

You’ll get a lot of people saying live your life your young you have many years ahead, and then others will say, buckle down and work etc. 
the true answer is both. Love your life, within your means. But don’t give up on your dream holiday or going to a fun music festival if you want it, save up and go have the best time.

I’m 33, and I which I learnt about investing and my superannuation when I was younger. 
Try getting a job that will add this, some retail and hospitality places won’t, but if you can find one that does then pick that over the other. 

Once you start really working, you’ll have money that you’ll need to know what to do with. 
Trust me when I say this, money sitting in your bank accounts “feels nice” but in fact is actually doing nothing except getting eaten away by fees. 

Find a way to invest it in something that will make more money. Start with ETFS. Broad focused ones, that diversify for you. Keep it simple. You only need maximum 5 etfs really. One for American markets, one for Europe or Australia. And maybe you like the sound of investing in sustainability or Asian markets like Japan or china. 

Contributing even $50 a week will change your life when you retire. Ideally $100, but every dollar counts. 

Relationships, they go both ways. Put in effort with your friends that you like and they show interest and effort towards you. Some people will come in and out of your life, that’s okay. Learn how to have boundaries and how to tell your friends about them with care but also respect for yourself. 

Have hobbies, and if you don’t know what they are, try them all. Something to challenge your body and something to challenge your brain, and ideally something social to interact with others and learn how to be a better person or more open minded or friendly or confident. There are lots of reasons why. 

Good luck</div>

Submission Statement: During a UFC interview with Georges St-Pierre, a mysterious disc shaped object appears spontaneously in the background, hovers for a moment, and zooms off at incredible speed. In light of a recent interview with George's, I find this footage relevant. I'm curious if he's aware it even exists.

For example: his grandparents (from mother's side) were literal Canadian Nazis that had to emigrate to South Africa, because of their fucked up political beliefs. And Elon spent a lot of time with them, because his deranged father didn't give a shit about the children. Or his expulsion from PayPal. Or his bullshit claims about Mars missions, Tesla's Robotaxis, Solar City etc. Sociopathic conman with a God complex - that's what he is, which makes him a very convenient tool in the hands of bigger guys.

Like literally, there are some puzzles you can gather and make a picture of Elon himself - still, unless his techno-bros friends will decide to help him and clean his image on the internet as much as they can.</div>

Since OP just wants to post screen shots, here's the article if you actually want to read more about it.

Spoiler, he's just proposing an alternative way of treating addiction for people already in treatment for addiction. It's not a "we're shipping everyone on these list of meds to a labor camp" like the post implies.

It's voluntary, free and an option instead of serving jail time for drug offenses (which has already been in places for ages.)</div>

They go on their own accord and break away from society to learn how to grow food and the discipline that comes with it. It’s very affective fore some people and can provide a little purpose while showing you how to fend for yourself.

Also, it’s the most hippy dippy leftist wing shit you can think of. It’s like living on a commune. Probably closer to Wunderlust than a forced labor camp.

youtube is probably the only one that's still going strong cause people need it for tutorials and stuff. but even there the comments sections feel different than they used to be.

What I keep hearing: 

* Content (video) creation is becoming more sophisticated, using more expensive tools, compared to what existed in, say, 2014 and before. 

* The cost and effort required are way beyond what ordinary users are able or willing to invest. 

* Payoff per unit of investment have reduced over time, unless one gets brand deals. 

...all of which goes to show that there is a clear divide between content creators and content consumers. Leading to youtube at least, becoming a giant content feed. 

Re: comments - My personal take is that they've become fanboy spaces than places for actual discussion.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think people are changing their spaces. TikTok especially has had significant growth over the past few years.

Bluesky is still relatively small with 30 million users, but it's enjoying success too as people continue to migrate from Twitter.

School bans on mobile phones are growing as well, which will reduce usage.

I do think a lot of people are getting fed up with the contemporary internet. But they may just be reducing time online rather than completely walking away.</div>

Too addicted to get off the internet but at the same time, yeah some are actually over it. Funny how the media portrays it as "Hey everyone is addicted to their phones they should get off" and now the desired story, will become "No one is online anymore"</div>

gpt was unironically designed from the onset to sound robotic for safety reasons, so people don't confuse it with a real human. This is also the reason why it's called "GPT" instead of a name like Alexa or Siri. But now with Mira gone...

I think it’s just that AI has infused into society much more deeply than in 2018 when GPT-1 came out.

The other thing I like to do is listen to a single album every time I go somewhere. Metric's Synthetica will forever remind me of Utah, Elliott Smith's From a Basement on a Hill will always remind me of Portland (fittingly), Nirvana by Nirvana will always be associated with driving to meet my senior prom date that lived a town over.

Whatever you can do to link your memory to the experience, do it. Sometimes it's nail clippers or shot glasses or hats or music or socks or just taking a picture of the sunset. 

When you leave it will just be a memory. Do whatever you can to preserve it.</div>

Not happening.

[edit] this realization doesn’t mean I’ve given up. I don’t have kids and I support paying for education. I’m in good health and can still say our healthcare system is predatory as fuck. I can have a great job and recognize the income gap is destroying the country. I don’t ascribe to “my team” politics.</div>

I thought for my entire adult life, that even though the government had corruption, and that we had setbacks all the time, that we were on a general path towards progress, justice, awareness and equality, just to have it all come crashing down spectacularly like this in a few short weeks.

It's been the most worldview-shattering experience of my life. And I'm already well on my way towards emigration. Things will never get better here in my lifetime. The culture is poisoned and consumed by greed and self-absorption. Best to just go somewhere else that better aligns with how I want to live my life. 

My wife and I had been trying for a child before January. Now I don’t want to raise a child here anymore. Conservatives can have their oligarchy paradise they call the US. With their dismantled public education system. I don't want it anymore. It's not my home anymore.</div>
