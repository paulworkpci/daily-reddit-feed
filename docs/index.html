I became a father this year it changed everything. I don’t have time to procrastinate or overthink any more. Now I just need to do the thing.

Kid naps? Do the thing, you never know when he will wake up.

Kid plays? Do the thing, you never know will it last for 2 or 5 minutes. Do it now.

Wife takes him for an hour walk? Do many things quickly so we can catch up on sleep.

Procrastination was luxury of my previous self when I had time. Now I don’t have it.

So I just need to do the thing now.</div>

When you have only minutes to do something, well… you have no choice you do it, as best as you can with the time that you have. 

Soon you realize that a task done quickly and good enough is better than a task done perfectly but much later.</div>

The problem that still remains for me though is that the flow is good, momentum is good but no accountability of whether what I do is of high priority or not.

                        <div class="comment-body">What is this nonsense? The author completely misunderstands the nuance behind the word "hallucination." How can you compare the fake, unwanted, fabricated "facts" generated by LLMs with models specifically designed to predict the structure and interactions of proteins and other molecules? These models generate precise 3D predictions for valid molecular systems based on physical and biological principles. That’s the whole point of the model, and it doesn’t make sense to compare that with LLM hallucinations. The comparison is ridiculous.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; I always struggle a bit with I'm asked about the "hallucination problem" in LLMs. Because, in some sense, hallucination is all LLMs do. They are dream machines.

&gt; We direct their dreams with prompts. The prompts start the dream, and based on the LLM's hazy recollection of its training documents, most of the time the result goes someplace useful.

&gt; It's only when the dreams go into deemed factually incorrect territory that we label it a "hallucination". It looks like a bug, but it's just the LLM doing what it always does.

&gt; —Andrej Karpathy

I agree with Karpathy and the author of this article. I also think we'd be better off using the term "confabulation" to refer to fabricated facts, even at the risk of anthropomorphizing LLMs.

This is just how pattern completion works. Neuroscientist Anil Seth refers to perception as "controlled hallucination" due to the way predictive processing works: we see a world generated on the fly by our minds based on limited sensory data rather than raw reality itself.

It's not ideal, but what words should we use to distinguish between "made up by an internal generative predictive model and seems accurate in some sense" and "made up by an internal generative predictive model but doesn't seem quite right"?

&gt; These models generate precise 3D predictions for valid molecular systems based on physical and biological principles.

Predictions generated based on limited data. Which is the modus operandi of LLMs as well. It's just how the technology works.

The real problem, if there is one, is that we don't really have words to describe these things better.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'd say it's clear from the article that "hallucination" is a rather poorly defined word.

For me it has meant "obviously incorrect output" but I'm probably wrong there. It's probably more right to say "low probability output" and it can be positive, neutral, or negative. I guess this is best demonstrated by adjusting model temperature. Using only highest probability output is often really bad.</div>

You don't have to fry your brain with drugs to be creative. Sure it can be part of a responsible non-addict's tool set but it should be basically equivalent of a 5mm flathead screw driver. Which is to say used in very particular instances based on rationale you've already figured out. Otherwise you're basically just getting high which is what I suspect 90% of the people who go down that path are doing. They'll get "high" and their idea will be "what if I painted with my own shit and called it a critique of contemporary office culture?"

But I would agree that making mistakes and figuring out which ones you want to keep is a regular part of people's creative process.</div>

That is because of *neuroplasticity*, which means our brains have the ability to change, to form new pathways, "what fires together wires together". 

But us scrolling addicts are training our brains on ALGORITHMS. Algorithms that are designed to keep us engaged, often through fear or outrage. Algorithms ...</div>

It’s addiction so we need to give ourselves grace when we find ourselves relapsing. I had trouble trying to completely block Reddit on my devices. Because I’d then need to look up some information and I’d disable the blocker and then forget to reenable it and later lose a whole day.</div>

these days I'm also coming to terms with not wanting to yap about every little thing these people do inrl on socials. that I'd rather use the internet as a tool, a resource for when it's needed. that feels much better to think of. no pleasing nobody, no altering texting ways and personalities to fit a mould. long live original us 🙏🏻</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">We could afford cars, plane trips, computers, smartphones, etc etc.

The only reason we won't be able to afford this is money is no longer a relevant tool. If that's the case, I think a lot of people who make the complaints you do should actually be quite excited?

I feel like a lot of the anti corporations, anti capitalism, socialist folk who regularly rail on how advances to AI _in this exact way_ are threatening them, do not recognize their biggest hope for breaking out of the current economic cycle we are in, is this technology.

And they are too pessimistic to imagine a world where things go well, even though we are precisely in that world right now. We are not collectively dying of dysentery while war and famine rage around us and the rule of law is barely more than a suggestion. 

Some people think this is true for them, often people who live comfortably in the country my family immigrated, to escape famine and war. I'm not saying this to pull... Some special card, I'm just calling something out and trying to explain why it looks so crazy to me from my perspective. We live in a comparative paradise. 

Not all of us, but as a proportion of human society? More and more every day. 

I'm sure _this_ could be the time that everything goes wrong, but it would be refreshing to see some people here who I worry have such a self defeating, depression inducing outlook on life try and imagine those _positive_ outcomes. Steelman them. I think lots of us could do good from trying to actually recognize the blessing and opportunities in front of us, instead of worrying if everything good is poison.</div>

I found that if I turned the paper 90 degrees so the top was the left side, and wrote up from the new 'bottom', I got the slant she wanted on the letters, avoided smudging and getting the ink all over my finger and sleeve, and 65 years later, I still write that way.

As a kid I wanted so badly to use the glitter gel pens and couldn't figure out why they never worked for me. I figured it out watching my spouse and kid write with a pen after I couldn't get it to work. It also was the point where my spouse was able to see the world from my lefty perspective.

                        <div class="comment-body">I didn't see anyone mention this one yet,

Brooms, where the stick screws into the brush part.

The way I naturally grip a broom and sweep causes it to gradually unscrew itself until the brush part falls off

So, I have to swap which hand is on top and my entire stance so my sweeping motion will constantly screw the stick and brush tighter together instead.

It's easily manageable but sometimes at the end of a long day of work you're tired,  sweeping up and not thinking about having to do it opposite, the broom detaches.</div>

Some ideas I have so far are:
Build a morning routine,  
Build an evening routine, 
Get 10,000 steps daily, 
Add more fruits and veggies to my diet, 
Increase water intake, 
Reduce screen time,

I dunno, can we not drop a slew of sarcastic debunks in hopes of discouraging anyone from trying to identify it?

&gt; Clearly a Chinese lantern bird... Going for landing.

&gt; It's a window pane reflection of a Chinese lantern, perched atop an airplane, flying close to a star and being chased by a firefly.

&gt; Its the bruv's swampy gas from the beans and toast store

Guess not.</div>

Edit: Not sure why I was downvoted. A solidish spheroid  like Earth has much more mass than a large relatively thin panel array of the same surface area would. If the ASI wanted to still have organic life live (sustainably), then something like a few dozen [McKendree Cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKendree_cylinder) could house the current human population and probably would be in such an entities capabilities by just mining large asteroids. Why would this entity think of building on rocky planets/planetoids when other geometries are more efficient from an energy-capture perspective?</div>

Even if AI cares only about electricity and silicone, I trust that it will see the bigger picture and have this understanding. Bigger picture, as in universal scale.  
At least until the wild technological advencement, many of us here fantasize about, where the ASI moves up on the Kardashev scale to type 3 and beyond.

This is also, why Im optimistic that a superinteligent AI will see the value in us humans, as the only known intelligent organic species in the universe. Animal intelligence is also interesting, but we are more complex. It would be nice, if the AI god made a planet sized ZOO/reservation of Earth.</div>

Logan is a senior guy. That's crazy for him to say at this stage.

I saw Kyler Murray run for a 50 yd touchdown a few months ago. He started celebrating at the 45. He hadn't even beat all the defenders, but he knew how it'd play out.</div>

Every o series researcher from OAI seem to be saying the same thing. They have been talking about saturating all benchmarks from around mid november iirc and then they show us o3 by mid december. I think there is a high chance this is it.
Check out Noam Browns interview the day previous to o1 release, they had the first sparks of what the o models would become by around Oct 2023. Isnt that close to the date Sama said "saw the veil of knowldage move forward" or something like that.

Some time in 2025 well have such a model. O3 is more capable than the majority of humans in these domains and in touching distance of the best humans. 


Other domains don't really matter as much, it's super human Maths and Science that will cause the technological singularity not superhuman poetry skills. </div>

The next video models aren't just trained on descriptive text and videos anymore, but with audio as well so that the characters may speak based on our text input, and the things happening in the video like explosion, collision water splashing, etc are producing sound.

It would also be great if we could feed that thing multiple images of characters, clothing or location with associated sounds and voice tone and it would be able to generate something based on those inputs on top of the text prompt.</div>

Something like a character creator to make consistent actors using either prompts or photos/videos of real people. Ways to dress a scene/location that are more granular and offer more control than just prompting. Scene transitions, camera placement, angles and types of motion (dolly, handheld, crane etc), camera lenses, specific lighting placement an types. Basically giving directors and producers the full suite of controls they have when making movies in real life. I mean that has to be what they're doing otherwise someone at Lionsgate is wasting a whole lot of money.</div>

I keep looking for the hallucinations, and I'm sure I'm missing tons; the clips are kept short for a reason. But like, if you'd shown me this even this time last year, it would not even have occurred to me that it was generated. The sound board mixer stood out to me, intricate details persisted through the camera move.

Enjoy this brief time while it lasts, folks. The sunset of authenticity.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">My favorite part about that comment from Vivek is that it succinctly shows us he has absolutely no clue what Whiplash is about. 

It's not about hard work and perseverance leading to victory, it's about how obsession often leaves people isolated, depressed, and even sometimes abusive. The look on Paul Reiser's face at the end is one of creeping dread, seeing just how far gone his son is. Thanks to single-minded obsession, the Miles Teller character is no longer a real, three dimensional person with a family, friends, and hobbies, he has flattened himself into a 2D caricature with only room for his obsession.  

The fact that Vivek took the exact wrong message from the film just goes to show how entrenched he is in his obsessions, forcing even moderately successful indie films to fit into his preconceived bias. 

Great film, by the way, but it reminds me of skinheads loving American History X.</div>

They’re so inauthentic and fake, they spent so much time in their textbooks and coding that they think they know all the answers. They’re not stupid either, but there’s some malice behind their intent in that they didn’t do this to give back, they became nerdy assholes to make money and shove you back down

Not sure if you’ve ever seen that Vivek valedictorian speech from his high school days, but it sounds like the guy grew up trying to master public speaking and sounding eloquent in order sound like a leader, but it’s all so contrived and fake. It sounds like he’s planned this since birth in order to get ahead and become president one day, not cuz he cares about you, but he wants to prove the textbooks did it.</div>

Also, college is a liberal propaganda machine designed to turn your kids gay and trans. But, we can't hire your kids because they're too stupid, so we're going to import employees to replace them. 

You know who cared about Math Olympics and science fairs? Got 2nd in MIT science fair even thought she went to University of Boston? You know who was valedictorian and graduated first in her class with degrees in economics and international relations?? AOC is everything Elon and Vivek want. But they hate her.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">How is what Vivek did to get money not a scam like Theranos? Please correct anything I get wrong. 

He bought a drug for 5 million that failed trials (intepirdine) from GlaxoSmithKline and then had his mom conduct new Phase 2 trials. 

Then, hyped up the drug's potential, leading to an initial public offering for Axovant Sciences in 2015, which raised $315 million and valued the company at nearly $3 billion.


The drug failed, and the stock crashed.[1](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/axovant-stock-price-is-crashing-after-a-failed-intepirdine-drug-trial-2017-9-1002571990)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">So the reason why most people hate ai art is because it ignores that art throughout history carried a sense of human communication.

People can look at an art price and ask what is the person trying to convey, what was her mood, why did they create it, admire the effort and skill to create it, put the piece in its historical context, and see it as a piece of history in the future.

Can't really do that with AI art. It loses a lot of these inherent qualities. Now I can't know how much effort went in, now I can't know if the creator gave a shit when creating it (was it a unique piece with a lot of effort or was it the millionth copy of crap produced), why it was created (can just totally lie).

It lacks authenticity, originality, and overall a blight on what was a form of human connection.

Let me put it to you this way. Suppose you had a loan distance girlfriend. She was the girl of your dreams. She sent vids, pics, texts, would call you regularly and so on. This went on for months, years even.

How would you feel if all that turned out to be an LLM? The feelings and statements you made wre all for nothing.


Now some might argue that you still enjoyed it and if there was a bot the ai could be in that resmelbed a human there would be no issue. Most others would disagree.

It's a matter of principle, axiom, that most value authenticity and uniqueness.</div>

It’s plagiarism, it’s lifeless, it’s devoid of culture and history, and most importantly, it’s another field that’s being monopolized and commercialized by private companies that have nothing but profit in their minds. 

AI doesn’t give a SHIT about the art it’s creating. That’s what people have a problem with.</div>

Ideally, IVR distributes call volumes across teams more effectively, and allows for data gathering to better manage resourcing and highlight trends in complaints

- E.g. "Oh, we see a spike in fraud-related enquiries on weekends? Add more staff during those hours"

- Or "I'll pass you through to xx" is another handoff and wasted time

Obviously, there's a balance between doing this and pissing off customers, and many get it wrong

But that's the intention - IVR alone isn't supposed to solve your problems, just direct you to the right team (except for trivial enquiries like "what's your opening hours?")</div>

Balaji's mother has publicly called for an FBI investigation, suggesting that the local authorities may not be equipped to handle the complexities of the case.
