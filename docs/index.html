Last week I used codex to build me a payment integration that looked perfect. Clean error handling, proper async/await, even had rate limiting built in. Except the Stripe API method it used was from their old docs.

Just finished vibe coding an entire IaC deployment for a containerized app and I am pretty jazzed about it.

I am using GitHub CoPilot with the Claude 3.7 LLM and a paid JetBrains IDE (don't judge, they work for me). Having a _real_ IDE, not just an editor, is critical because CoPilot inline suggestions are often hot garbage. However AI chat is great. With the IDE doing code validation, I get proofreading to find any errors and imagined features.

Breaking the work into manageable chunks and working iteratively is key. I estimate that AI, given well composed prompts, gets things over 80% correct and occasionally 95-100% correct. For example today's final feature was green/blue releases using weighted DNS. The chat generated 100% working code and it was 90-ish% what I wanted. I had to make a few tweaks: blue was weighted higher than green (wrong) and the DNS aliases needed swapped over to different variables.

Am I cheating myself? Hells no. I am delivering quality code ahead of schedule. I did essentially the same thing looking at search results pointing to StackOverflow and reference docs. Was that also cheating. Nope. Using all resources available is working smarter, not harder.</div>

but they could release it as an experimental model for Pro users with small rate limits.  
GPT-5 did get 11/12 on the ICPC though, which shows how strong the model is on its own.</div>

Thinking longer is not always more productive/constructive. This is more helpful when it comes to developing a completely new approach. But not for extensive revisions.

But why not try both and share your experiences with us?</div>

This observation was articulated in the 1980s by [Hans Moravec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moravec), [Rodney Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Brooks), [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky), [Allen Newell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Newell), and others. Newell presaged the idea, and characterized it as a myth of the field in a 1983 chapter on the history of artificial intelligence: "a myth grew up that it was relatively easy to automate man's higher reasoning functions but very difficult to automate those functions man shared with the rest of the animal kingdom and performed well automatically, for example, recognition"

                        <div class="comment-body">The only meaningful benchmarks moving forward will be long form project completion and real world results. It's one thing for an AI to oneshot a 2D Javascript game like a frogger or tetris clone, it's another for an AI to do all of the work that goes into designing and making a full scale indie RPG or more complex game on the scale of Stardew Valley or Rimworld, or even a decent visual novel. It doesn't matter if the AI has achieved expert level performance in individual hard programming problems in hackathons or LEETcode or whatever if it still can't manage to pump out a non-trival game or app, which consists of handling hundreds of little, easy problems and seamlessly tying everything together to create a well designed finished product.

Benchmarks are focused too much on highly difficult but small problems and not enough on less "difficult" but larger, more complex projects which require planning, iteration, and design vision. No one individual function in a game like Stardew Valley is difficult to program, it's all very trivial from a coding perspective, but the overall game design and tying together the hundreds of different functions for player movement, economy, NPC movement, date and time and weather, branching story events, etc is still impossible for even the most cutting edge "expert programmer" AIs.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed. We’re at the point of “1 minute AGI” already. The problem now is reliability, deep understanding, and the ability to notice it’s off track and course correct. That I think will be as big of a leap to solve as LLMs themselves were. 

The reasoning models will continue to do better and better until they saturate the benchmarks. Then they’re going to plateau on actually doing things in the real world.

I think once they do solve it, it’s going to all get solved at once or within a year max. Once we have an AI that is completely interchangeable with a human remote senior software engineer, reliability is solved and thus all white collar jobs are solved, and robotics will probably only be shortly behind.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Terminator is overdone and I'd argue we really don't need negative doomer style futures of AI anymore. It was a fun ride back in the 80s - early 90s, but that era is dead. 

It would be much more impressive if he did a very positive take of AI instead, where the "villain" in the narrative was instead something traditionally associated as something positive or even abstract.</div>

I found this quote from 40k about Dark Age of Technology is relevant:

&gt;*Fools have asked ‘why did the Dark Age of Technology end in the fall of humanity?’, and other fools answered back 'folly’, or 'pride’, or 'the worship of progress’, as if these things alone had any meaning. The answer, as the wise know, is simple. It is because finally humanity had the arts at their disposal to make their dreams reality, and the dreams of humanity have ever been the darkest things in all creation."*

Otherwise there are A lot of movies where the AI is neutral like helpful robots. Like Wall.e, Star wars, interstellar. 


There's also transcendence with Johnny Depp that shows the singularity with nano swarms as a relatively neutral or good event.</div>

Where progress grows as fast as we think it might, but that outcomes are more true to a reality we can comprehend. Such as the jump from a medieval society to a modern society.

                        <div class="comment-body">Aren't a good few of these cars stolen anyways, I don't think they care much what happens to them after

&gt; Humphrey admitted that he “would have loved to have thrown this car in the fleet if it were street legal.” Unfortunately, it wore stolen parts from several different cars. The owner wasn’t prosecuted, however, as they were allegedly unaware of its shady origins.

Well that sucks for the owner

&gt; Of the 167 vehicles LMPD has seized for street racing and takeovers since 2023, four of them have gone to auction. Humphrey explained that the proceeds from those auctions went directly to the department. None of them has been added to the fleet as of yet

So over two years they just have 163 cars sitting there taking up space?</div>

I was co sleeping with my baby at the time and kept worrying that one day the picture could fall off the wall, hit the bed frame and the glass in the frame would smash all over us.

I have no clue why people think he is right, because his parents are conservative? 
There is an abundance of arguments that he is left e.g. his girlfriend, the bullets and the fact that no person on the right who listens to Kirk would do that.
Only a clear hateful enemy of Kirk would do that and those people are on the left</div>

I always wished I could have a PhD-level tutor who knew practically everything about everything, could break it all down for me at any level of difficulty, and never got tired of explaining anything I wanted in as many ways as necessary for me to finally understand.

I’m asking LLM’s questions about programming all the time now, learning a great deal about concepts I never understood or even knew about before. Even if LLM’s reach the point where they can reliably and efficiently write high quality code for complex projects and do everything I need based on simple natural language prompts, I still want to be able to personally verify the work or replicate it independently on my own.</div>

The only thing harder is to actually assist in research

Like maybe the physical sciences Olympiads, but kinda hard for AI to do the labs</div>

But I think we underestimate the potential contributions from AI towards these subjects and many more.


We may feel that a vastly better economic model with much lower inequality, for example, is far away or maybe impossible. But with ever-improving AI involved, we may be much closer than we think.</div>

For example I think it's just as reasonable to say that capitalists using AI will be able to keep the plebs down even easier, making income inequality much higher. I think it's pretty easy to imagine nobody having jobs if an algorithm can do it cheaper. 

I can also imagine what you're saying too. We just don't know.</div>

Our most requested feature just went GA -- Cline now runs natively in all JetBrains IDEs.

We didn't take shortcuts with emulation layers. Instead, we rebuilt with cline-core and gRPC to talk directly to IntelliJ's refactoring engine, PyCharm's debugger, and each IDE's native APIs. It's a true native integration built on a foundation that will enable a CLI (soon) and an SDK (also soon).

Also, anthropic admits it’s limitations all the time

Anthropic research reveals AI models get worse with longer thinking time. https://ground.news/article/anthropic-researchers-discover-the-weird-ai-problem-why-thinking-longer-makes-models-dumber

Anthropic admits its Claude Sonnet 3.7 model cannot run a shop profitably, hallucinates, and is easy to manipulate: https://www.anthropic.com/research/project-vend-1

Side note: Newer LLMs are MUCH better at this than before: https://andonlabs.com/evals/vending-bench

Anthropic also admits its very expensive SOTA Claude Opus 4.1 model underperforms o3 and Gemini 2.5 in multiple benchmarks like GPQA, MMMU, and AIME 2025</div>

These are 2 different statements.

He is correct AI right now is really good at TASKS. The problem is for things that takes humans more than 8 hours, then the AI is not that great.</div>
