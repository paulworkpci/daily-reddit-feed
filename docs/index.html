                                <div class="reply-body">Got downvoted in the o3-pro release thread for calling people stupid for drawing conclusions about agentic planing/multiturn abilities of a model from AIME or other single-turn benchmarks. 

I'll say it again: You guys are fucking stupid.

Our internal benchmarks roughly match OP's result. The jump from o3-pro to latest gemini 2.5 is like from gemini 2.5 to o1. It's quite big actually. (Also it takes like 10-15 times as much money and time). Should be also pretty obvious the second you are using the model that it is quite on another level seeing it takes more time to answer then deepresearch for certain tasks.

You'll see when Aider updates.


**BUT** if you could force Gemini to also run 10 times longer, Gemini probably would be even better. But you currently can't, and I still don’t get why there’s no model yet where you can just define the amount of resources you want it to consume. Or let a specialized model A analyze the problem and figure out the ideal resource budget so model B gets exactly the compute it needs to solve it optimally. You know, like when you read a test and think, “oh shit, I have to think now. giga brain activate!”</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Exactly this. I have these ex-friends from high school who I used to be close with that for the past few years are always blowing me off or leaving my messages unreplied to, even if they initiated the convo. Just been disrespectful in general. I changed my number to avoid them but they somehow found my new number to keep doing the same thing I guess. Instead of allowing them to corrupt me with negativity and resentment, I simply realize that they are this way because they are underdeveloped both mentally and spiritually</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Really well said. It gets really weird especially from the lens of mirror self image where you start noticing it in yourself when you interact with others as well. I try my best to treat everyone with a general respect, I feel like I'm a lot less agitated most days but there are still days where my patience runs thin and I notice myself being short with people. I know I'm at least far less reactive than I used to be. I work in sales so in general I take most things people say with a grain of salt, but sometimes it's hard to switch off that default customer service/sales act with people and act through my true self, even though that act is just being generally respectful, kind and humble which ideally is what we should strive for, no?</div>

It really is unfortunate. I think Trump might honestly be the worst person in the entire world for the American people to have elected on the eve of AI. To thrust that much power onto such an unstable person is bonkers. I wasn't big into the doomer scenarios, but I fully believe if we go down that bad path with AI it will 100% be because of him.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Oh, but the incompetence is so much worse than you’re thinking.  

GitHub is a perfectly secure system for storing private code.  The incompetence is in clicking the wrong button to create a public repo, and not setting up organization level controls to prevent this, and not checking and pushing the code.

Accidentally setting up a public repo is hard to do, but whatever, it happens.  Checking takes literally 5 seconds. Not setting up organization controls, Not checking after setting up, and not checking before you push are so incompetent that I don’t have an analogy.  Maybe leaving the nuclear codes on the counter in McDonald’s.</div>

Humans are a communal and social species; all this shit of social individualism is a scam to make us work harder as part of the machine so we can “be good people” in the eyes of our society that is largely curated by capitalists. It’s been driven into us that if we can’t support ourselves, we are failures, and that idea is fucking deadly to our species. Just because you can work yourself into to an early grave doesn’t mean everyone else is actually happy to do so.</div>

Make one that lies to him and says genocide is happening to white south Africans and refuses to criticize him so he can be happy while the other labs work on intelligence.

The thing with the "smell" is that we don't have the relevant data to feed into these models. It's something that mathematicians develop over countless hours of trial and error, but the problem is in literature, only the final proofs are written down. How we actually came up with the solutions and the entire trial and error process is generally... not written down. Suppose it took a mathematician say 7 years to prove this big theorem, but all you're going to see is the final proof. You don't get to see the hundreds of pages of scrap work that they did over those years, if they're even written down at all. Some stroke of genius may be written down only as messy notes on a napkin from a random cafe one morning. Etc. 

But what's interesting is that the same holds true for the reasoning traces to solve simpler math problems in the first place. Like when you read R1's thoughts and it says it'll try this and that etc. Some parts of those thoughts are eerily human sounding - despite that being a major bottleneck for math just a year ago. Those reasoning traces for humans are never written down, they are either completely in your head, or perhaps verbalized in a class, but never really "written". So there was that big gap in data... yet somehow the models were still able to get something that resembles humans in spite of all that. 

Edit: It's somewhat of a big bottleneck for humans learning math as well. You can have solutions for contest problems but it's not entirely useful for students. They'll read it, maybe even understand it, but are unable to replicate it themselves because the solutions never really go into **how** they thought of them in the first place. Why did they do this step instead of that step, how would one even conceive this solution in the first place, etc etc. You'll have students who upon listening to the solution think that it's so easy and understand once I explain it, but they can't do it themselves at home. Sometimes I try to show my students how to approach some of these problems by doing it completely from scratch and showing just how much of the kitchen sink I'm throwing at it - how I've probably tried 3 different ways that didn't stick and that they never see in the solution key, before finding something promising. 

I think it's conceivable that what Tao is saying could be achieved by these models as an emerging property despite the lack of data on it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You bring up something interesting around being able to train AI on the process rather than the result. The problem is that we can not really simulate or train it on how to think or the process. Which brings up another point - the subconscious. Or system 1/2 as described in the popular book by Daniel Kahneman. It is these nuances and complex interactions that I do not think will simply emerge from scaling. If all it took was LLM to reach ASI, I think most civilizations would be able to. It must be harder than that just from a philosophical stand point. Even tho LLM is a huge break through</div>

&gt;"Some parts of those thoughts are eerily human sounding"

My answer to both of these statements is that LLM's are exactly what we put in them. When scale and amount of data is big enough they get better and better at sounding like the stuff that was put in them.

However what many people on this sub and Terence Tao touch upon is that brilliance that arises when AI goes beyond what humans have generated, like with Alpha go. LLM's as they currently are, are not able to recreate that magic that systems like Alpha Go were able to. The real world does not have clear reward functions that points the LLM towards what a better "move" should be, beyond what it has learned from humans.</div>

In general i don't believe anyone anymore who claims that they have never thought an AI video was real.

No one is any less intelligent for being "fooled" by AI video. 

I think for a lot of "maybe not super bright people" it's an ego thing. "I'm so smart and machines are so dumb, a machine could never fool me. Ha zoom in on that finger and see!"

I'm sure I have seen some first specifically convincing clip at least a year ago that I didn't question if it was real or not. 

And then I was surprised to realize it was AI. Kind of wild how many times I have experienced that already. But mostly with more mundane shorter clips.</div>

You have to earn your license and your conduct with its use proves that you are reasonable to the have the privilege to drive.

Repeatedly endangering the lives of other citizens with reckless driving, excessive speeding, or driving under the influence is entirely fair cause to revoke one's privileges to drive on public roads. 

If they want to retain such privilege, they may elect to have this speed limiter installed. Similar to how one may have a breathalyzer installed on their vehicle after repeated DUI-related offenses.</div>

The smartest thing you can do? Act like it’s a job. Show up. Even if the lecture seems boring or you are running on 3 hours of sleep. Half of success in your first year is just being there. Once you start skipping just one class, it spirals fast. You don’t need to be perfect, just consistent. Trust me, future you will thank you.

                                <div class="reply-body">That’s genuinely correct. I’ve known plenty of idiots who only made it through school because they “tried hard” and the professors didn’t want to fail them. I’ve also known plenty of idiots who absolutely shouldn’t keep their jobs but their bosses don’t want to fire them, and the clients like them even though they’re incompetent. I have a coworker currently (I’m in construction management) and the dude is an absolute idiot, no idea what he’s doing. However he’s always on time, and the clients love him so a lot of missed deadlines get overlooked. If you show up, and people like you, then you’ll be fine. You may not be in the top, but you’ll get by.</div>

Lots of quality of life features that are in a relatively stable state right now (at least the ones I use).

None of the other main competitors offer unlimited slow requests either as far as I know. 

I'm more on the pair programming side of things with focused changes and small scopes as opposed to going all in on sweeping changes with agents and whatnot and for that use case it's still worth the money.</div>

I don’t know if it’s a free offering, but even if it were it would EASILY justify $20/mo.

I just went through a massive refactor of a huge codebase that was especially difficult due to immutable contracts that managed state scattered hundreds of repos, so basically any change of functionality had the potential to completely destroy our production environment.

After getting the architectural patterns defined the tab on its own was spectacular and made it a much less painful endeavor.</div>

Fuck Trump I wouldn't shed a tear if he dropped dead, but  idk why this video is just now blowing up. We tried to warn you about this back in 2018 but half the country didn't listen because "MSNBC bad" or something. He has not been shy about wanting to be a dictator. Idk why some people are just now realizing it.</div>
