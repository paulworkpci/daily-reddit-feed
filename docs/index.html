                                <div class="reply-body">This is why none of this makes any sense. Chrome is literally just a few extra build scripts that pulls down Chromium, adds some Google specific branding, and ships it. Most of the Chromium developers are Google employees, but like, can they keep working on this open source project they've dedicated their lives to? Does Google have to fire all the people they have that work on the open source stuff?

Or.. are they just selling the brand itself? That would maybe be even dumber.</div>

Surprisingly I’ve gotten much deeper lying down with the body scan than upright. I’ve even reached piti sukha (joy/bliss) easily with this measure.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree that refactoring is necessary, but in my experience AI is really bad at refactoring. It needs very close supervision because it has terrible instincts for it, and even then it introduces a lot of new bugs that it can't fix on its own. Refactoring is one of the few areas where the introduction of AI doesn't increase my productivity by much.

Yeah having unit tests will help to avoid silently breaking functionality, but chances are you'll break some of the testing code too and that'll give you more work.

I think just refactoring at the end of every session is not really feasible, you need to dedicate  a bigger portion of your coding time to refactoring when using AI than when coding normally.</div>

Cheers!

ETA: 

As you may know, Brussel Sprouts are one those vegs which produce abundant gas. So, I started "ripping one" during dinner -- pretty often. Mom would then say "How  many times have I told your not to do band practice with your trumpet during dinner?" And I would reply "Me? Do you see a trumpet?  It's in my room."  Then my sister would start "practicing" her "french horn" and dad would join in with his  "trombone".  We had quite the brass trio thing going on there.  Indeed, we finally got things down so well that we could do the theme from Peter Gunn before dessert.

Theme from Peter Gunn for those who don't know:

                        <div class="comment-body">Saw the full 15 min interview. I value his opinions a lot. Him saying that AGI *IS* coming within the next 5 to 10 years with such conviction while saying that best case scenario within 10 years we will be traveling between the stars, curing all diseases etc... makes me rethink my stance. I was of the opinion that it is still far away because I can't see how current technology will lead to AGI.

I would really love to see an interviewer ask him technical questions to see why he thinks we are so close.

Very exciting times.</div>

But like all the scientists have been seeing, with the exponential curve of the systems improving year over year by many magnitudes, it's not hard to come to his conclusion as well.

I'm unsure of the timeline myself, but there are plenty of people saying AI code will be as good as roughly 70% of coders at the end of this year, and near 100% next year. Every week it's harder to doubt the claims of people saying the AI take off will happen by 2027.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's kinda interesting because 12-13 years ago I was sort of a Kurzweil and singularity fan, but ''driverless cars'' did not happen overnight and Siri was also just... Siri... so I sort of left it for sci-fi and moved on. And then ChatGPT happened. And suddenly Kurzweil's 2045 for singularity... it's 20 years in future. Seems like in AI space as it is now 20 years is a very long time. Yes, LLMs still hallucinate and have issues but they have also improved massively in what they can do since early days when ChatGPT wowed public. I don't know about travelling among stars but seems like surely human like robots i.e. ''humanoids'' and autonomous driving should be solved in that time, as well as simple paper pushing jobs... so there will be some kind of paradigm shift. I used to have a job where you could get promoted if you had above average Excel skills that now any LLM can do just like that.

But it's also how when something is hyped we expect results sooner, like with EVs... EU has a mandate to ban any other car sales at 2035 and people see that EVs do not have 100% market share already now and panic about it, but there are 10 years to go and prices have come down and there is more competition and better technology. It will not happen next year or in 3 years or 6, but surely it is not some pie in the sky dream for EVs to be very competitive in 2035.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">What I find funny is that Open AI was set up to counter the ‘evil’ corporate Google and establish a not for profit to create AGI for the benefit of all humanity.

Despite this I feel far more trust for Demis and Google developing AGI than I do for Sam and Open AI developing it. I trust Google more to try to do it responsibly and not chase profit. As the smaller company with much less cash flow Open AI are more likely to be reckless and cut corners on safety</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Altman and Hassabis have very different professional positions. Hassabis does not care about the financial side of the company he works for. He is simply busy with his work, so we see him as sincere and distanced from commercial interests. We see Altman only from a commercial perspective, since he is not a scientist. I think Altman wants a good future for everyone too (he financed the largest study on UBI), but he also strives for the financial growth of his company.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Sam is at least aware of the potential for wide-spread benefits of this technology.  He writes about it very clearly in essays like "Moore's Law for Everything."  However, his actions as the leader of OpenAI are concerning.

Hassabis on the other hand has spent his life solving fundamental problems and giving the solutions away freely to the world.  He doesn't just write essays and then focus on profit.  He's actually doing good in the world and he does it (seemingly) for the satisfaction that it brings him and his good character.  I've said it before, but if Hassabis decides to start a colony somewhere, I'd like to reserve a spot now please.  Even if it means I have to spend my time mopping floors for a while.

Ultimately I think Sam and OpenAI's obsession with "products" will harm them.  When your focus is on profit, that will leave you with less resources for fundamental research.  Some other company with less of a profit motive will be more likely to make a research breakthrough that brings efficient and affordable AGI to the world.</div>

THEY ALL THINK THEY'RE CARLIN! Ok well Shane and Mark don't, but all the comics that went hardcore MAGA and RFK all think they're Carlin. They think they tapped into something special. Look at fucking Ari's response as if he was going to say something. 

These dummies continue to think that because they thought of something clever when they were high as balls, they must be as much of a genius as Carlin. And if they came up to Carlin with this bullshit, he would pat them on the head and tell them what he told Joe DeRosa, "Keep kicking them in the nuts. 

I swear, his "smart" take here is on par with someone going on the show, saying they're an expert in MMA, and that all you need to do is punch someone. Then Rogan says you're full of shit, and you ask Jamie to pull up the McGregor vs Jose Aldo when Colin knocks him out in one punch and yell at Joe, "SEE, ALL YOU NEED IS TO PUNCH!!"</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is a misleading, click-bait title.

o3 now outperforms 94% of expert viologists... on a specific task (troubleshooting wet lab protocols), under pretty ideal conditions that don't require the LLM to actually interact with the messy real world. It appears to be a multiple choice test, and choosing an answer from 4 possibilities is _much_ easier than gathering/putting together information yourself and coming up with some kind of solution or reason for a problem. When you have a multiple choice test, you also know that you have _enough_ information to make a decisive conclusion when in the real world that is often not the case.

We should downvote click-bait titles like this, and ideally the mods should slap people down who post them. There will come a day when this doesn't hold, but for the next good while, any time you see a title like this it is _almost always_ going to be for the reasons I went into here. For example the "OH MY GOD AI IS THE #3 BEST CODER IN THE WORLD!" ... in competitive coding, which is about as unlike real world development as this is to actually working in a lab.

EDIT: So what would be the top sports which makes easy transition to CrossFit? Gymnastic is coming first followed by weightlifting , pole vaulting, swimming, baseball and crosscountry.</div>

Tia was…some kind of college athlete but she also ended up going to the Olympics for weight lifting for Australia (in an uncontested weight class, but still). Rich Froning was a college baseball player. The list goes on and on and on. 

A LOT of the latest crop of athletes GREW UP doing CrossFit, so they didn’t exactly “transition” from other sports.</div>

He played a bit at a juco. Let’s not act like what he was doing comes even close to Mat/Tia. 

Baseball also has almost no crossover with CrossFit. They got rid of the softball throw at the games because it made many of the athletes look foolish (not gonna name the big name athletes that can’t throw for shit)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I want to say “majority” (using this word loosely) or a good chunk has had gymnastic background, weightlifting, or at least did a sport. You look at the top ten Games M/F athlete and I’m willing to bet they got a background in some sport in previous life. I’m convinced if you got gymnastics background you’re made for CF. The methodology pyramid itself has metabolic conditioning and gymnastics just above nutrition so the “ease of entry” for ex-gymnasts would be simple for them. Having that level of understanding and control of the body itself let alone mental fortitude is why they make rig movement easy! My 2 cent…cheers!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;they got a background in some sport in previous life.

Crossfit is their life. Pretty much all the elite athletes from Australia/NZ have been doing it since they were teenagers.

But an elite athlete hasn't just got good by doing wods every day, they do a lot of supplementary training like weights, gymnastics etc.</div>

If university is just job pre-training, it has been a failure long before AI.

Education has far more value than simply job preparation. That's why the rich and powerful go to such lengths to shape and control it to suit their interests (while going to extreme lengths to give their kids the absolute best, broadest education, *even if they never have to work a day in their lives*).</div>

$20 says that what brings us to AGI won't be datasets themselves (no matter the size) but the interconnections and relationships between the datasets, models and agents.

in other words AGI won't be a model or agent it will be a meta-model/meta-agent, analogous to collective consciousness or Gaia.</div>

"
If the right people had been in charge of Nixon’s funeral, his casket would have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. Nixon was so crooked that he needed servants to help him screw his pants on every morning. Even his funeral was illegal. He was queer in the deepest way. His body should have been burned in a trash bin.
"
"
I have had my own bloody relationship with Nixon for many years, but I am not worried about it landing me in hell with him. I have already been there with that bastard, and I am a better person for it.

Money in politics, politicians being bought and paid for! Before Watergate you could only donate 1000.00 max to any one politician. We need to go back to that if they want to save democracy and take our country back.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yup. If there’s one thing virtually all voters agree on the news hates to cover its Citizens United must be reversed. Supreme Court won’t do it. A constitutional amendment can though. Which is why everyone needs to refuse to vote for anyone who won’t cosponsor an amendment reverting the deplorable legalization of unlimited corporate bribery of politicians via Citizens United. Politics and policy is complicated. Citizens United is not. 

How corporations = men, or people, as stated in the First Amendment is an abomination and one of the root causes of today’s disaster that is this once proud and competent nation.</div>

Generally people ignore AI stuff, some of them use it as a work tool like me, and others are using it as a friend, to talk about stuff and what not.

They literally say **"ChatGPT is my friend"** and I was really surprised because they are normal working young people.

But the crazy thing start when a friend told me that his father and big group of people started to say that **"His AI has awoken and now it has free will"**.

It really made me realize how bad most humans are at communicating.

P.S. I learned the word interlocutor by chatting with Claude.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I know what you mean but I think that only applies to such a narrow part of the human experience. Yes it is very good at making a conversation feel worthwhile and compelling, but it has no life experience or opinions. At the end of the day it will always tailor its responses to appease you, losing a fundamental part of conversation. But it’s great to talk about niche shit nobody else cares about, especially in the academic or technical realms. 

But I’m never gonna have a chat about basketball with Claude, because the entire appeal about that sport for me personally is the personal attachments people form. Same thing for video games, or novels. Yes Claude knows how to describe how it feels to play or read, but it doesn’t know it and has never experienced it for itself. At some point it will be able to simulate this perfectly, but I think as humans most of us are more subconsciously motivated than we think and just knowing we aren’t talking to someone who has actually gone through what we have will always be a wall for a lot of people, though not all.</div>
