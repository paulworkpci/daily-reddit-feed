I mean think about it. If our foot gets stuck on something, we can feel it with our skin and adjust our movement accordingly.  
These robots don't have that kid of information because they don't have touch sensors like we do in our skin.
This demo relies purely on input from the gyros and resistance from the motors to navigate their environment.  
This makes it way more impressive. But also explains why it just plows through the objects lol</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I hope they do. Grok is and it's sweeping the huge market no one else is tapping into. When the android version comes out it's going to blow up completely. They kind of need competition, and out of the rest the only one I can see trying to take the piece of that, admittedly creamy, pie would be Meta. Competition is good, we don't really want any of them getting full control of the market.</div>

Imagine if they went one step further and let us interact with AI in VR/AR world using their headset eg. you made a hand gesture, the AI responded back.</div>

It's extremely antisocial behavior, sets up unrealistic expectations for actual human connection, and encourages people to not actually work on themselves because at least they've got this chatbot.

So maybe it will get really big but it's a massive indictment of society.</div>

But, when you think it through, you realize the odds are heavily in their favor so it's better to try to stop it now, even though those odds aren't good either. It shouldn't be happening and that's why the guy becomes so desperate and adrenaline fueled. It comes off as aggression but it's really just shock, dismay, and frustration.</div>

Every time I've won a court case (yes I have had too many to count on two hands) its because my barrister argued in court better than theres or found issues with documentation.

And I learned the hard way by arguing too many times at the point of arrest.</div>

A car you may just need in order to survive in the US. Public transit is nigh on non-existant and with the US being built for drivers, your only other option is to just... starve? Like, those same people who complain about AI are probably also r/fuckcars enjoyers.

Just looking at the arguments against AI, I don't see any complaints about researchers using it for medical breakthroughs or using it to make more efficient use of energy in other sectors. I really only see complaints about people using it for people generating slop content or for manipulating online discourse or harvesting personal data.

This kinda reads like that meme where someone complains about being a peasant and someone pops out of the well and says, "yet you participate in society!"

Any coder with any experience will tell you that lines of code written is a meaningless statistic, and it is effectively the same statistic being used to suggest that AI is seeing widespread impactful adoption.</div>

It is a sign that indeed boilerplate code is almost being written by AI now.

If an org has &gt;50% lines of code written by AI, that is a very interesting thing to know about and am sure has some correlation with needing or not needing junior devs. Obviously, shouldn’t be the only thing and there are better metrics but this isn’t meaningless imo.</div>

I'm not so sure about that. I have noticed my programming quality slipping as my AI usage increases. It's definitely something that any professional will need to manage on top of their usage, you can't just expect that information to be absorbed automatically. 

With that being said, it may not be *necessary* for everyone to know how current low-level code works in the future. Just as I don't need to know machine code to use Javascript, there may be a future for devs who basically can't program in the traditional sense.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">it appears to be counter-intuitive but apparently, according to this study anyway...

&gt;When developers are allowed to use AI tools, they take 19% longer to complete issues—a significant slowdown that goes against developer beliefs and expert forecasts. This gap between perception and reality is striking: developers expected AI to speed them up by 24%, and even after experiencing the slowdown, they still believed AI had sped them up by 20%.

When you put it that way, it sounds far from useless: It's just another iteration in how we do software development. We're always chasing ["13. Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time."](https://cscie2x.dce.harvard.edu/hw/ch01s06.html)

In the PC world, for example, machine code was wrapped by Assembly Language was wrapped by DMA languages such as C. Each iteration sacrificed precision for ease and better results.

We developed libraries of reusable code along the way and folded them in with language-specific IDEs for languages like Pascal and Visual Basic, which rescued thousands of troubleshooting hours spent tracking down pointer reference errors.

Fast forward to the day before yesterday, and we have integrated IDEs, automated testing, nearly transparent cross-language support, and a catalog of available code so vast that nearly every Lego brick you could desire is out there for free on someone's GitHub repo.

Now we'll have the LLMs building the bricks building the libraries. Today's young agents will improve, eventually delivering bespoke applications about as quickly as a need is identified. Five nines of programmer time preserved.

edit to add: All of which is to say, I think you're right. By the time we'd need the juniors to know something, we really won't anymore.</div>

The guy asked me what's the lowest complexity for the sorting algorithm and I confidently answered `O(n)` and he's like "what, no obviously it's O(nlog(n)). There's a _proof_ that comparative sorting can't be lower than O(n*log(n))". I pointed out that he never said _comparative_ and bucket or radix sorts exist. 

He went on 5 minute rant that those do not count because they are not "general" and kinda acted like I was not supposed to know about them, as if they were some well guarded secret only best programmers at google knew.</div>

The prompter gave an early version of the paper to GPT-5. 

&gt; Its core idea is similar to that of the original paper, which is to transform the convexity problem of the optimization curve into proving the decreasing of the function value decrease.

The technique it used was basically the same as the original paper, and if it used web search it would have access to the updated paper.

I think seeing lots of complex math symbols is super intimidating, but really it's just about putting in an ungodly amount of time working on really boring stuff to build up the context on how to do this stuff (I studied math as my undergrad, forgot like 95% of it at this point).

These types of findings make people feel really excited, but at the same time when I give it basic instructions to implement a software feature and it turns an or condition into an and condition because it doesn't understand what was asked, I mean come on it's just not that smart</div>

For me GPT-5 High does a shit ton more thinking and tool calling but only arrives at the same or slightly less operational answer than Gemini. I think it’s better for complex thinking and planning but doesn’t really implement changes very reliably.</div>

The regulatory hurdles alone will stop AI from replacing human doctors for quite some time, and I think it is borderline dangerous to tell people not to become doctors given the ballooning population of elderly people.</div>

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01328-w

This meta-analysis evaluates the impact of human-AI collaboration on image interpretation workload. Four databases were searched for studies comparing reading time or quantity for image-based disease detection before and after AI integration. The Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy was modified to assess risk of bias. Workload reduction and relative diagnostic performance were pooled using random-effects model. Thirty-six studies were included. AI concurrent assistance reduced reading time by 27.20% (95% confidence interval, 18.22%–36.18%). The reading quantity decreased by 44.47% (40.68%–48.26%) and 61.72% (47.92%–75.52%) when AI served as the second reader and pre-screening, respectively. Overall relative sensitivity and specificity are 1.12 (1.09, 1.14) and 1.00 (1.00, 1.01), respectively. Despite these promising results, caution is warranted due to significant heterogeneity and uneven study quality.

A.I. Chatbots Defeated Doctors at Diagnosing Illness. "A small study found ChatGPT outdid human physicians when assessing medical case histories, even when those doctors were using a chatbot.": https://archive.is/xO4Sn

“The median diagnostic accuracy for the docs using ChatGPT Plus was 76.3%, while the results for the physicians using conventional approaches was 73.7%. The ChatGPT group members reached their diagnoses slightly more quickly overall -- 519 seconds compared with 565 seconds." https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/11/241113123419.htm

- This study was done in October of 2024, and at that time, the only reasoning model that was available was o1 mini and preview. I'm not sure what model they used for the study as they only say ChatGPT Plus but its safe to assume that had they done the same study today with the o3 model, we would see an even larger improvement in those metrics.</div>

One thing that helped me a ton was drilling them once a week at first. With the multi-step kipping patterns, reinforcement helps a ton with muscle memory. Doesn't have to be much, maybe some kipping swings, hips to bar, and a few singles. 


Lots of people say this, but it's very true. Consistency is critical to breaking that "do I have them today?" curse. </div>

Right now, the 6 of Anthropic's models are all in the top 10. In my experience, I haven't found GPT-5 to be clearly better at frontend tasks then Sonnet 4 or I've found it to be personally worse than Opus.

Disclaimer: i am experimenting 

But there was an issue with the code, and i experimented with 4 different models 

Soonset 3.5, Soonset 3.7 and GPT 5 Preview kept going in loops fixing the issue with no results 

Soonset 4 lastly introduced to the code and everything was fixed in the first attempt 

And yes I totally agree, when I made ChatGPT write the prompts for Soonset 4 .. well let's just say I was blown away by the results 

Are AI agents perfect? Of course not 

But that doesn't mean they are not getting there 

I am close to finishing up a tool that has an algorithm and a logical flow in 5 days and I don't have any experience with coding. But, I can understand the language a bit and I certainly can help agents pinpoint the problems and how they should fix it and they do fix it. 

If their "AI agents" progress kept on the same track, they will reach perfection within 5 years conservatively I suspect 

From your experience, what do you think? Will they ever reach perfection? When?</div>

I honestly get terrible results from opus 4.1 and I know it is user error. I am a software engineer by trade so I get technical and it still barfs or does not understand. 

However GPT-5 thinking seems to understand my prompt language much better and the code from it is decent. I also have no issues with opus 4 and sonnet. Opus 4.1 I just burn tokens (by restarting tasks that it/I messed up). </div>
