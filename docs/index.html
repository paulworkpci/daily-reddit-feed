My lifts are pretty solid, cardio isn't terrible, but double unders? I swear to god these things haunt me. Like I can string together maybe 10-15 on a good day but the second they show up in a WOD my brain just shuts down. 

I've watched all the videos, practiced before class, tried different ropes, but I think at this point its more in my head than anything else. The worst part is watching brand n...</div>

I know it sounds silly, there are many exercises that are much harder/technical, but that's it for me. I've always been very uncoordinated in sports with a ball, and the fact that this one's weighted doesn't make it any different. 

I suck at them, I get hit on the nose 1/3 times and I often go either too high or too low and miss the target.

I don't think it's ever going to click for me. Sigh.</div>

They quit bosses.

Could I make a lot more money if I were to change companies? 

Absolutely.

Why don't I? I'm being paid an incredible salary for the amount of work I have to do. 

35-hour work week, little to no stress, generous PTO, sick pay, and healthcare benefits.

What keeps me is that my current management makes sure I'm taken care of, treats me as an adult, and supports me whenever I need assistance or help. 

I've been at my current job for 10 years, and I don't think I'm going to leave unless they force me out.</div>

&gt; They quit bosses.

This has never been true as a blanket statement. I've seen so many people who've quit because, while they had a great relationship with their boss and team, the company didn't value them enough (low raises, no promotion, enforcing stupid mandates like having to work from office 5 days a week) that they left for greener pastures. 

All I'm saying is that if you're a boss and you try your best to look after your people, don't take it too personally when they quit :)</div>

Well, that and the incredible salary you mentioned, I would imagine.

I hear what you're saying, but let's be real. Workers do not just quit bosses. You being able to make more elsewhere isn't the huge draw it perhaps once was (and might be for many) largely because that need is being met to your satisfaction. If you had that same 35 hour work week, little to no stress, generous PTO sick pay and healthcare benefits, but you were paid $15/hr instead of whatever you make, I suspect you'd be a lot more open to quitting, great boss or not.</div>

This is absolutely not the case in reality.

People change careers for all kinds of reasons apart from because they have a boss that sucks.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm no Musk dickrider by any means, but when my neighborhood was trashed after hurricane's Helene and Milton last year, him giving free Starlink to those in affected areas likely saved my job and I don't say that lightly.

I'll spare the details, but suffice it to say, I had a massive project nearing completion around the time the hurricanes came.  I ended up without power+internet for 15 very consequential days.  My company is headquartered elsewhere and I was the only employee affected by the hurricanes, so despite the circumstances, I probably wasn't going to be given much grace if I was unable to get online and ensure the project finished on time.

Because of the Starlink offer, I was able to get back online within a couple days after the hurricane.  I had neighbors coming by for weeks using the connection to also do their work, fill prescriptions, file FEMA paperwork, etc etc.

A couple of other neighbors ended up taking advantage of the offer as well.  Something about living close enough to the Space Coast to watch these Starlinks get launched every other night and then seeing how they directly benefitted me was pretty inspiring to say the least.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm glad that it helped you, but putting my cynic hat on it seems like a standard case of cash burn in a startup to gain goodwill, act as an advertisement, and/or build the reputation of the company in its early growth phase. It's not to downplay the good that giving free internet does for people who were ravaged by a storm. That's a real thing and it's a good side effect that comes out of it.

But I have serious doubts he'd do the same thing with a mature company that's done growing and I also doubt he'd do it without getting something out of it (like the examples I mentioned e.g. goodwill, tax breaks). Your tragedy happened to line up with his interests to become an opportunity for him and his investors.

The way we incentivize donation through the tax code is by giving a financial benefit to the donor via tax relief. Outside of that, donations are generally an investment in goodwill and/or brand building. For guys like this, nearly everything is transactional.

If he did acts like this out of sheer benevolence only, the least he could do is stop trying to force his employees to not be able to have the freedom of association and freedom of expression to be part of a worker's union seeking fair compensation for their work. These are people that literally work for him and produce the value that underpins the valuation of the companies that constitute the vast majority of his net worth, yet he fights pretty hard to stop them being able to advocate for themselves from anything but a position of division and weakness. Allowing grace there for workers would not produce a return on the "investment" of paying slightly higher labor costs to be in line with the industry. It would be entirely benevolent to allow this, and that's precisely why it can't happen. There's nothing in it for him, and the "charity" of paying his staff closer to a fair salary and benefits would never show up in the balance sheet at a later date in a way that increases the company's equity valuation. No one will give praise or hand him awards for paying slightly closer to a fair compensation for the work they do and the value they produce for him.

Whereas, with free internet for storm victims, it makes for a good story and clearly has done some job at spreading the good word about his company (as we are doing here) which adds to the company's goodwill, brand recognition, etc. which results in the long term with a positive return on the "investment" of providing that free service for a few days.</div>

In 2021, he donated $5.7 billion in Tesla shares to the foundation, making it one of the largest charities in the US.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;Both the selection of recipients of donations and a relatively low payout ratio have been criticized. In 2021 and 2022, the Musk Foundation awarded less than 5% of its assets in donations, after its assets grew to several billion dollars. This means that it fell short of the legal minimum donation required to maintain its tax-exempt status. The Guardian criticized the fact that the foundation financed various projects of Musk and his family members, although this is not unusual for billionaires and wealthy donors. The New York Times concluded that through 2022, about half of the Musk Foundation's grants went to organizations "tied" to Musk, one of his employees, or one of his companies.
&gt;
&gt;On December 12, 2024, The New York Times reported the foundation again awarded less than 5% of its assets in donations in 2024.</div>

But if the film had been released in 2025, how do you think people would react?

Considering the things that are happening right now, I feel like people would find it plausible, and there would be a lot of debate about this topic compared to what we're currently seeing.

Which makes it odd that they want Trump to run in 2028, it’ll be hard to claim a strong economy when the country is so obviously reeling. They really will need to rely on the whole “the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears” thing they’ve been trying lately.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Wow, wheels are so useful!

I still remember a decade or so ago when a friends car broke down so I told them to put it in neutral and steer while I pushed it off the road. They didn't believe it could be done. A minute later, they believed.

Wheels are amazing things.

To be fair, though, while I do weigh somewhat more than 35kg, the road wasn't as flat as a billiard table like in this example.

Impressive, though, regardless. That's a well programmed robot!</div>

The manager allegedly shut a car door on a feds leg, and the photos show a scrape-type of boo boo. So yes, he's getting charged with a felony as one should expect.

  
Doctors and nurses are recommending the maximum sentence, saying this is a serious boo-boo and may require a prescription of 3 kisses from mommy before bed.</div>

- makes you appear (and become) more engaged
- establishes a confident physical demeanor
- helps maintain healthy back posture

That’s how I learned till eventually it became second nature and I sat confidently, no lasers required!

Edit: For those worried about laser-ing someone by accident, be sure your company has an AD&amp;D insurance policy before trying this method.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hey Guys,  
Had chronic back pain for 3 years. Tried everything - stretching, core work, YouTube exercises. Nothing worked. Finally saw a physio. 15 minutes in: "Your back isn't the problem. Your hips are too tight. Your back is compensating."

Yep, clinical validation is next, already in talks with Sports University Cologne for proper testing.
 
Wanted to nail the UX first though, even the best validated tool is useless if people don't actually use it 😄

I like alot of what they are doing, however the gauge will be the balance between mistakes and cost effectiveness. Right now 55% as the highest benchmark isn't good enough, but I think in 2026.. if it starts hitting 70/75% for junior roles... you'll see alot of people displaced.</div>

thought AI would save me. everyone says AI is revolutionizing code review right? spent a month testing copilot, claude, and verdent. spent $400-500/month on subscriptions.

result? saved 30 mins per day. thats it.

let me break down why this is a terrible ROI.

copilot - finds unused variables and basic stuff. surface level.

                        <div class="comment-body">tech lead here. this is painfully accurate

the "AI approved a PR that solved the wrong problem" story hit home. had almost the exact same thing happen last month. dev built a perfect solution to a problem we didnt have. AI said it looked great

the confidence problem you mentioned is huge. AI flags "potential null pointer" with the same urgency as "this will cause data corruption in production". you still have to use your brain for every single suggestion

where i disagree: i think 30 mins/day is actually pretty good? thats 2.5 hours a week. over a year thats like 120 hours saved. not revolutionary but not nothing

what worked for us: stopped using AI for actual code review. now we use it as a pre-review linter. devs run their code through AI, fix the obvious stuff, THEN submit for human review. cuts down on the "you forgot to handle the error case" back and forth

also set a rule: if AI flags something, dev has to understand WHY before fixing it. stops the lazy "just do what AI says" behavior

the junior dev training benefit is real though. our newest dev improved way faster because AI catches stuff immediately instead of waiting for PR review

tldr: AI code review is oversold but if you use it as a teaching tool + fancy linter its worth keeping</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">this is actually really helpful. the "pre-review linter" approach makes way more sense than what im doing

right now im running AI review in parallel with my review. your workflow of devs running it BEFORE submitting is smarter. catches obvious stuff earlier

the rule about understanding WHY before fixing is solid. gonna steal that

youre probably right about 30 mins/day. 120 hours/year sounds better. maybe im just frustrated because i expected more based on the hype

how do you enforce the pre-review step? team culture or PR template? and which tool did you settle on?</div>

We’ve just established a team norm that copilot should be an assigned  reviewer and all of its comments addressed before the dev reaches out to the team for review.

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm curious, the "solving the wrong problem" thing, do you let the AI read the issue and try and evaluate whether PR fulfils it correctly?
We're not doing that yet so I can't tell how well it'll work, but it's something worth considering. Claude review tool can be setup to use MCP and you can probably connect it to the issue.

I expect it might catch PR/issue divergence maybe 20% of the time, but honestly how often can human reviewers really spot it themselves?

PS: it's worth prompting the system to be concise and only report things that are guaranteed to be problematic. Or allow it to fix nits (something we're considering, as optional action right in the review)</div>
