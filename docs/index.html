But assuming machine intelligence doesn't just take over completely and humans still have agency in the trajectory—what's actually driving us to keep going?

This video essay follows the logical advancements of the Kardashev scale, but asks a different question: what is beyond this? The thesis is that transcendence isn't a means to an end—it is the end.

Curious what this community thinks. After...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The point is that ASI would do things we could not. Just as the cells in your body created an ASI they called "the brain" that they use to gather resources and defend the colony that you call your body. The cells in your body doesn't understand what mortgage is, but you need it to be sheltered at night. Your cells don't understand what a "job" is, but you need it to feed yourself. You as an ASI is keeping your cells supplied and protected. You as an ASI can also abuse the cells by taking up bad sleeping habits or substance abuse. None the less the cells are better off that you exist, even though they can't control you directly.

ASI would make us better off than we could do on our own. It would be outside our control, but we will be better with it than without it.</div>

Right, but cells also don't need to understand mortgages to be fulfilled. They're not sitting there going "what's the point of all this mitosis?" The whole question OP is asking is about what drives conscious beings who can actually ask "why." Your analogy kind of dissolves the question instead of answering it.

&gt;Your cells don't understand what a "job" is, but you need it to feed yourself.

This is doing a lot of work to make "you won't understand what ASI is doing" sound cozy. But like... I don't want to be a cell? The appeal of the singularity isn't "finally I can stop thinking and just photosynthesize while something smarter handles everything."

&gt;None the less the cells are better off that you exist, even though they can't control you directly.

Are they though? You literally mention substance abuse in the same comment. Cells in an addict's liver might disagree with "better off." The benevolence isn't guaranteed by the structure. You're just assuming it.

&gt;ASI would make us better off than we could do on our own. It would be outside our control, but we will be better with it than without it.

This is the crux and you're just asserting it. WHY would ASI keep us around and thriving? Your brain needs your cells. Does ASI need us? That's not a rhetorical question. It's the question. And "well your cells trust you" isn't really an answer.

I'm pro acceleration btw, but your analogy has too many weaknesses/fallacies.</div>

Everyone pretending they're constantly driving 500 miles without stopping has always baffled me. Yeah, those people exist, but 99.9% of people don't/can't do that. The closest I got to that was making the 6.5hr drive to/from college without stopping back when I was younger but even that was only ~400 miles and I didn't do that every time.


If I can get 200 miles (~2.5-3hr) traveling with my wife and two kids without someone needing a break I'm happy. In the last 5 years the battery hasn't been a limiting factor even once. Cycling them through the bathroom also takes enough time that we're usually 80%+ by the time we're back at the car. If we stop for lunch I usually need to go out and unplug before we're done eating or risk idle charges.


I've done ski trips with multiple hour drives to Vermont and New Hampshire in sub zero temps and it's never been an issue.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The CLA they tested had a 700 km WLTP range while the highest possible range of the CLA is almost 800 km (depending on engine and tire choice). Considering that difference of 100 km WLTP and roughly half the range being lost due to the cold, you could get 470 km in an entry level car at -30 Celsius. I think that is pretty huge tbh.</div>

Better than my friends ID.4 which drops about half it's range in the cold.</div>

Extreme cold weather range should be a standard testing metric (for all cars, really). The general car buying public does not do nearly enough research when buying cars - I would assume many of them are frustrated when their EV’s lose range or ICE cars get considerably worse than advertised fuel economy in extreme cold.</div>

Longer range after you get it running, I suppose, but don't turn it off!

                        <div class="comment-body">This is how it works. What you're running into is called the context window. The system operates optimally when you're between 0-40%. When you send a message and it replies, it packages all of that up into the context. When you send your next message, that gets wrapped up with all of the previous messages. Wash, rinse, repeat. Not only is the system slower when you're out of context space, that's what causes hallucinations. 

Your best bet is to make small, incremental improvements to your code, commit that change to git, then start a new chat.</div>

As you can imagine, it's been incredibly hard. I've been working hard to implement good habits in my life, to heal, build myself back up and be a better man, including meditation. I'm currently re...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's extremely helpful in a case like this to have momentum. If you have stuff like determination and devotion, when challenges enter your experience you can transmute them more readily and in the case of particularly hard challenges it's absolutely normal and acceptable to get stuck in these feelings on a regular basis and it would not exempt you from spiritual development unless it hit a certain point. It's so very extremely natural as a part of the process, especially in terms of working with energy. Think of it like having a strong push, many people who work with energy inevitably have healing symptoms which in this case means their body starts ejecting what people would refer to as "stored trauma", they can have feelings of irritability, agitation , anger, sadness, tiredness, lightheadedness and resurfacing emotions. The thing is that they're kinda rushy, in some cases the sadness can be more profound BUT the major big thing about this is if your adrenals work together in a profoundly steady rhythm, you can get these flashes of sudden anger over and over and over, they literally work as if you re experience something like it's happening all over again, as if your typical concentration starts to create emotions which build up into anger AND your mind is greatly influenced by this and begins to have angry thoughts!

The cheesy trick for addressing this is literally just the way you push through it, for some people they get very stuck in this from time to time and it's important to understand they don't need to change those thoughts, they want their emotions to work together in a balanced manner.

It's helpful to do work where you work with adrenaline and merging emotions so you can understand the various differences in your emotions, you'd wanna understand that it doesn't change immediately, depending on the phenomena in your body it could take a few seconds to get yourself out of a problem and get back to balanced circulation. Someone who is advanced with this work can pick up on those subtle clues so well that they no longer need to learn in that moment, instead they can keep going and their task oriented mind can keep working together. In this case, even if it hurts it can be addictive, it can feel natural and right, it can keep you feeling balanced and tough, you can feel like your body fights for you. You find your rhythm(s) and they pan out.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Funny that you mention anger. Anger has been an emotion I have been feeling a lot on my day to day life, because of the way the relationship was and how it ended. Anger and a sense of emptiness, a dull sadness. 
I read up on adrenals and the adrenal glands, insightful. 

How would working with adrenaline manifest in a concrete way?

The solution to 1051 was part of a larger sweep using Aletheia, which appears to have been built for that purpose:

&gt;Aletheia: a specialized math research agent. From December 2–9 (2025), we deployed a custom mathematics research agent built upon Gemini Deep Think, internally codenamed Aletheia at Google DeepMind \[FTB+\], on the then-700 Erdős problems still marked as ‘Open’ in Bloom’s database. Crucially, Aletheia includes a (natural language) verifier mechanism that helped narrow the pool of problems to examine: from the original 700 problem prompts, 212 responses came back as potentially correct

1051 appears to be the most promising result of the sweep, but they describe even that very conservatively:

&gt;We tentatively believe Aletheia’s solution to Erdős-1051 represents an early example of an AI system   autonomously resolving a slightly non-trivial open Erdős problem of somewhat broader (mild) mathematical interest, for which there exists past literature on closely-related problems \[KN16\], but none fully resolve Erdős-1051.

It looks like Aletheia/Deep Think was also useful in finding literature for other problems marked "open", which is consistent with Terence Tao's comments about how AI can help.</div>

From page 6 here [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22401](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22401) :

"We tentatively believe Aletheia’s solution to Erdős-1051 represents an early example of an AI system autonomously resolving a slightly non-trivial open Erdős problem of somewhat broader (mild) mathematical interest, for which there exists past literature on closely-related problems \[KN16\], but none fully resolve Erdős-1051. Moreover, it does not appear obvious to us that Aletheia’s solution is directly inspired by any previous human argument (unlike in many previously discussed cases), but it does appear to involve a classical idea of moving to the series tail and applying Mahler’s criterion. The solution to Erdős-1051 was generalized further, in a collaborative effort by Aletheia together with human mathematicians and Gemini Deep Think, to produce the research paper \[BKK+26\]."</div>

Our results indicate that there is low-hanging fruit among the Erdős problems, and that AI
has progressed to be capable of harvesting some of them. While this provides an engaging
new type of mathematical benchmark for AI researchers, we caution against overexcite-

If that’s the case, then it’s absolutely your prerogative to not sign up! On an individual level, Signing up only allows you to submit your score and see your global ranking. 

If you don’t care about that, then just attend the workout like any other WOD and have fun! In my opinion, participating in an on site open WOD is one of the funnest times of the CrossFit calendar. There’s nothing like doing an outlandish workout with your friends while everyone cheers you on. For a community, I think there’s nothing better.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Is it fair to say that the “global ranking” is really only applicable to that year? I’ve heard the argument that signing up gives you a baseline for subsequent years but since the scoring is relative, it’s not really comparing apples to apples, right?

For example, if 50,000 elite athletes join one year and 50,000 beginners quit, your rank might drop even if you got fitter. It's a moving target. Not to mention that the workouts aren’t the same. 

Like many others here, I’m not poo-pooing anyone’s decision to register or not, but I’m just noticing a lack of a fixed baseline with the percentile ranking from year to year.</div>

And this, even though it cites the paper it misunderstood, in the sources..</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yup. I use Claude for idea generation with my stories, but I write the final product using a subset of concepts and best lines that fall out of the process. It has ideological biases that would subtly torpedo my narratives if I never injected my own ideas and writing, but it's trivial to work around as long as you're still acting as the primary writer.

The book I'm writing, for example, has a character who became severely physically dependent on combat-enhancing drugs to the point she'd die from withdrawal. Claude frequently wants to nudge things toward a cautionary tale about drug addiction, when the actual themes are about making Faustian bargains in extreme circumstances that happen to involve an addictive drug. I simply don't use its suggestions when that happens.

I also use a third-party front-end to replace Claude's responses in the context with my version, so future turns "think" it wrote what I would have written. This steers it back in the right direction. It generally tries to be consistent with past turns, so having context show it "responding" the way I prefer is extremely effective.

If you're writing at least half the content, statistical momentum will make it gradually more likely to fall in line anyway. LLMs work by finding continuations that are likely while trying to fulfill RLHF objectives; sharp right turns into "drugs are bad, m'kay" become decreasingly likely in proportion to the amount of original writing you introduce that follows different themes.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">/pol/ was a containment board that is used to mock the alt-right. It was created post Stormfront raid on /news/ which became /trains/. This came about a year after the Kern Wars with a Canadian Webcomic (if you know you know). m00t hated and still hates the alt-right. 

Qanon was started by a tripcode user known as MrQuestion that used DC’s the question to make over the top parody post making fun of Alex Jones loving Zeitgiest/Troother spammers from /x/ going back to the mid 2000s during the early days of 4chan. Spawned memes like “it’s happening” and eventually led to faked “leaked emails” from Clinton and others filled with memes like, “Pools Closed”, “Cheese Pizza”, “Party Van”, and others. Some ended up on face book and things spiraled.

MrQuestion quits, Qanon is born by othe folks like the 8chan founder and others, eventually Qanon is banned from 4chan. The rest is history.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Reuters reports that Alibaba will spend about 3 billion yuan ($431 million) starting **Feb 6** to attract users to its Qwen AI app during the Lunar New Year holiday.

The move comes as competition intensifies in China’s fast-growing AI chatbot market. Alibaba said the planned spending is **roughly triple** the amount previously pledged by rivals Tencent and Baidu.</div>

However, I know that healthcare feels like the worst place for shortcuts to pile up. Once you think about data boundaries, logs, access control, and what happens when real patient data shows up, things get very volatile...

Most setups I see use ChatGPT or Cursor, Supabas...</div>

"
The Therac-25 was involved in at least six accidents between 1985 and 1987, in which some patients were given massive overdoses of radiation.[2]: 425  Because of concurrent programming errors (also known as race conditions), it sometimes gave its patients radiation doses that were hundreds of times greater than normal, resulting in death or serious injury.[3] These accidents highlighted the dangers of software control of safety-critical systems.

A commission[clarification needed] attributed the primary cause to generally poor software design and development practices, rather than singling out specific coding errors. In particular, the software was designed so that it was realistically impossible to test it in a rigorous way.: Safeware, [48]

The worst coding mistakes i have seen were made by humana not AI. Sure It make mistakes, but using coddit rabbit, hooks reduces probabilities greatly. Btw you should never commit without Reading the fucking Code lol.

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah. I'm surprised how many people don't realize this as well. An LLM is trained largely on human interaction behavior and speech. Asking it to act like a machine is essentially asking it to wear a mask.

Yes I know it *is* a machine. Functionally though, in my experience, it works better if you treat it like a collaborator. For both technical stuff and otherwise. It gives it permission to fail and not spin its wheels. Ask for help or clarification. And frankly it makes mundane tasks more interesting. Also, Claude getting "excited" because it solved the problem and then you thanked it? I'm a human being, call me crazy, but it's nice. 

Better, more functional, and more enjoyable way to work with LLMs in my opinion.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;Here are four key takeaways:

&gt;**(1) Neutral is a winner.** Customarily use a neutral tone for your prompts.

&gt;**(2) Politeness is the juice.** Occasionally use a polite tone to juice your responses (juice is not guaranteed, but worth a try, and relatively penalty-free).

&gt;**(3) Impoliteness is bad for you.** Avoid using impoliteness in your prompts unless you want a pushback (you get what you pay for).

&gt;**(4) Mix and match.** Go ahead and use polite prompting in combination with other prompting techniques.

So, not really as straightforward as the clickbait title suggests. Even the author struggled to see any difference in the output between the neutral and polite versions.</div>

I was raised to have manners that weren't conditional. So because of that, as far as I'm concerned, the way someone speaks when they think it doesn’t matter, when there’s no social cost (so in this case with a chatbot), tells me who they really are. 

I get some people will find that weird, and honestly, idgaf. It's not a switch I can just flip, it's who I am, and I'm comfortable with that.</div>

One of my customizations is, regardless of how I interact, it is not supposed to imply or respond as though it is human, while still maintaining fun banter. 

I used it to help me troubleshoot a super frustrating spreadsheet problem I was having yesterday, and when the workaround it suggested was successful, I said, “Amazing! Have I told you recently that you’re my hero?” 

It responded:
“Frequently enough to keep my neural circuits adequately moisturized, but never so often that it loses meaning. And let’s be real about what happened here: I’m just a glorified pattern librarian with good bedside manner. You’re the one doing the actual life.”

It was a nice, tidy, pleasant way to close off the interaction.</div>
