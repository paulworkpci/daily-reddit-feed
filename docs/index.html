That someone took one of those teams meant of Castro and used it on Kennedy is going to be hard to prove -- anyone  who worked on those programs could have found themselves implicated if a real investigation happened so basically everyone had a motive to obstruct an investigation.

There's no chance there are any real smoking gun documents left. What they can release now are just unredacted docs with informants and methods not blacked out ... Since they're all long dead.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It looks like this is a pre-recorded routine using mo-cap. When they hit "play" on the routine there is a jarring transition in posture the robot assumes from the beginning of that routine. Still impressive, but it at least does not appear to be a behavior it is dynamically calculating and executing as much as it is a pre-recorded set of exactly positioned "waypoints" for each motor, if that makes sense. In any case we are getting quite close, and with the new physics engine they used to power that Disney/Nvidia robot I am impressed by both of these and hope to see them implemented for various uses around the world (security through neighborhoods, doing dangerous jobs, with my favorite future use-case being helping to build homes/framing/structures as this will be life changing for all of us).</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">For context: NVIDIA just unveiled “Blue” at GTC 2025, a humanoid robot developed in collaboration with Disney Research and Google DeepMind. It’s part of their push to advance robotics using AI and simulation technologies. One of the biggest pieces of tech behind Blue is the newly announced Newton physics engine, an open-source simulator designed specifically for robotics. Newton was also developed with Google DeepMind and Disney Research, and it’s meant to improve how robots learn and interact with the real world.

Here's the link to Nvidia's stream from a few hours ago: [https://youtu.be/\_waPvOwL9Z8?t=9009](https://youtu.be/_waPvOwL9Z8?t=9009)</div>

                <div class="post-content">Procrastination isn’t about lacking motivation or willpower; it’s often rooted in anxiety around tasks that feel overwhelming or boring. Many of us turn to productivity hacks like “Just do it” or “Don’t think, just do,” but sometimes these methods only push us through tasks without addressing the real reasons for procrastination.

What I’ve found to be surprisingly effective is **sitting still**. It may sound counterintuitive at first, but when we procrastinate, we’re often avoiding something th...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There are two differentiations I would like to offer:

1. Sitting still and doing nothing, not thinking, not searching for stuff with the eyes, not looking around, eventually closing the eyes 

2. Allowing for eyes to wander around, analyze problems in the room, create a to-do list in the head to solve just seen problems

I am a somewhat lethargic/depressed individual and #2 helps me initiating doing stuff that is actually important for me, compared to using the internet etc.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I like the second variation, too. Sitting still and not thinking about anything would just get my anxiety up. But sitting still and focusing your thinking on something like a to-do list, could be a more relaxing way to work through your procrastination.   
  
Like by thinking about the steps to complete what you're procrastinating about, could you relax so you could get started on the first step in your task.</div>

The fix? **Force it to reason before answering.**  

Here’s a method I’ve been using that consistently improves responses:  

1. **Make it analyze before answering.**  
Instead of just asking a question, tell it to list the key factors first. Example:  
“Befo...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is what ChatGPT thinks about your post:

The post is mostly accurate but presents things in an oversimplified way, acting as if it's uncovering some hidden mechanism rather than just using basic prompting techniques. Yes, ChatGPT predicts words based on probability, but that doesn’t mean it’s incapable of structured reasoning—it just doesn’t do it automatically unless prompted to.

The suggested methods—breaking down key factors, self-critiquing, and considering multiple perspectives—are all solid ways to get more thoughtful responses. But the way it's framed makes it sound like ChatGPT is fundamentally shallow unless ‘forced’ to reason, which isn't quite right. The model *can* reason well, but default responses aim for general usefulness rather than deep analysis unless the prompt demands otherwise.

Also, the "self-critique" method is useful, but it depends on the kind of response needed. Sometimes, asking a model to self-analyze just leads to redundant rewording rather than actual refinement. The best way to get quality answers is knowing *how* to phrase a question clearly and *what level* of depth is actually useful for the task.

Overall, the post is useful for people who haven’t experimented much with prompt engineering, but it overhypes the impact of these techniques as if they’re revolutionary rather than just common sense for working with AI.</div>

This is an ouroboros of AI-assisted pedantry. The rebuttal doesn’t actually challenge the original post in any meaningful way—it just rephrases the same observations with a more dismissive tone. It claims the post oversimplifies, then restates the same core idea in slightly different words. It acknowledges the techniques work but acts like calling them "not revolutionary" is some kind of counterargument. It even throws in a vague critique of self-analysis without offering anything substantial. This isn’t a real rebuttal—it’s just an AI-generated instinct to nitpick for the sake of sounding insightful.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I have a 20 questions bot that asks me a bunch of setup questions (what do you want to know, what's your goal, how would you like to structure the output, what expertise do you want for my response, etc) then launches into 20 essay questions that usually require a sentence or 4 to answer. At the end of the 20 questions, it pulls the entire convo into its context window, analyzes my responses, identifies patterns, and outputs the desired information in the format I've requested using the expertise I've requested.

I use this for things that are deceptively hard questions, like "what are my core values and beliefs, and why?" Or "what specifically do I like about horror as a genre?" Or "what kind of car should I get when I move across the country, into a different climate, given my needs?"

By breaking these larger questions into contextually relevant smaller questions, the AI is more able to easily get at my desired response</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is the photogrammetry stage, which comes before splatting. It determines the locations of the cameras in space, and uses those locations, in concert with the photos, to build point clouds. Camera locations and a sparse point cloud are used as the input in splatting systems.  
    
Current commercial SOTA is RealityCapturer (free, from Epic Games, avalable through Epic Game Launcher), which would probably take several minutes to locate 128 photos and construct a model. RC models might be higher quality, it's harder to tell from these examples. I think most vision models still downscale images, and the scale of this video makes me think that's the case here, which will limit the detail available in results. RealityCapture will use high resolution images.  
    
For the first few examples, I was like, "fast, but meh..." But the zero-overlap example is huge. Taking photos for photogrammetry is painful. You need perfect lighting, you need a stationary or slow-moving camera to reduce blur, you need significant overlap between photos (because the system 100% requires matching details between images to function,) and for anything you want in 3D, you need many views of that feature from different angles to get decent results.  
    
The biggest benefit of this system (apart from speed) seems to be that it's incredibly forgiving in the capture stage. It will fill in gaps in missing data, produce 3D from minimal, or even no overlap, and possibly color-correct in-model? Taking 128 photos is easier than taking 1280 photos to make sure you didn't miss anything, or taking 128 photos, and then having to go back to the site to take additional photos when your reconstruction fails, or spending hours manually adding control points to stitch your model together.  
    
The downside would be that some of the detail is completely faked by the model from zero, or mathematically insufficient data, which means this is either not useable for engineering/construction, or would need to be monitored closely enough to prevent invented detail that it might end up being no easier than existing methods.  
    
What it would obviously be great for is scene/object capture for VFX, games, and art, or even just for capturing memories. My first thought looking at this was that is looks fast enough to build an environment around a VR headset as you move around, even a headset with only one camera, like the original Vive.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Honestly I think what we're all learning is this level of 24/7 exposure for comedians almost 100% of the time leads to getting sick of them. Used to be you might see your favorite comedian pop up in a late show or TV gig every few weeks if that. Maybe a special or movie every couple years. Now it's like a fucking lifestyle brand where people are drinking from an algorithmic firehose of content from their comedians in endless podcasts, Twitter/Facebook/insta/ticktok/YouTube, and now even fucking politics and news for God's sake. Of course we all end up hating them after enough of that. The ones that don't go balls deep into the social media/podcast 24/7 are the ones who might maintain some kind of legacy</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree. These guys are overexposed, and they’re just not interesting enough to justify the sheer amount of content they put out. It’s the same small circle of podcasters/comedians making the rounds, appearing on each other’s shows week after week, talking for hundreds of hours. The problem is they don’t have enough to say to sustain that level of constant exposure.

And I think this actually hurts stand-up comedy as a whole. When these comedians finally release a special, you’ve already heard most of their material in some form on their podcasts. In the case of Tom and Bert, the overexposure has had another effect. It made people realize they’re not as likable as they might have seemed before. When you see someone occasionally, their flaws are less apparent. When they’re constantly in front of you, those flaws become impossible to ignore.

That is what happened. The more people saw of them, the more they realized these guys weren’t worth supporting. Overexposure didn’t just make them annoying. It made people actively turn against them.</div>

I can tell you Kansas City makes tons of Cheese-Its.  They used to make Cheese-Its and Club Crackers when I first started doing projects there.  They got rid of Club and only do Cheese-Its there now.  Sometimes I think they may run some kind of pita cracker, but I haven't been there when those were running.

I know you're all hyped about Cheese-Its in this thread, but Dot's Pretzels are also made in Kansas.

Edit to add:  The bakery is Kellanova (formerly Kellogg's) now, but used to be called the Sunshine Bakery.  They must have been the biggest deal in the neighborhood when the plant was built because the road the plant is on is Sunshine Road.</div>

Well - we can buy that this year for $3000 from Nvidia (Spark DGX).   Or you can get 20 Petaflops for a TBD price.    I'm excited to see what we will be able to do soon.

Kurzwiel's prediction I pulled from his website 3 years ago:

&gt;Some prominent dates from this analysis include the following:

&gt;We achieve one Human Brain capability (2 * 10^16 cps) for $1,000 around the year 2023.

&gt;We achieve one Human Brain capability (2 * 10^16 cps) for one cent around the year 2037.

&gt;We achieve one Human Race capability (2 * 10^26 cps) for $1,000 around the year 2049.

&gt;We achieve one Human Race capability (2 * 10^26 cps) for one cent around the year 2059.

&gt;Human Brain = 100 Billion (1011) neurons * 1000 (103) Connections/Neuron * 200 (2 * 102) Calculations Per Second Per Connection = 2 * 10^16 Calculations Per Second</div>

                <div class="post-content">I was at my balcon and saw this weird line of light in the sky. Never saw this before in my life. I have no clue what this could be. It moved very slowly and after a couple of minutes, the light slowly disappeared and I didn't saw it again. It was very strange to experience it. Any help or ideas what this could be are appreciated.

how about you edit and change this into 99.99%?

agree? *then* we can start talking and have an actual conversation

cause for example, in this video, I do not see multiple satellites, I see 1 unit/line, not multiple satellites linked up

regardless, while these one off sightings are interesting

UAP show up DAILY over at Netcong , within 30 minutes after sunset, first ones show up, not listed on ADS-B

it's only an hour drive away from New York city, this should be *nothing* for you Americans

more people should go and check the skies themselves instead of arm chair debunking others their posts

*edit, after more research, it is probably 99.999% a new starlink launch and disperse chain yes*
