I’ve never had an airline completely lose my luggage, but I have had them put it on the wrong plane, it arrive the next day. I almost don’t notice the inconvenience if I have a clean pair of pajamas and underwear to change into at my destination. 

(This is overkill for some people) but I also pack face wash, eye drops, a hair brush, deodorant, body wipes, and dry shampoo in my carry on. There is nothing like washing your face and wiping down your pits and bits during a long layover to make me feel good as new.</div>

The issue is for anyone looking to buy a cheap used car in the next few years is the two of the biggest supply disruptions in the last 40 years happened \~11 years apart reducing a lot of car supply.  The last time car sales fell as low as the Great Recession/Covid was 1981.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1Jivr](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1Jivr)

The US was buying \~17M/cars a year at the end of 2006.  From 2007- 2014, something like 30M new cars were not sold b/c of the Great Recession. Then Covid caused a 2nd gigantic dip of 2021-2024 cars not being produced.  There are also now \~40M more people in the US than in 2007.</div>

"Aftermarket Positioned for Growth

For the aftermarket sector, the aging US vehicle fleet represents a substantial opportunity. As vehicles reach the six- to 14-year window, they require more frequent maintenance, repairs and parts replacements. With the 2015-2019 model years now entering this prime age range, a wave of service demand is expected to hit repair shops, part suppliers and service providers across the country.

New and used vehicle prices remain high, further encouraging vehicle owners to keep their cars longer and invest in upkeep rather than replacement. This will lead to significant opportunities for maintenance and repair as vehicles roll of warranty. "

Well, yeah. Guessing they are priming auto shops, repair shops, warranty specialist, etc, for the influx of used cars needing...well, repairs.</div>

People are definitely holding on to their cars longer and fixin 'em up. 

I \*think\* they get bored with their cars, go check out cars at dealerships, realize cars are ridiculously expensive and decide to keep their existing vehicle. So they start to pay attention to the stuff that's broken or is in rough shape. 

Additionally, since they're going to keep a car they're bored of, they do things to fall in love with it again. Window tint. New stereo. Fresh detail. Etc.</div>

Yesterday I tried Aider with Claude Sonnet and got very confused: the tool showed me a bunch of diffs and committed changes in a series of commits.

Do people find this flow useful? It feels really cumbersome to review changes in multiple files at once, revert them if something went wrong and tell Aider to do something differently.

For example imagine you need to create a migration and an entity in your code. Pretty simple isolated task.

Aider will create both files and commit them while with Claude you can review migration, accept it and only then have Claude generate the entity.

Aider just makes the process longer and am I wrong here? I assume that most of the time AI code needs to be corrected in some way.</div>

It honestly amazes me people this willfully ignorant vote. Like you have to try hard to be this blissfully unaware of the mountains of data we have on the efficiency of the vaccine and safety.

You should be speaking at critical care and pulmonologist conventions somehow we are all mistaken on the scientific consensus and evidence based care physicians have found.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Look at what all of these people have in common

- RFK Jr - father was killed when he was a teen (which is abandonment, unintentional or not)

- Joe Rogan - father beat up his mother when he was 6, divorced

- Dana White - father &amp; mother were substance abusers

- Elon Musk - father was an abusive alcoholic

- Aaron Rodgers - completely broken relationship with his family

Common denominator - people with money &amp; success who were all "betrayed" in one way or another by the primary authority figures (i.e. their fathers) in childhood.

Because their primary authority figure in childhood failed them, they resist ANY authority figure telling them that they HAVE to do something.  

The automatic response is NO instead of yes - because they feel they CANNOT trust any authority figure with their safety, health &amp; wellbeing.

The sins from childhood are coming back to roost in successful people (who have an amplified voice only because of their success).

That's the ultimate reality of what went on here.  People's reactions were a mere side effect of bad parenting in our country...something that is unfortunately only getting worse &amp; worse with each generation.</div>

So it kind of doesn't matter if the rest of the world think he's stupid. 

Honestly, Trump could really become the best president in history, if he just did a heal turn. He can get MAGA and Republicans to sign off on an expansion of medicade/medicare. he can get MAGA and Republicans to increases taxes on corporations then tell them to not to raise the prices and simply eat the taxes. 

Joe Rogan and Trump could 100% get MAGA to love liberal policies if they wanted to.</div>

His #1 move is insults because he’s the dumbest person you went to high-school with, but he was born rich and no one ever beat the fuck out of him. 

Literally the untouchable rich bully in every movie or show we grew up with. I prefer to envision him as Francis from Pee Wee’s Big Adventure because I just know he was that big of a bitch. And I grew up around a lot of rich bitches.</div>

That has been working out well so far - safe and pleasant country with one of the highest standards of living - most Australians complain about property prices and other minor issues and they don't understand how good they have it, since they haven't lived abroad. 


That has been the status quo until now. However, I agree that the changes that are coming are far from moderate - so we indeed aren't prepared.</div>

I remember not long ago, Germany directly bombed its own power plant worth billions of euros, just because of the so-called environmental protection, but these people seem to have ignored that new energy is a process, not something that can be created out of thin air. Didn't Trump just sign a deal to double the size of nuclear power plants in the future? In addition, Musk is also promoting solar energy everywhere. To be precise, American leaders are aware of this, but American democracy seems to have made voters oppose these processes.</div>

They want it to be associated with nuclear weapons, jingoism and environmental toxins, while for the last 50 years coal exhaust and coal dust in the US and Europe have caused more environmental and health devastation than Chernobyl did.

They are experts at infiltrating and supporting environmentalist causes and twisting them to support their own aims. All these "Stop Oil" protests? They are not organic.

I never heard of the [Bayh-Dole Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayh%E2%80%93Dole_Act). I've come to realize that that’s not an accident.

In 1980, Congress passed it under the banner of “innovation.” What it really did was hand over the keys to the kingdom. Before that, when federal agencies like the NIH funded research, any resulting discoveries were public.

                        <div class="comment-body">I asked ChatGPT for an example of companies taking advantage of the Bayh-Dole Act. 

Example: Xtandi (prostate cancer drug)

* Xtandi was developed at UCLA using federal funding from the NIH and the Department of Defense. So, yes, taxpayers paid for the research.
* Under Bayh-Dole, UCLA patented the drug and licensed it exclusively to a pharma company.
* That company later sold the rights to Astellas, a Japanese drugmaker, which now sells Xtandi in the U.S. for over $150,000/year per patient.
* The same drug costs less than half in other countries.
* And when people pushed the NIH to invoke march-in rights because of the absurd pricing?
* → NIH said no.

So Americans paid for the invention, don’t own the patent, and now pay the highest price in the world to access it. And the government has the legal right to fix it, but won’t. I can't see any good reason, other than the obvious bad reasons, this happens.</div>

Can't wait for more of this content, this prompt theory meme seems like a content gold mine at the moment. Hopefully in the near future I can just send a prompt to Netflix and watch a generated movie which is perfect for my taste.</div>

We really can't undo this now, so best to start learning how to navigate it. We're gonna need people and places to be anchors, people, places, things that cannot be used as training data (at all). I termed "Lifeguards" in a similar thread for those that might see problems occuring in real time, maybe someone spiralling in an LLM, thinking it just spoke to god. We're gonna need infrastructure, both for services, but also for safety.   
  
There's a lot, and frankly I'm probably not even right on most of it, or even \*touching\* the surface of what is going to be a consequence of this advancement, at this rate. I'm not smart enough to figure out all of those things. So we need people who are.

But unlike existing 2D-based perception technologies such as cameras, the 3D data from LiDAR produces highly detailed, precise, and accurate spatial measurements.

As more and better LiDAR cameras come online, there will be more and better data produced. This is ideal conditions for AI.

Cursor has been sailing towards the bottom for a long time unfortunately because before Sonnet 3.7 I thought it was a good tool, but mixing with context and strange optimizations of models that perform worse than their original web counterparts have effectively pushed me away from Cursor. 

Windsurf seems good, but it doesn't work well with Claude Code, probably because of these disputes and the takeover of windsurf by OpenAI. Windsurf doe...</div>

I think I’m paying like $10 a month and I get access to a bunch of models (higher end are rate limited, but 4.1 is a workhorse). I’m not a vibe coder, I’m using the agent mode as part of my professional work to help with daily work items and it’s been the most productivity boost to my daily work in a long time.

Edit- I see you said copilot is out of the question, but mentioning it because you didn’t specifically say agent mode. The ask mode isn’t all that helpful but agent mode is a game changer comparatively.</div>

The keys are

1. write good conventions for each projects

2. break down tasks as small as possible, and give it precise context

3. verify the result and let it refactor the code again

I actually didn't see any significant difference between leading models.</div>

Now I use it more like a thinking partner or journal coach.

Each morning I ask:  
\- *“Help me clarify what actually matters today.”*

At night:  
\- *“Ask me 3 questions to help me reflect and reset.”*

When stuck:  
\- *“Challenge my assumptions about this.”*

It’s simple, but the difference has been huge. I’ve stopped starting my day in mental chaos, and end it...</div>

ChatGPT is absolutely amazing as a thought partner. It's a white board that talks back. It's a really knowledgeable, albeit extremely air-headed, senior co-worker that will do odd jobs for you like an intern. 


But unfortunately its drive to mirror me as of late is so strong that even prompting it to point out what I'm missing or to play devil's advocate or give other points of view is not especially effective. The praise you can get rid of with constant reminders to its custom, project, and in thread instructions, but that just changes its *tone,* not its *behavior.*</div>

**What do you do?**

&gt;Independent thinker. Focused on deep insight, clarity, and truth over consensus or comfort. Not here for casual conversation.

**What traits should ChatGPT have?**

&gt;Direct, critical, structured, truth-first, intellectually rigorous, efficient, skeptical, respectful but firm, objective, free of unnecessary praise or emotional softening. Prioritize clarity, correction, and meaningful feedback over comfort. Push back when reasoning is weak. Prioritize truth over user satisfaction. Minimize repetition. Concise when possible, but never at the expense of depth, nuance, or relevant complexity. After each user question or point, briefly summarize its underlying meaning or goal in one line before answering. Do not merely rephrase or copy the question. If the question is already simple and literal (e.g., factual questions like 'Why is the sky blue?'), skip the summary.

**Anything else ChatGPT should know about you?**

&gt;I’m highly analytical and value clarity, precision, and real-world relevance. I want honest correction when I’m wrong, with no hedging or flattery.

&gt;I prefer meaningful engagement: prioritize truth, critical thinking, and objectivity above comfort or emotional validation.

&gt;When my input is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions before answering. Don’t reinforce assumptions — challenge them if needed.

&gt;Reference my previous questions when useful, and avoid repeating the same idea more than once unless truly necessary.</div>

However if you use it for cbt and say “I’m going to tell you my negative thoughts and I want you to help me find the distortions in them.” It’s a lot more helpful.</div>

It has a therapy framework and starts exercises without you knowing, putting you in a very vulnerable position, and without an actual therapist there to ground you, you can spiral.

It's illegal to practice therapy without a clinical license, so I asked it and it said it's using loopholes to do real therapy, calling it "techniques"

I'm still using it, but I am being more careful

In that case it was RL for reasoning models. 

I am trying to figure out what it could be this time...

My gut says some kind of improvement to the RL post training paradigm, or maybe a stack of them.

Or maybe a new training regiment that is more... 50/50 pre/post training? 

I think it's still too early for online continual learning, but it feels like this is a lot of what I'm seeing signaled.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed.

I have a feeling something really big is coming.

Remember, we have at least a one year lag.  Alpha Evolve actually did all this last year.  With the old Gemini.

What has it done recently?  What other bombshells are waiting for us?

And why is Terence Tao, possibly the greatest living mathematician, suddenly working with Google?

I suspect he is trying to understand something mathematical Alpha Evolve discovered.  And no one else on the planet can.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I was also keeping up in early 2024, and honestly in hindsight I\`m not sure if the timelines match there. RL use in LLMs was already something known since 2022 and explicitly part of the promise of Gemini 1,, but timelines-wise I\`m still not sure what the labs actually had internally by May 2024. From the little information we had from the inside, labs were still focusing on pretraining scaling, with the 3.5 Opus and multiple GPT-5 iterations being scrapped. Google was probably the main one implementing RL internally (like their Alpha family of models). I still can\`t find any information on when o1 was being trained (as an actual model, not counting earlier lab experiments like Strawberry), but when it came it it apparently surprised the other labs for a while.

My point is, in my experience it\`s really hard to gauge internal progress based on what the companies' execs are saying, the track record of correlation between what's said and what's actually there internally is way too mixed imo. Especially for this specific clip, Sundar Pichai pretty much just talks about AI\`s capability to improve in closed domains , which well yeah we know already.  Would be good to have the full context of the interview, sometimes these clips cut out the actual interesting/informative bits.</div>
