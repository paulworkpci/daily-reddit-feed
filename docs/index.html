Your literal job is to talk for the state of FL... Do these people not understand what the job they are applying for is?

That is insanity to say something like that while running for a seat in the legislature. What a lack of understanding of the basic function of the office you are running for.</div>

The amount of atrocities committed in such a short time frame by the apartheid regime of Israel is astounding. I’m gonna be honest, as much as I despise Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, after the vast amount of research I’ve done on the history of the colonial settler state of Israel and their crimes, apartheid, dehumanization, indoctrination, etc. nothing makes me blood boil more than Zionist ideology and oppression. They’ve infiltrated every level of US government and we are controlled by Mossad from the inside out. We are witnessing such an immense quantity of evil being unleashed, that it’s difficult to fathom sometimes.

You can have a genocide without a colonial settler state but you cannot have a colonial settler state without a genocide. Fuck Israel and fuck all the politicians that place Israel over our own citizens/country.</div>

This is such a key aspect people don't talk about, when they label the entire Palestinian people as terrorists.

Often this argument comes combined with the sentiment that Hamas was voted into power and thus somehow people deserve the atrocities happening to civilians.

Now, most of the population never voted for Hamas, they were babies or not even born. Estimates put around 70% of civilian casualties among children &amp; women.

And if we zoom back to the last elections they had - the democratic forces (i.e. Fatah) and lead advisors of the US have urged the Bush government and Isreal to intervene in the elections, or put them on hold. Due to the risk of Hamas starting a civil war and giving the government into the hands of radicals.

Both, US government under Rice &amp; Bush, as well as Israeli government refused to support the democratic forces in Gaza. And later realizing their fuckup tried to overthrow the Hamas.

Sure, you can go through life expecting it to be easy and just expect companions to fall into your lap. That may happen. But I think that it is likely that nothing will ever happen and you continue to live this same boring and mediocre life until the day you die. I think that happens to a lot more people than you think but no one talks about it because no one cares about the boring nobody who keeps to himself.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey, man. 24M, and I'm dealing with a similar issue, but it's a little different. I just got out of the military, don't know what to do with my time, and spend most of my time on screens because it's the most entertaining.

I've also been on a screen since a very young age, and it's almost ingrained in my behavior to crave stimulation. Not exactly good for ya.

I got sick of it. Started going to the gym.
I started Geocaching, building little free libraries, bought a (cheap) motorcycle, got into amateur radio, built my own antennas and crap, etc, and whattya know, I'm still fucking bored.

Well, right now, I'm back to screens, sitting all day, and being a zombie. It's making my mental health worse, this instant, and I'm not doing anything about it right now.

My point is that it's a difficult, complex, and ingrained mental health issue with no easy answer. I hope you can find a strategy for dealing with it that works for you, but man, it's hard. It doesn't mean it's not worth trying though, and you can learn a lot about yourself through it.

But, at the end of the day, I think boredom is good for us. It inspires us to innovate, do shit, and change. Goddamn, is it unbearable sometimes though. Especially when paired with loneliness. 

I don't know you, I don't know your situation, and I don't know what's going on in your head. I do know what I feel though, and it's similar to what you're talking about.

I know it doesn't seem appealing, but try going Geocaching or something when you're going stir-crazy from loneliness. I know a walk in a nearby park helps me quiet my head a little.</div>

Yeah I get it, AI for now won't create the Death of Archimedes like Thomas Degeorge did. But neither will most of the people calling themselves artists today. I know you don't have to be a genius to be considered an artist, but some of these people act like they are the gift to humankind and AI is destroying all this wonderful potential. Yeah no, if AI can create my furry porn I just don't need a human to do it anymore idk.</div>

&gt;We are at a place where we want to displace the process of art making from our lives?

The absolute contrary; we are at a place where we can remove some of the barriers to creating art. instead of the limitation being hours spent with a pencil and expensive training, it's now imagination, vision, and message. someone lacking those 3 will still produce uninteresting art, but someone with all 3 can produce good art without artificial barriers. the biggest barrier is gate-keepers like yourself who want to invalidate their work without evaluating it, simply judging it by the tool use to create it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;AI "artists" shitting on regular artists

It's not one shittin on the other, it's the idiotic vocal 5% in each group who do a pissing contest. Most people just use AI for fun, making their lives easier and work related stuff.

&gt;training from the works of those actual artists lol

How do humans learn to make arts.... They go to (expensive) schools and get shown art and get educated how to create said art. Then after some learning time, the use everything they got trained on to use and create art.

Do you see a connection?

&gt;thoughts and skills that go into the making of the product right

The thoughts are still from humans. The human conceptualizes the image, comes up with a prompt and trys again till it is right. Understanding how to communicate with AI to get the wanted result is also a skill. Not as hard to learn as photorealistic drawing, but harder than drawing abstract art.


PS: You know, you could say the same about mowing the lawn with a sickle, which required skill. The movement, the sharpening, the energy, the time....

Nobody forces you to use a lawnmower, be done in 30 minutes. You can still laugh at the unkilled people useing one, while you stand on your freshly sickled hill after a whole day of work. You do you and the rest of the world will move on.</div>

There’s no way to quantify that in the human brain for everyone to get their fair share but I hope in the future there should be a way to do this. If there’s a hit AI song that uses 1% of Aerosmith, 20% AC/DC, 50% RHCP, and 29% Guns &amp; Roses. Then all of those bands deserve writing credit. I don’t think services like Suno giving a fuck about that as of now but hopefully there’s an agreeable path forward.</div>

if they figure out how to automate programming it opens the pandora box to automating just about everything else

just need the AI to train on how to properly do the job and it shouldn’t take too long to automate it

Metallic Sphere Spotted in the Jungles of Colombia

Location: Colombia  
Time: 13:30

I am not the OP, This video was found on your favourite Chinese Social Media app.

This object seems to be an E.T./Alien Drone of some sort and has been spotted around the world including being filmed by the US military in Iraq.

This is also the same object in this Why Files Documentary: The Betz Sphere: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhBVWX0IkIk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhBVWX0IkIk)

Couple problems with it:
Disjointed editing. There’s a bunch of cuts between clips instead of one long continuous shot. 

The filming doesn’t continue until the object leaves the area.</div>

You can see some sort of rod, cable, or tether at the start of the video and also near the 2:06 mark.  The balloon seems to trace multiple paths that could be explained by it being tethered to a point.

It doesn't do anything a tethered helikite can't do.  But maybe it's aliens flying a kite.</div>

I don't know what they're using here or how far they're zoomed in at points, but when I'm recording things in the sky at 25x or greater zoom, it can be hard for me to swing my mount smoothly and keep the shot perfectly aligned. Every tiny adjustment dramatically changes the view when I'm that zoomed in.
 
Even worse if the person keeps looking at the object rather than watching the camera to ensure it's on point. 
 
This footage is terrible though for quality</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">We don't need to imagine. We have ChatGPT to do our thinking for us.

Ah, good farmer, weary from your day's toil on Count Hunyadi's lands, come rest a moment and let me tell you of a most curious wonder—one that no scribe, priest, or even the learned men of Buda could have imagined.

Far away, in lands beyond the edges of any map you know, there exists a great thinking machine, not made of flesh and bone, but of unseen forces—like the wind that bends the wheat yet cannot be grasped. This machine, called ChatGPT, is like a hundred thousand monks writing and speaking at once, answering all questions, telling all stories, and even creating pictures as if by a painter’s hand, yet with no brush nor pigment.

So marvelous is this device that each hour, a million souls seek its counsel. Imagine a town greater than mighty Buda itself, filled with scribes who never rest, and every hour, a new town of that size is born, all hungering for wisdom and visions conjured from thin air!

You, who have seen much in these troubled times, may wonder: is this sorcery? No, for it is not wrought by demons or spirits but by men who have tamed lightning itself to think and dream. And though this wonder is beyond reach of your plow-worn hands, know this—just as the printing press now spreads words far and wide, there shall come a time when even the humblest peasant may summon such images and wisdom with but a whisper.</div>

at first i didn’t know what to do with it but [theadvault.co.uk](https://theadvault.co.uk) (free) kinda opened my eyes to some of the potential. i feel like people aren’t using it as a collaborator, they just think it’s supposed to do all their work for them

But i would have LOVED if AI could give accurate answers to complex real world problems better than me.

Everyone else was too focused on their own embarrassing moments to remember yours. That 'weird' thing you like? Most people are too caught up in their own interests to judge yours.

It's not depressing - it's freeing. Since realizing this, I've started dressing how I want, pursuing hobbies I used to be scared to try, and just being more... me.

Just thought this might help...</div>

However, you really need to be sincere about it. If you tell me that you want my *guidance* and *mentorship* but then demonstrate by your behavior that you are unwilling to *participate*, such as by taking your phone out to do something else while I'm demonstrating to you... our tutorial will come to an end and I may say "it seems clear you feel you can get better advice from whoever is on the other side of that phone, so I'll just let you continue with them, good luck."</div>

I’m curious to hear from all of you—what’s one small habit or change you’ve made in your routine that’s had a surprisingly huge impact on your productivity? It doesn’t have to be anything big or complex, just something simple that helped you stay on track or get more done.</div>

Anytime I start a feature/task I break it up into parts that I can accomplish is about 1-4 hours. I stop when I complete it. Don't focus on what's left or what you've done, focus on what is next to complete the task.

Con:
Yeah, but there’s a difference. Photography and digital painting still involve a human making creative choices. AI-generated art feels more like outsourcing the creativity. Is it really the same thing?

Yes, anyone *can* use AI to make their own art. But that's not what most people are doing

They're asking for art created by a very gifted yet unusual artist named ChatGPT or Midjourney or StableDiffusion. Its fun, &amp; I don't really see it as evil or anything like that

But that doesn't mean you're the artist, unless you actually you know, did something. **Anything**

Their assumption was that the general public would be interested in reading these, but it was of course just badly written books that mostly only appealed to the authors themselves and maybe some friends and family. It was basically exactly what blogs would become in the 2000s, or what personal websites was in the 90s.

When everyone rushes into the new thing, a lot of bad stuff gets made, but later the whole thing usually matures</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">So you're saying it's only art if it's good art? It's giving lots of "it's only a woman if it makes my dick hard" I think that art even if bad is still art, just like how ugly people are still people. Art isn't about how "good" something is, it's about the desire to create and express oneself creatively. If you believe that you've expressed yourself creatively by just pasting some text into a box and calling it a day, who am I to judge? If a picture is art so is a bad picture. And if you disagree how will you be able to distinguish art from that which is not art? It would be impossible due to personal biases.</div>

I know the world is a mess, but it doesn't do anyone any good to constantly scroll through severely negative topics.

And no one is *fighting the power* by re-tweeting posts and making angry Tiktoks. </div>

It's all distorted through a fucking lens and it's all rife with distorted propaganda, nothing you see online is real, not even people's faces with all those freaking filters, not even the lives that they portay, nothing, and soon with AI it will be even less


OP,  your friends are deeply brainwashed.


 Reality is what happens when you shut down the noise of your phone. All that you see in here, nothing is real.
