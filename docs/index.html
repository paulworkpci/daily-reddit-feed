E.g. one attempt within the CoT generates a path that simply traverses the outside of the maze, but it recognizes on its own this is wrong so it refines the code."

1: Claude 3.5 sonnet. OpenAI released several versions of 4o that couldn't catch up to sonnet for months before o1 dropped

2: Gemini 2.5 pro had a significant lead over o3-mini, and the o4-mini and o3 full releases are only catching up to / on par with 2.5 pro.

  
Remember, in 2022, no one was even close to openai. the rest of the industry was 6 months to 1 year behind.</div>

As a kid, I created a protective bubble around myself, believing that death only comes to the old and that the young people I love - my family - were safe. When my great-grandmother passed away, I comforted myself with the idea that she was old, and it made sense. My bubble simply shrank, and I told myself that the people ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">When fear arises, observe the sensations it produces in your body. Don't resist—accept them fully. Recognize that the very nature of fear is impermanence. Challenge it: "If you're truly so powerful, then try staying forever." You'll find that fear is merely a bluff of the mind—an illusion with no real substance.

You might find inspiration in the enlightenment story of Sri Ramana Maharshi, which goes like this:

One afternoon, quite unexpectedly, young Ramana was struck by a sudden and intense fear of death. It felt as though he was about to die at that very moment.

But instead of panicking or calling for help, he chose to confront it head-on. He lay down on the floor and began to simulate death, asking himself inwardly:

“What is dying? What is this thing called death? Let me find out.”

He imagined his body becoming stiff and lifeless. Then a realization dawned:

“The body is dead, but I am still here. I am not the body. I am the awareness that witnesses the death of the body.”

In that moment, he experienced the Self — pure, formless, eternal consciousness — untouched by death or change. This was not an intellectual insight, but a direct, lived experience.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Vipassana was never designed for people diagnosed with depression and anxiety. In fact, it can be counter-indicated in such situations - exactly for the reason you are describing. Vipassana, if done correctly, will confront you with impermanence, and that *should* move a person to confront the existential fact of their own impermanence too. That's what the "four thoughts that turn the mind away from samsara" are all about, it's the foundation of Buddhism.

And this is why most vipassana retreat providers make you fill out a questionnaire and ask questions whether you have been diagnosed depression, are in therapy, or take certain types of medication. It strikes me as odd if the one retreat you visited did not ask about that upfront. A person struggling with anxiety and depression may be simply overwhelmed when confronted with the four thoughts experienced with the depths of the entire retreat. The Buddhist message is supposed to be: "Ordinary life pursuits ultimately will not bring lasting satisfaction. That's why we should turn towards something that goes deeper than ordinary life pursuits." However, people with depression do not hear this message as it was intended. Instead, what they will hear is more similar to: "Life is meaningless, and will end with death. That's why we must meditate." I hope the difference is very obvious when put so bluntly.

That's why I said vipassana is counter-indicated in that situation. People with depression should not do vipassana retreats, it's as simple as that. They may profit from other forms of meditation, particularly loving-kindness, but vipassana is usually too intense.

Anyway, me venting does not help neither.

The strategy should actually be obvious: Go get help. Work with a therapist. You are saying:

&gt;I don’t know how to cope with it alone.

Well, I hope it's not a surprise, but you are not supposed to cope with it alone. The very idea you are supposed to handle that on your own is the wrong idea. It is the exact verbal expression of the anxiety you are describing: being alone and having to handle with something that is unbearable. In Buddhism there is the entire sangha to help you navigate the complexities of practicing the dharma. And outside of the Buddhist life there are therapists who are trained to help you with dealing with anxieties and depression. That's what you should do: Go seek out a therapist and work with them. In other words: Go get *connection* with others. Compassion, which is another foundational concept in Buddhism, in its core means to be in connection with others. That makes us both vulnerable and alive. It's a very precious thing, and it requires to be cultivated.</div>

TIP: If you’re going this route, splurge on UV-resistant ink or glass. Sunlight will wreck your print faster than you’d think.</div>

The printer should reject it/warn you if it’s too low, but canvas is a good medium to blow up even lower res images. For example sometimes if I see art I like in an Airbnb, hotel, etc. and can’t find a source, I’ll take a photo or scan with my phone and reprint.</div>

&gt;A juggler throws a solid blue ball a meter in the air and then a solid purple ball (of the same size) two meters in the air. She then climbs to the top of a tall ladder carefully, balancing a yellow balloon on her head. Where is the purple ball most likely now, in relation to the blue ball?

Most would instinctively think: "They just gonna fall it's not that deep. So they're both on the floor.". No matter how much we play with words.</div>

Note: o3 in chatgpt is likely the medium compute version, just like o1 is. Sucks we don't have confirmation though.

Since the gap between the full and mini version has been increasing from o1 and o3, as the computational gaps grow deeper. It makes me wonder what kind of beast o4 is, and I'm surprised nobody is talking about it. Like people clearly thinking that o4-full wouldn't be as big as step from o1-&gt;o3 and it would slow down, but this makes it seem like the opposite is true. Of course I'm not just thinking about this benchmark, if you look at the others they look a fair bit more comparable, but it still indicates what kind of beast o4-full must be.</div>

So that either means that the test are somehow harder at specific context lengths or that this due to how context is implemented.

Interestingly most OpenAI models show a similar behaviour on OpenAIs own context test MRCR that they released together with GPT 4.1. There the models have a significant drop for 4 &amp; 8 needles) at 32k but recover again at 64K.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">right now, the terminal and the vscode are all part of the same virtual machine that's provided on the web app, and if you click on the desktop vscode button, it's also the same environment, so they're all linked together  
  
eventually, it'll have some sort of "component awareness" that makes the file system, the "IDE" (think vscode) and the whiteboard aim to all become a single developper environment where you can brainstorm, code and monitor all in the same place, crafted however you like, and that can be AI accelerated with the whole context

                                <div class="reply-body">Google doesn't have to pay Nvidia Tax.

Google doesn't have to pay Azure Tax.

Google's core strength is Infrastructure Engineering. Google Search won, yes because of it's ranking algorithm, but what bought home the cake was their blazingly fast 100ms serving speed on **cheap** hardware.

If you think Google is burning cash to offer this price, you are mostly clueless about Google's culture.

What people don't understand is Jeff &amp; Sanjay are still kings and they still work for Google as Independent contributors

I saw a post about country music and it got me thinking - what kind of music would I play if I ever owned a box?

It would probably a mashup of German death metal, Metallica, and 90’s rap.
