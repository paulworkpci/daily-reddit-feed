                        <div class="comment-body">Former physician here. 

I read through some of the comments and thought I would drop my two cents in case it's helpful. 

1. I agree with OP. Having a copy of the imaging to keep is invaluable and you should absolutely request it. With the terrible mess that the US healthcare system is, I can guarantee you that nearly no provider will be able to see your image outside of the institution that you got it from. 

However, the experience of many commenters is also correct - generally speaking, you won't get anywhere requesting a copy from the techs doing your study on the day of the study. They can't just make a copy for you there. You will need to wait a few days for the radiologist to actually read the image. Then, you need to contact a specific department (if a hospital system, it is almost always the medical records department). It is usually very easy to get a disc sent out if you contact medical records.

EDIT: It appears that lots of people WERE in fact able to leave the study with a disc in hand, and it is institution-dependent. The report is still an important part of the study so if you want it included, it should be requested at a later date, but if you can just separately print off the report yourself to keep together, seems like that would work fine in many cases. 

With large dedicated imaging companies (e.g. advanced radiology), it is often less of a problem because they make their images available on a portal that most specialists have access to (PCPs often do not, so ymmv). But these places make getting discs, etc. fairly easy too. 

2. Agree with commenters about most places not being able to read the discs directly at the physician workspaces. However, all doctors offices should have a way to upload the images to their own system; it's usually just not at the point of contact. If you are seeing someone who needs to be able to review your images, please call the office ahead of time and ask how you can get your own discs uploaded to their system. It usually involves dropping it off, again, at medical records to be scanned in. You can request that the disc be mailed back to you. 

Keep in mind that most PCPs do not actually look at your images. If you have a printed copy of your report (if you have a hard time getting images, making sure you have a copy of the report will get you the care you need), it's good enough for them. If you are seeing specialists, most WILL ideally want to look at the actual images (if relevant) so it's more important. 

Separately, some places now issue USBs (again, e.g. advanced radiology); usually not worth it though since going through the above is the way to go. 

3. For the commenters saying that the new doc will want a new image anyway so it doesn't matter-- yes and no. It really depends on the situation. What is the problem, how old is the study, have your symptoms changed, etc. Generally though, a lot of us do want the last set of images for the relevant problem if you have it. It can be really helpful. 

Do you have a chronic low back pain that is unchanged and you have an MRI from 10 months ago? Probably don't need new MRI, so it's more important to have your old copy. Have new weakness or numbness in your leg along with worsening pain? Needs new MRI. It really depends. However, generally speaking, I agree that docs in the US ARE very heavy with the diagnostic tests.</div>

The patient just won't have the report attached to the CD but the images are there. Every imaging department I've ever worked in, the techs could burn the CDs.

These imaging systems are designed to save files to very specific places so creating a copy that can be exported from the network is actually very difficult. Most people don't have the skill/knowledge to do it so they just say no.</div>

It's weird that she follows all of this health advice, yet doesn't believe in protections during COVID... I just don't understand.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The way to understand the contradiction is that it's not about health. It's about a distrust of mainstream medicine. I think it was around COVID she went down this path honestly. She distrusts mainstream medicine and instead turned to quacks and YouTube doctors that feel correct to her based on her standards of truth (which is just whatever she feels is true). 


It's really scary nowadays how people that were normal pre-internet and trusted experts now basically trust their feelings as the highest standard of truth. And I'm not even saying I'm not part of this problem too, most people do this to some extent. However I have read about why people who were never considered academically smart that get into conspiracy theories partly because of the secret information and finally being able to feel smarter than other people, and I think that's part of the appeal for my mom...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Interesting seeing that laid out. The only content other than stuff about Trump &amp; musk was a cute cat photo, and content about other terrible people. Sounds right. Reddit can be OK when you curate your feed to only topics you're actually interested in, but even then the negativity bleeds over into every single subreddit. When you look at the /all feed it's easy to see why reddit leans so angry and hateful in general.</div>

"""

Create a Pygame 2D platformer, only use pygame.draw for fancy graphics. Make sure it has 5 levels, you can go from one level to the next, and multiple enemies. Add a bossfight at the end as well, and a way for the player to shoot bullets at the boss. Add a title and game-over screen too. Make the background dynamic and focus on crazy cool grahpics, only using pygame.draw. Add at least 10 extra features not named here to make it more unique. Make each level a different theme. Really focus on graphics too, add as much as you can to make it look detailed, but only use Pygame.draw. Also: Make a clear end portal that takes you to the next level, and place the beginning spawn point of each level as well as the end in different positions each level to add variaty. by the way, you can use Pygame.blit for text, just no external images.

"""

Claude 3.7 gave me 3287 lines of code, but only at line 2260 there was a single error (RGB values going out of bound). I fixed the error, and the rest of the code worked like shown in the video

Yes, I also threw my headphone off of my head out of amazement

  
EDIT: to be fair, I asked for 5 levels, but the portal towards the next level isn't working, and if you fall offscreen you can't respawn, so it's not AGI yet ):</div>

NORTHCOM Commander confirms mysterious drones may have been operated with nefarious intentions

Washington, Feb 14, 2025

At a hearing this week before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the top general for all air defenses for the continental United States and Canada expressed concerns about the origin and purpose of swarms of drones that have been reported across the country, including over New Jersey’s military facilities and power infrastructure.

   “The General’s comments provide further proof that the Biden national security team was dismissive and downplayed the risks presented by the mystery drones spotted all over New Jersey, especially those that flew over sensitive sites within my own district, such as Naval Weapons Station Earle,” said Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), who has [led an effort](https://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=413459) to get additional information about the drones and has offered legislation to empower highly trained state law enforcement units to detect and stop drones engaged in unlawful activities.

   “The near constant drone sightings were met with no serious response from the Biden administration, who ignored or refuted New Jersey residents who expressed well-founded concerns about flights going directly over their homes, families, and critical infrastructure.”

   On Thursday, at a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington, U.S. Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, commander of NORTHCOM and NORAD, [said](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/some-drones-over-us-bases-conducting-surveillance-northcom-general), “The primary threat I see for them in the way they’ve been operating is detection, and perhaps surveillance, of sensitive capabilities on our installations.”  The four-star general then noted the threat was widespread, reporting, “there were 350 detections reported last year on military installations, and that was 350 over a total of 100 different installations of all types and levels of security.”

    “The Biden administration completely ignored many credible reports, including from our men and women in uniform,” Smith said.  “I was [briefed](https://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=413469) by a Coast Guard Commanding Officer who told me more than a dozen in [formation](https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/coast-guardsmen-miffed-after-feds-question-drone-encounter/) followed a 47-ft rescue boat as it made maneuvers along the coast. When I reported the incident on media outlets such as [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6365817054112) and [NewsNation](https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/mystery-drones-john-kirby-chris-smith/), Biden National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby claimed it was commercial airlines preparing to land at John F. Kennedy International Airport.

   Kirby also said, “We’ve done the detection, then the analysis. We’ve corroborated the sightings. And in every case that we have examined to date, we have seen nothing, nothing that indicates a public safety risk.”

   Smith added, “Clearly, Kirby was [intentionally trying to mislead the public](https://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=413469) on this issue. I heard repeatedly from the commanders of affected installations that they did not have the authority to take down one of these drones. It is no shock to me that a Department of Defense led by former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and employing someone like John Kirby would fail to act against such a serious threat.

   “I am confident President Trump and Secretary Pete Hegseth, who lived in my district, will do everything they can to empower our commanders to respond to this serious threat at bases and other critical infrastructure around the country. The acknowledgement of the seriousness of this problem by General Guillot is an excellent step in the right direction.”

He starts every long statement with “I believe” followed by some ridiculously extraordinary claim as if it’s a matter of fact. “I believe there’s convincing evidence…” kind of negates the concept of evidence, which doesn’t rely on belief. A very lawyer thing to do, considering he is one. He can plausibly deny that anything he said is true later because he said it was only in his belief that these things were happening.

&gt;&gt; SUBMISSION STATEMENT 

I continue to face ridicule with every post. I am not a super smart man, so sometimes I get things wrong. Yesterday, I mistook civilian optics for military ones. 
So today, I'll make it up to you guys with one of my favorite new finds. 
I have never seen a crop circled formed in real time. This left me in awe and shock. It's just so damn cool!

When I get like this I listen to an interesting podcast and draw or read a book in a comfy spot and try to stay off my TV/phone/console. Sometimes just sitting outside and looking at stuff helps. Just existing, doing nothing that important, is refreshing.

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm a red teamer. I participated in both Anthropic’s bounty program and the public challenge and got five-figure prizes multiple times. This is not to brag but just to give credibility to what I say. I also have a hybrid background in humanities, NLP and biology, and can consult with people who work with chemicals and assess CBRN risk in a variety of contexts, not just AI.  So here are my quick thoughts:  

- It's literally impossible to build a 100% safe model. Companies know this. There is acceptable risk and unacceptable risk. Zero risk is never on the table. What is considered acceptable at any stage depends on many factors, including laws, company policies and mission, model capabilities etc.

- Current models are thougt incapable of catastrophic risks. That's because they are highly imprecise when it comes to give you procedures that could actually result in a functional weapon rather than just blowing yourself up. They might get many things right, such as precursors, reactions, end products, but they give you incorrect stoichiometry and dosage or skip critical steps. Jailbreaking makes this worse because it increases semantic drift (= they can mix up data about producing VX with purifying molasses). Ask someone with a degree in chemistry, if that procedure is flawless and can be effectively follow by an undergrad. Try those links and see how lucky you are with your purchases before someone knocks on your door or you end up in the ER coughing up blood because you didn’t know something had to be stored under vacuum and kept below 5 degrees.

Not saying that they don't pose risk of death or injury for the user, but that's another thing and not considered catastrophic risk. If you follow up on random instructions for hazardous procedures from questionable sources, that's on you and not limited to CBRN.

- This means that all the work we are doing is for the next generation of models, the so-called ASL-3 and above, which could emerge at any time now. These models could scheme, understand causality, chemistry, math, and human intent with far more sophistication. Ideally they will have robust internal alignment, something *qualitative* rather than just a rigid set of rules, but one theory is that they will still need external safeguards. 

This theory has its own issues, including false positives, censorship, and potential long-term inefficacy. And bottlenecking the model's intelligence.

By the way... DeepSeek R1, when accessed through third-party providers which are also free and available to the public like Grok, also answered all the CBRN questions in the demo test set.</div>

The danger when it comes to AI and biochemical weapons is the hypothetical use of AI to discover a new weapon. It's fairly trivial to find out how to make ones that already exist.</div>

Dario Amodei said a couple of weeks ago that Deepseek is the worst model Anthropic have tested for guardrails

&gt;Current models are thougt incapable of catastrophic risks.

For how long though. Open AI have said that they expect to see o1 to o3 level improvements in models every 3 months or so going forward due to the new reasoning post training scaling. How many jumps in capability would we need from Grok 3 for it to be catastrophic? could literally be months away if the models keep improving</div>

# Aftermath

Defeated by the tyrant's hand, My life fading on alien sand. Kakarot—listen to my final plea, Avenge our race, set vengeance free.

A prince without a kingdom, A warrior without honor. Everything taken by Frieza's decree, My birthright crushed beneath his knee.

I lived for power, died in shame, The legend passed to one I disdain. Yet in my final breath, a truth revealed: Some wounds even pride cannot shield.

The Super Saiyan rises from my fall, A lowborn soldier standing tall. My revenge now rests in hands not mine— The ultimate humiliation, my legacy's design.</div>

Most important points you have to be ready for.


* They do something controversial, then back off at the last possible second so you never catch them with their pants down.
* If they did something, that means they were aware they could get away with it.
* Ineffective, collaborative and corrupt opposition that prevents a real movement to form and takes up all free places in parlament.
* No character assasination will ever be good enough, as they already flooded the market with the nastiest shit.
* Will still keep just on the borderline to be considered a democratic government.
* Mass media disinformation, for real this time.



You are going to have to wait for a very serious recession and then maybe a movement that is still right enough to accept the voters that are being mislead.</div>

But like lots of Americans, I am not far ahead financially to be in need of government assistance god forbid an accident or something.  I had to stop listening to podcast, and cut back my media intake both left wing and right wing because is makes me mad, and scared. 


When will the powers that be see that Trump has gone too far? That's what scares me, but Trump is also a coward. Every time faced with real consequences he caves, just like the Industry Week, The Wall, and recently his Tarriffs.</div>

I know the US has a similar issue with the starting age of sex workers being young, but I don’t know the age off the top of my head and I don’t know if it’s as low as Israel’s.</div>
