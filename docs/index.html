David Grusch urges other UFO whistleblowers to go fully public:

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go a little public, go a lot public if you‚Äôre going to go out there for your own protection.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd then you also can control the narrative in the sense that **you can explain your own story yourself versus, you know, somebody else.‚Äù**

                        <div class="comment-body">What‚Äôs crazy is that normally the incoming president gets a few million dollars to help with the transition and can only accept donation up to $5000.

By rejecting the federal funding the incoming president does not have to disclose sources or amounts of donations.

Essentially you can get unlimited donations from anyone without disclosure. 

How is this legal and not a corruption concern?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A friend once showed me his guidebook to how to handle his girlfriend. He'd taken notes on her likes and dislikes, what he'd given her and precisely how she responded, which actions caused which responses in her, what phrases he could quote at her to yield particular responses etc. and then sort of used the information he'd collected to write a little guide to expected outcomes of various things he does, so that he could 'defuse' her if she got mad at him.  If she felt unloved, he had strategies for 'fixing the situation' so he could go back to doing whatever he likes while she gets off his back. "If X, then Y will likely do Z, unless P" 

It was somewhere between "oddly sweet" and "creepily manipulative"


**Edit:** this comment is fascinatingly polarizing. I've skimmed through the replies and the reference to TV show characters aside,  a bunch of people are saying some variation of "how is this even creepy, we all do this to some extent",  while a bunch of others are saying he's a  straight up psychopath</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">In real life? My sister, hands down, and it's an ongoing thing. You remember that scene in The Matrix where Carrie Anne Moss downloads helicopter flight knowledge into her brain? Watching my sister just go about her daily life is like a never-ending loop of that scene. 

Dishwasher is broken? Ten literal minutes of YouTube later, she's got it figured out. The what, the how, the why, and it'll be fixed in half an hour if the parts are in stock at Lowe's. 

Car making a funny noise? Get her on facetime, pop the hood, crank the engine, and she's got it located and ID'd, and estimates from three local shops for you to pick from. 

Random archaeological discovery mentioned in passing on the daily MSN headlines, she read the journal article already, and isn't it interesting how that validates so-and-so's findings from his dig in Chile in the '80s.... Bitch, since when do you know about fossils?

Crazy-complicated super esoteric recipe from Thailand she's never tried? I'll bet you $1000 she'll glance at the recipe twice and whip out a version you could sell in a restaurant. 

She remembers your co-worker's sister's boyfriend's birthday and that he really likes chocolate sprinkles but not rainbow.

She can get a feral dog eating out of her hand and get it to let her give it a bath, and diagnose what's wrong with its back leg from ten paces away.

Hey sis, do you happen to know anything about welding? How to preserve this old dress I found in great-grandma's attic? What I should do about these weird bugs on my tomato plants? Of course you do.

Her bosses at work keep trying to move her up the chain, but she's not interested, because it'll cut into her jam-making time or something. But they all come to her first when there's a question or a problem they can't fix, and they listen on the first go. Her husband says he's seen her ask the general manager what flavor of stupid he ate for breakfast this morning, and seen him apologize for the error in judgement. 

She'll tell you she's not that smart, she just has a good memory, but idk man. It's terribly handy to have her on my side, but if she ever decides to take over the world, we're all screwed.</div>

Once you pull the trigger, since the source of agony (smartphone) is no longer there, you don't even feel the urge to use it. At least after the first few days.

One problem is that you may start using your tv and other devices much much more. So get a time locked box to lock everything in every night until the next evening.</div>

I notice that after uninstalling all social media, I just replaced that time with YouTube. I hate it. If I got rid of my phone, would I just watch stuff on my laptop or TV? It feels like we have to figure out the core issue that causes us to reach for easy dopamine instead of working on impactful stuff.¬†</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">well the main issue is that with any addiction you need a period of complete abstinence. Any addiction specialist will tell you this. The root cause may be a toxic situation as a kid for example but this coping mechanism turned into an addiction which makes it it‚Äôs own seperate problem. But we've structured our society to ingrain technology in every aspect of our life, which makes that very difficult.¬†



What helped me was 1) dumbphone 2) install a (paid) app blocker on my laptop for which there is no workaround and 3) time locked box for tv remote and other stuff. The only way around this would be to break to time safe but I‚Äôm not that addicted to where I would do that. If I were, I would probably book a trip somewhere for like 1-2 months and I would take only a dumbpone with me for tech.</div>

Yes there are resources but they aren't really accessible, the mines have all been here for 100+¬† years and most of the easily accessible resources are depleted. There is a big number of resources on extremely low depths but it requires very big investments and many mines have been closed since they can't afford that. Also most of it is coal, which is a thing that is becoming outdated in modern world. I can't speak for all areas but at least in my area it was this way</div>

‚ÄúInfinite free energy‚Äù and ‚Äúthere are solutions to all of our problems but the bad people are withholding it from us!‚Äù are the oldest most played out conspiracy theories in the book. 

These claims have been floating around for literal centuries. There‚Äôs a YouTuber named bobbybroccili who released a 3 part deep dive on the history of infinite energy conspiracies. It‚Äôs 3 1/2 hours long total and fascinating. The subject is a con artists wet dream. The charlatans opus Maximus.  

It‚Äôs such a simple worldview when you think about it. It splits the world into good and evil, good guys and bad guys, and gives us hypothetical answers (forbidden knowledge) to all of our problems that are just out of our reach. It‚Äôs much more comforting than ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know what the fuck we are doing and the world is insanely complex.‚Äù

Edit: did a little research on this guy. 95% of the results are rehashing the exact information in the picture. Seems it‚Äôs part of ‚Äústrange science lore‚Äù. The rest is‚Ä¶. Weird. He‚Äôs deep in the mystic and crystals world. Here‚Äôs a taste of renowned ‚Äúphysicist‚Äù Mark Comings at a psychedelic festival in Portugal in 2004. It‚Äôs from his YouTube and it‚Äôs the only thing he‚Äôs ever posted. Definitely the same guy all the memes are referencing. 

https://youtu.be/5Ywn25ePj8c?si=2JYTLDyoa6LE9P5F

Or take a gander at his writings. It is seriously impressive how much pseudoscience and nothingness he can fit into one sentence 

http://harmoniccontinuum.50megs.com/custom3.html

Double edit: it just keeps getting more and more interesting. I was reading the insane comments in the YouTube video and he seemed to have a well known wife and father in law. 

Mark comings was married to [Dr. Elizabeth Targ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Targ) who famously published a study (funded by the NIH) to study the effects of prayer on HIV AIDS, claiming that prayer significantly improved the results of AIDs patients. Her father was [Russell Targ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Targ) who led research into the ‚ÄúRemote Viewing‚Äù phenomenon at Stanford in the 70‚Äôs.

This anti-procrastination hack, created by Merlin Mann, is ridiculously simple. All you need is a timer and your to-do list.

	1.	Set your timer for 10 minutes. For those 10 minutes, focus on your task with single-minded intensity. Like, seriously. It‚Äôs just 10 minutes‚Äîno ‚Äúquick research,‚Äù no doom-scrolling. Just work.
	2.	After the 10 minutes are up, set the timer for 2 minutes. This is...</div>

As someone with ADHD, this has never worked for me. In fact, it‚Äôs just about the least effective productivity ‚Äúhack‚Äù I‚Äôve tried, because I usually do my best work when I‚Äôm in that flow state, but this is designed to rip me out of it every few minutes.

But everyone‚Äôs brain is different, so if it works for you, more power to you!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My favorite way to use the Pomodoro method as an ADHDer is to put on background music with a sleep timer for 25 minutes; if I don‚Äôt hit a flow state and I‚Äôm still dragging when the sound stops I can take the break and try again, but if I‚Äôm in flow I either don‚Äôt notice that the sound is gone or just hit play again. I find sound stopping much less likely to yank me out of flow than the jangling new sound of an alarm.</div>

I believe in this concept, but what if you haven't found people with goals that align with yours yet? In that case, is it better to focus on hustling alone, or should you still spend time with your current friends, even if they aren't as driven and prefer to relax/play video games most of the time?</div>

But I do also think having people around you that challenge your goals is a good thing aswell. But instead of engaging in the usual activities with them (gaming), maybe ask to go paintballing instead? It's kind of the same thing, but in person and more active. 

As long as you can relate it to their current hobbies, they should be willing to push into it.</div>

Kind of like at my job. There are people who go with the flow and are chill. They're not necessarily trying to improve themselves or the workplace, but they also don't add negativity or anything that creates a toxic workplace. They also give input that allows you to reflect on your own actions and you can learn and grow from there. 

... And then there are the co-workers who are actively burnt out and everything they say is demoralizing and influences others to have a demoralized outlook too. They do all of this without any self reflection or accountability or responsibility of their own actions on what could be improved

Similar to the other comment, surround yourself with people that can challenge you or help you grow even if they are not like-minded. But I would definitely protect yourself around people who seem to have an agenda of convincing you that there's no point in even trying</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Cool stuff but I wouldn't read into this that "they can predict your thoughts". From my skimming of this, it looks like they're predicting future states at a resolution of 400 "zones", that's very coarse. The human brain has 100 trillion connections! Also, fMRI is measuring blood flow, not neuronal firing.

This is basically saying if you know the current blood flow state of a brain at a coarse detail level you can accurately predict the next few seconds of blood flow. That is very cool but not particularly surprising given that blood is a liquid which has to follow the laws of physics.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If I am reading it correctly, they are predicting based on ~400 points / "zones" in the brain. Almost everyone agrees that Newtonian physics are deterministic, but the "magic sauce" people use to explain free will is often at the subatomic level, so this is not going to even touch that.

Also, fMRI measures blood flow, not directly measuring synaptic activity or anything like that. So this is basically saying that if you know the blood flow state of a brain in a coarse resolution you can predict the next few seconds of blood flow.

Anyone who gets into an MRI machine already consents to having someone else analyze their brain's blood flow patterns. I'm trying to think of anything bad that could happen from MRI technicians predicting briefly into the future, since MRI technicians can get that same data just by waiting several seconds.</div>

That *is* useful for a lot of things, it's also a far, far cry from being able to replace senior, seasoned people.  I get irritated at sr folks who assume AI is worthless.  I also get exasperated with entry level folks who think that AI is on the verge of replacing us.

Jr folks who use AI as a crutch and use what it gives without questioning it are doing themselves a great disservice.  Sr folks who refuse to use it entirely are also holding themselves back.

The folks who are *really* going to succeed over the next decade are those who use it as a 'pair partner', just like how human / computer teams in chess can still beat either ai or human teams.</div>

These benchmarks with isolated and closed issues with well defined questions and answers don't excite me anymore.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I second your opinion. I tried to modify some code and write some tests in a large Golang app I'm collaborating on this past week. Not a difficult task, but fairly involved in terms of all the things you had to account for. So I thought this is a perfect task for an LLM. And while Claude was very helpful in getting some boring things done, it required so much correction and proding at times would even spin in circles alternating between repeating the same thing over and over again.

It would also do some pretty dumb things. Like it was making a mock method on a  Golang interface one at a time. Even trying to instruct him to look at the interface method signatures, but he would just ignore it. Basically there is a limited number of concepts it can understand at any one time.

The other issues current LLMs have is they just don't have enough context. Some files in the project I'm working on Claude can't even read because they are larger than its context. But even with feeding him relevant bits through prompts it was like working with a toddler.

In Golang testing, one of the idioms is to build a slice of tests, and then pass those tests to a test runner. At one point it started adding tests right in the test runner loop. Silly things like that. I had to undo mistakes often.

Anyway, I spent about $50 dollars on Claude and countless iterations, and finally I just finished the task myself, because Claude couldn't do it.</div>

I just remind you a year ago people were laughing at that "stupid" AI can't write a simple code without errors...


Currently o1 is capable of writing quite complex applications with 1000+ lines at first attempt without any errors.

I'm much more excited about small, cheap models trained on synthetic user interface task sequences. The ability to get low latency on-device assistance in carrying out basic 4-5 task actions on my phone, for instance, is long overdue.</div>

The video of children engaging with an AI tutor makes me think of this. Those kids will never live in a world where the computer, device, robot, or even mind augmentation, doesn‚Äôt communicate back to them, understand them, think with them, generate amazing content out of thin air, and open countless new doors we can‚Äôt even imagine yet. 

But I do think we‚Äôll adapt, even though it will be messy.</div>

It‚Äôs just full of way too much negativity now more then ever (but that‚Äôs how most people get views) and censorship. I miss the wholesome feel it had back in the early 2000s when there was so much more freedom, creativity and variety. Now everything just sounds the same, brainrot content, clickbait, drama, basically TikTok 2.0, lots of creators who‚Äôve been there for years are trying to find alternatives and now bots/AI are involved to. The only things I go on there for nowadays is for looking at indie animations or web series, some alternative news &amp; tutorials I try to limit my use to an hour.</div>
