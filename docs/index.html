                                <div class="reply-body">In a similar vein, I've been worried I was falling behind recently, but I don't think I have been. I'm an older dev with a backlog of projects that AI has helped me dust off and complete. Around last Christmas I start utilizing LLMs heavily, each month picking a new AI sector and building a project with it.

It wasn't until July that I decided to bite the bullet and dive into Cursor, Codex etc. And boy, I don't think I was missing all that much. This entire time I've primarily been coding in Notepad++ with some PyCharm. I'd talk with the LLM, then utilize its snippets, but I'd manually move all the code over myself which forced review for each section. AI is writing damn near all my code now, but only in chunks.

I'm sure I am missing a shitload in Cursor and will now need to learn all the tricks many of you already have, but already LLMs have increased my productivity ten fold. Much like others have mentioned, I find it most helpful in sprinting through walls. I know how to structure large programs and design all their little parts, but there is always some math or tricky bits that we all spend inordinate amounts of time on or simply sections that require days/weeks of busy work. LLMs can power through those in minutes or hours so that we can keep trucking. Or it allows us to dip into sectors we'd never dare touch before without deep dives or asking a friend/consultant to guide us. 

I think thus far, AI has been best used like a calculator. I'm still coding, but it's writing the code, one chunk at a time. No way would I trust it to one shot an app or site or service; not with what I've seen it mess up already. But can it one-shot every bit of one when directed and reviewed? Hell yeah they can! And their math capabilities are far, far beyond my own. 

Anyone have any cool tips/advice for AI-powered IDEs? I've been learning Cursor, but I'm really not a fan. I have API keys and credits to all the major players, I'm open to any. I'm particularly interested in trying ChatGPT5 Pro with VSCode (primarily in python). Do they pair well? I saw that ChatGPT5 made an effort to move into the IDE space but haven't deep dived that yet. Cursor fees can get pretty insane and it's awfully fiddly, and I've found ChatGPT5 to be the best for coding, able to solve problems that the others don't even recognize; so I'd like to look more into that.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">At the risk of stating the obvious, *everything* about this will improve rapidly over the next year:

* inference speed: Right now you have to wait a fair bit to get a response from the model. If you've seen rapid inference via Cerebras or Groq, that's more like what we can expect. The main thing to wait for will be build/verify pipelines, not the agent writing code.
* edit targeting: the way agents "edit" files currently is pretty sad to watch (lots of grepping/diffing and attempts to target patches that often go wrong). As context grows and architectures improve, we can expect this to look a lot more like a human editing a file.
* scaffolds (the thing that drives the agent): there's so much room for improvement here. Better auto-checkpointing/self-reverting, spawning of sub-agents, specialized models for GUI/terminal interactivity, etc.
* the models themselves: now that people are using these tools daily to write lots of code, every base model improvement makes *humans* driving them more effective at their jobs. At the scale of use we already have, even a 1% increase is massive -- like all of software development suddenly getting a 1% intelligence boost.

So these interviews are interesting, but they're interesting in the way that interviews from people who got their first iPhone are interesting. Or perhaps more accurately, the first dial-up modem. You can see where things are headed, but don't draw too many conclusions based on the current limitations. Especially of the "this will never" kind.</div>

This is a massive gap currently. It'll just keep trying different things over and over and over, but doesn't clean up its failed attempts very well and bloats the context with all the mistakes it makes.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Idk it's like dual core operating. I stub out the solution, have the agent finish the solution while I go stub out the tests, by then it's done with the solution, I review the solution at about the level I do any PR and see if it got the gist of the solution. Hand tweak it if needed, tell it to generate the test bodies based on existing tests while I go off and optimize the solution itself. Basically takes care of the tedious parts of coding. I don't really babysit it, mainly just send it off, do something else in the meantime like double check data models, etc. I'm getting a lot more done and feel far less stressed... until it just gets Alzheimer's and fucks up everything but that's why you commit early and often.</div>

What it means is that the real meat and potatoes of common law, precedence and rulings, aren't willed into existence, they always lag the facts like a specific case which has concrete facts. Only once presented with the facts do you deliberate how law is supposed to apply.

                                <div class="reply-body">What are the limitations of GPT Plus when coding? I mean, how much code can it handle and how many queries can you make?

I've spent a few weeks working with Copilot and it's been working surprisingly well, but the quality has dropped significantly as my project has grown. It's now \~5500 lines of code where I need to reference an SDK (mostly a couple of fairly small header files) plus a project on Github that's maybe 2-3K lines (I'm basically working on porting the project from Python to Cpp, with some core changes).

The good thing about Copilot is that it seems almost unlimited. Biggest problem there is that I sometimes have to force it to read my updated code (insanely frustrating at times). It likes to either pull from outdated "memory" or making shit up. Never ran into a hard token wall or anything though.

As for learning, I actually think this is a good way to learn. I'm not a good coder but I've learned a lot by using Copilot as my assistant. And it's also learning by building some cool shit, which makes it more fun.</div>

now that they have every lever of power in the government right now, as well as ownership of all the main social media platforms, their ability to puke out messaging to millions and millions of people instantly is overwhelmingly effective.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It takes a lot of work and self love/appreciation. Also buying clothes that fit instead of trying to fit in our old clothes. When I started crossfit I weighed around 150lbs, now I'm around 180. I've gone from a small to a medium and was in larges for a bit. It can definitely be a bit of a mind fxck but celebrating the strength of your body and being neutral when maybe you're not loving your body helps a lot in the long run. It helps when you have friends at the gym that hype up your abilities too so if you don't have a ton of friends there, try to make some. Usually if I notice someone did something really well, beat me in a workout or was excited about a heavy lift I try to give them a compliment/encouragement and it usually comes back around.</div>

After a few mins in to her class, I stripped off warmups and was in bike shorts and a muscle tank. She bellowed across the gym “HOLY SHIT —— WHEN DID YOU GET RIPPED?” 😅🙈 I had to look around for a min to realize she meant me!</div>

I had to accept the changes and now I love how my quads look in short shorts and my upper body when I have body fitting t-shirts or sleeveless tops on. I also got rid of the scale at home.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I hear you and I’ve been there! Add to the CrossFit gains the fact that I’ve had a baby and my body image has never been worse 🙃 Ive been trying to reset myself every morning with some affirmations - like “I love that my body can hike 25 km” or “ I love that my legs can deadlift over 300lbs” or “I love the my body free a whole human from scratch” it takes some real time and effort to retrain your brain but I’m hoping it works. Another thing I’ve hear is that buying clothes that actually fit you well can do wonders for your body image, because ultimately things that fit your body properly make it look better! 

For more sciencey reasons, women that lift are less likely to have osteoporosis as they age, and less likely to suffer from diseases like MS, Parkinson’s, or Alzheimer’s. And that’s not even mentioning all the benefits in preventing heart disease and metabolic syndrome. 

All the best to you - strength over smallness every day!</div>

It’s rare that I see women in the wild with a body like mine because it’s more uncommon to have as much muscle as us crossfitters do and it can be discouraging. I feel like I stick out a lot, I feel very masculine BUT when I’m in the gym and I see these amazing strong women I look at them in awe like they are the most beautiful people I ever seen and I feel so confident about my body in that setting. It’s very interesting</div>

A new dexterous hand is here. DexcelRobotics, a startup founded by a former core member of Tencent Robotics X, has launched its first product, the Apex Hand. The company claims it's the first in the industry capable of operating a cell phone with a single hand.

The Apex Hand is a well-rounded performer, with a focus on real-world application. Here are its key specs:

► Degrees of Freedom: 21, which the founder notes is enough to replicate most human hand functions.
► Strength: A singl...</div>

The government posted pictures of Kirks casket being loaded onto Airforce two less than 24 hours after he was shot. Your telling me that in less than 24 hours they did their forensics, found a Funeral Home to process him, cleaned up his body, embalmed his body (with major vascular damage) repaired  the neck wound, dried him, dressed him and casketed him. This is assuming that they didn't get a Death certi...</div>

An autopsy can be pretty quick when cause of death is obvious. Basically things can be sped up to keep the media away from where his body is held, the reason is because these morticians have other work, and there’s other families that are grieving for their loved ones. He’s also in a basic yet nice casket that’s easily obtained.  The fact that he was transported on AF2 immediately they obviously didn’t have to make arraignments and plans for transportation to a cemetery.</div>

&gt;• Establish basic practice

&gt; • Cultivate core skills (attention, clarity, equanimity)

&gt; • Normalize common stages (early calm, fear spikes, energy shifts)

&gt; • Point to good sources (quality books, talks, and teachers)

                        <div class="comment-body">Thank you for your post. As someone who had CPTSD and had mostly recovered from it before getting into mindfulness, meditation and Buddhism, I would say that many people should get professional trauma therapy before starting a regular meditation practice. The reason is that most spiritual teachers are not professional therapists (you have some rare exceptions like Dr. K at r/Healthygamergg but they are very rare and hard/expensive to access), and there are targeted modalities like EMDR/IFS/TRE that could really help with trauma effectively.

This is also what they do at r/starseeds. Even I don't agree with their New Age ideology, there is one thing they have been doing right: they put trauma recovery as one of the very first steps before going deeper into the spritual practices (cf. [https://www.reddit.com/r/starseeds/comments/1bkp7qz/the\_ultimate\_guide\_to\_selfhealing\_and\_becoming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/starseeds/comments/1bkp7qz/the_ultimate_guide_to_selfhealing_and_becoming/) ).</div>
