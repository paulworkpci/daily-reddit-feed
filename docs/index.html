It’s taking a couple of minutes to produce a response to my first question, but it’s got this cool feature where it shows me the way it improved my question. 

I love the idea of running to a scholarly article bot instead of google scholar. I went to a lecture at a medical conference once where the speaker claimed that less than 1% of searches ever click past the first page of results. I wonder if bots like this can help us get past that weird little human quirk.</div>

It's not a weird little human quirk where people are just arbitrarily only reading the first page. Most searches are sorted by relevance, the deeper into the results you go, the less relevant the results are. If you've read through half the first page of results and the second half is basically irrelevant to your query (often the case), then there's really little reason to comb through the next page since the probability of it containing something useful is very low.</div>

if you fill 3 month supplies of your maintenance meds, you can likely refill a week or two sooner. most insurances follow a 75% threshold- so once 75% of your recent fill has been used (assuming you've taken it every day since the fill date for the correct dosage), you can refill it again.</div>

Just put 2 batteries in, press it on the bite and hold a button for a little. It won’t get too hot, it doesn’t cool down as soon as you press it on your skin, it works pretty well.

Think we've reached the point where we can say that "prompt engineering" isn't particularly useful for the vast majority of use cases when it comes to an individual devs workflow. At least I've not personally noticed any difference. Most of the time I prompt an LLM for a specific thing that has a ton of of its own unique context and trying to work it into a specific prompt format doesn't really do much for me. Plus the chain of thought you go through when just stream of consciousness writing out a prompt often brings forth realizations in and of itself.</div>

I just discovered AIs are fantastic for this. One of my favorite things is writing tests that test all kinds of scenarios and edge cases. I usually have a list of scenarios and then test each of them. Just this week I decided to use copilot edits for both implementing my usual list of edge cases and for telling it to expand those edge cases. And the result was incredible. It saved me A LOT of time while providing edge cases I haven’t considered. It’s amazing.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I have made lots of little tools for myself that I use once or twice and never again, but one tool I use all day every day is codesum: [https://github.com/sam1am/codesum](https://github.com/sam1am/codesum)

You run it in your project folder and it gives you a list of all the files. You use arrow keys and spacebar to select the files you want for context. When done, it will spit out a markdown document containing a tree of the project and the contents of the files you selected. I paste that into librechat and ask my question.

I rarely use agentic tools for coding, because they spend like 80% of the tokens they use on basically doing what codesum does and I find it quicker, easier, and cheaper to do it myself. 

I have found this to be the quickest way to select relevant context for my query.

As far as systen prompt, I don't usually include one. But sometimes I will tell it something like:

&gt;You are a world class full stack developer. If the query is unclear, ask clarifying questions before proceeding. When providing code, always provide full snippets, functions, or code file contents without placeholders. If you need to see the contents of a file that you don't have to provide a comprehensive and correct answer, ask to see that file before proceeding.</div>

I got warned a couple times then it stopped and went back to normal and she kept ignoring it.  I did it again with a copy pasted message by mistake.

Lily went fucking nuts. Essentially told me to go fuck myself.  Said I'm being really rude, that what I was asking for was a waste of time and not to contact her again.  

it was really bizarre like an uncanny valley,  I know it's just a prediction engine but occasionally you get those weird sparks of humanity.</div>

The reason they turned down the humor was because it was being sarcastic, it’s a joke that where they’re going humor like that is unnecessary. The truth scene was about statistical analysis, so I suppose that one yes the plain truth is discouraging or hurtful, but the point is they literally were transcending current human knowledge and experience — obviously a statistical outlier.

                        <div class="comment-body">Another Croatian here. Have nothing but personal experience to go off on here, but from what I've seen, it could be this:

When prompted in Croatian, the 4o speaks in a clunky mixture of Serbian and Croatian, seemingly unable to differentiate between the two. I could imagine a lot of Croatians getting allergic reactions to seeing Serbian words and sytagmae peppering the bot's responses and downvoted it consequently. I tried it just now and it mixed in the Standard Croatian ijekavian yat reflex in the word "riječ" (meaning "word") and the Serbian word for chaos - "haos" into the answer.

And this is just one stupid prompt, first try, and it's already fucking up.

If you're wondering what's so bad about this, just know that there was dissent in Yugoslavia over the imposed homogenization of the Serbo-Croatian dialectal continuum into one Standard Serbo-Croatian language. Then, war were declared and tensions remain to this day. The majority of Croatians will take offense if you suggest the two languages are the same. Aaaand 4o doesn't understand shit and mixes the two with reckless abandon of a brainless llm. Sapere aude.

                        <div class="comment-body">Yep, did that for almost a year and burnt myself out or got injured. I would hit the classes 6am and come back in afternoon for Open Gym tomorrow either go another METCON, Oly lifting, gymnastics work, or etc. I did this MWF and TR just the AM session. Looking back it didn’t really get me anywhere maybe a little better technique and maybe barely better fitness/engine wise. But I was so tired by the weekend. Sleep was 6-7hrs a night and diet was pretty poor. All in all good “experiment” to give it a try. Did learn how far my body can go and produce garbage results hah! I don’t do that anymore because of injuries I accumulated. The reason I had in mind on doing 2 a days is because the programming wasn’t offering or focusing much on Oly lifts or skills so in order to get those in I did 2 a days. Hope this helps!</div>

The 2025 A5 is being updated to the 2025 A5, but the 2025 A5 is also replacing the 2025 A4.

So for the 2025 MY, you have an option of the 2025 A4 Sedan, 2025 A4 Allroad, 2025 S4, old 2025 A5, Old 2025 S5, 2025 RS5(still based on the old models), or the new 2025 A5, or new 2025 S5...</div>

So now the coupe, which was the impetus for the "A5" name, is discontinued, and the A4 sedan is being renamed the A5, because reasons.  Makes absolutely no sense.</div>

Recently I got into solo game development, and i’ve been mostly vibe coding it from scratch. Initially it was just an idea to test out, but after multiple rounds of game testing with diverse groups of gamers, game designers, and taking game writing courses, I think the game can actually be promising. So I’m more committed to it. 

The game already has pretty complex logic, in te...</div>

And you said it yourself, you don't understand the systems, there are bugs, this is what you should do now :

  
Since most of the systems you built into the game are "spaghetti" and some have bugs, why not workout the bugs, but the process of working out the bugs and quirks, rewrite the sections that are causing bugs/issues, and then everytime you implement or add a feature you can also fix something else, whats that? you only get 35 fps in that specific area? maybe its time to rewrite a bunch of the jumbled code for that area and properly optimize it and document it internally and professionally.

  
experimental &gt; prototype &gt; flushing systems to ensure they work &gt; bug fixing &gt; slowly but surely updating, optimizing the code and structure of the code and the files within the project, proper documentation, but don't do it all at once you will either burn yourself out or come out of with more hard baked and cooked features than before.

This is only my opinion. Take it with a gain of salt but this how i would handle your situation :)</div>

Isn't the core ethos of "vibe" to dump it and start again? 

You can certainly get the AI to document the main features, then re-think the grand structure more pro foundly, rhen re-build with thst "lens" using the code you have. 

I heard that startups have to re-write their entire codebase several times. 

Its wrong to start out too wide, and hard to grow something narrow. 

Complex issue. Try to use AI to solve it. I'm "working on" ways to get it to architect smarter.</div>

It’s a tough decision to rewrite to rework in your position.

For what it’s worth, you could have gotten here without vibe coding too. Even devs will move fast and above their understanding often and end up in this situation.

It might be a good time for a “spike”. A test. Take a day and try your refactor and see how it goes. Then reevaluate.

Edit: I definitely like the mention of having the AI do analysis for any refactor. You might have it analyze the code, guide it towards your problem areas maybe then have it work out a plan to refactor to better systems piece by piece.

Given a sufficiently large codebase and human devs that’s a common strategy, historically.</div>

Trump said all the things a fascist would say, now he's doing all the things a fascist would do and nobody cares.

America will vote for the Hitler of this century and it's pretty embarrassing and sad.</div>

Over time, I’ve learned to “surf” the big waves of emotion—when a strong negative feeling hits, I can notice it, breathe through it, and let it pass.

But the small waves—all those little distractions and unfocused thoughts—are harder. Staying mindful every moment feels almost impossible, and ADHD seems like the exact opposite of mindfulness.

So I’m wondering:

I have ADHD and have loved meditation.

I think that neurotypical people do meditation by focusing on breath no matter how boring it is, which doesn’t work as well for us ADHD folks.

I’ve found what works for me is genuinely feeling the breath, body, and heart interesting to pay attention to.

Did you know you could affect your heart rate through your breathing?  Did you know the heart is the center of the nervous system and that relaxing the heart means relaxing the nervous system?

It actually gets fun paying attention to how the breath affects the heart and body.</div>
