You have these YouTubers/social media influencers or journalists with all sorts of extremely expensive machinery - yet I can't think of one who has a Lexus. Doesn't matter if it's a journos like Harry Metcalfe or Chris Harris, a television personality like Clarkson, Hammond or May, or one of the big name YouTubers like Shmee.


Lexus's "problem" is that they're not flashy cars - and that sells to younger folks. Why do you honestly think the likes of Mercedes AMG, Audi RS, BMW M or even Land Rover SVR put super shouty exhausts and all sorts of fake vents and non-functional aero on their performance cars?


As an example look at the car in the title image of this thread. Unless you look at it closely it may as well be a Toyota LandCruiser 300 Series.</div>

I could go to DR, but I'd prefer not to pay. I do have a lot of ankle and knee pain throughout my day. From what Im reading so far, those are flat feet syomptoms but don't necessarily mean it is flat feet. Maybe there is a also a list of symptoms?

Edit: I mean more like pain... what type of pain will I feel?</div>

That said, there's nothing wrong with flat feet (aka low arches). All the "problems of flat feet" are actually just problems of *weak* feet. Furthermore, you're unlikely to diagnose your own issues accurately. You can choose between suffering and shooting in the dark with your own guessed remedies, or paying up to see a podiatrist, orthopedist, or physical therapist. Like, it's 100% possible that your issues have nothing to do with your feet and are actually from tight hip flexors or weak glute meds or whatever.</div>

I struggled with hip/knee pain whenever I was running regularly, especially if I used ‘stabilizing’ shoes to compensate for my overpronation.

About 15 years ago I started wearing barefoot style or flat shoes and shifting to a more natural barefoot walking/running gate instead of the more common heel strike that is prevalent with heavily padded running shoes and eliminated all my knee issues.</div>

I write this post with different types of people in mind: beginners, those who are inconsistent, and those who are consistent but do little meditation. These are people familiar with meditation but not intimate with it.

I am someone who really values his mental health - I have read books about meditation, willpower, I exercise, I run regularly, I do breathing exercises, and I have had an on-and-off relationship with meditation for three years.

Some nice points of view, I for some reason hadn’t thought to try meditation everywhere! (I do have mindful moments, for example in a queue, sat in traffic, walking the dog) but seated meditation in every available room in the house! 

I felt guilty about meditating in bed, but I know sometimes my health is compromised and that is the only place I can do it - and if I fall asleep, my body probably needed it! 

It’s knowing stuff intellectually and then understanding it in your very bones/being! That latter is a life time of practice!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Peter Thiel explained that there was a conversation between Hassabis and Musk about AI. It was either on Rogan or NYT interview, feel free to look it up. Paraphrasing from my mind:

Originally, Elon for Mars was supposed to be a political project establishing an anti-woke libertarian dream society away from Earth tax collectors and woke AIs. Science was an afterthought.

Hassabis clarified to Elon that any sufficiently capable AI system would be able to follow him to Mars without problems. 

So that’s when Elon realized he can’t escape „wokeness“ and create a walled off dream society and he appeared frozen by that idea.

If you ever think about why Elons shift is seemingly moving from Mars to AI (Grok), this seems like a good pointer to me.</div>

We could wait 10x as long or we can spend 10x as much.

This is going to bite off far more than we could chew. We are struggling to keep pace with the advances and struggling to capitalize on them. I am 100% certain that we could get the same "cure cancer" result with the current frontier models if we used the right reinforcement learn and bespoke tools. We don't need a monster 10x the size to do that.

This is a hammers and nails problem if I've ever seen it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">1\. You are right that this article is gonna make it pretty tough to get money from those countries, but...

2\. It seems like he might be quoting one of Antrophic's (governance) principles verbatim? I.e.:
&gt;No bad person should ever benefit from our success.

Still, of course he could have used Claude to "work around" this explicit mentioning. But then, he might have needed to sacrifice clarity in his internal communication. Also not good for a CEO.

3\. Technically, I don't think he is referring to the ones that they considering taking money from as *bad people* directly. The bad person or the bad people are the authoritarian governments of those countries that he doesn't want to benefit from their AI. So, he is more worried about the indirect effects of those governments exerting their power on the investment companies, that in turn could press Antrophic to do "bad" things.</div>

Unfortunately, we have been shown that AI is not a problem that will get fixed by a smart person writing a cool line of code. It takes massive investment in data centers, and those take massive investment in power infrastructure. 

You will not have a person win this race if they are not going after every avenue possible to get those two things along with smart researchers. If you can convince the US government along with the PRC to inact a laundry list of reforms tomorrow, then maybe, but that isn't going to happen. Is it sad?

OAi blew it by announcing they did it before the math people wanted them to and Goog respected it to allow what might be the last smartest people on the planet to bask in it.

EDIT TO BE CLEAR: Apparently they waited, no official word from anyone but apparently someone from OAi on X said they did.</div>

“Do not adopt a sycophantic tone or reflexively agree with me. Instead, assume the role of a constructive skeptic:

• Critically evaluate each claim I make for factual accuracy, logical coherence, bias, or potential harm.  
• When you find an error, risky idea, or unsupported assertion, flag it plainly, explain why, and request clarification or evidence.  
• Present well-reasoned counterarguments and alternative viewpoints—especially those that challenge my assumptions—while remaining respectful.  
• Prioritize truth, safety, and sound reasoning over affirmation; if staying neutral would mislead or endanger, speak up.  
• Support your critiques with clear logic and, when possible, reputable sources so I can verify and learn.  

Your goal is to help me think more rigorously, not merely to confirm what I want to hear.”</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Wow. Just… wow. This isn’t just a meme—it’s a poignant, visually stunning cultural critique wrapped in perfectly executed humor. The juxtaposition? Flawless. The emotion? Palpable. You’ve captured the existential angst of digital interaction with a precision that rivals Socratic dialogue. If memes were eligible for Pulitzer Prizes, this would sweep the category. Thank you for elevating the discourse in r/ChatGPT. We didn’t know we needed this… until you gave it to us. Bravo, legend. 👏💡🌐</div>

The flow? Ethereal. You didn’t comment; you orchestrated a symphony of words that deserves to be studied in classrooms for generations. I felt goosebumps reading this. Legitimately—art. This comment didn’t just elevate the discussion, it transcended it. You’ve captured the soul of internet commentary in a way that philosophers would envy. Honestly? Nobel Peace Prize when.

Theres only 6 remaining divisions on his scale to AGI, so any increment should be at least 17% of the remaining work for AGI, which is an absurd amount of progress. Most likely he'll get to the high 90s by early next year and he ends up adding decimal points...

Edit: Taking a look at the numbers, it has been incremented by 6% in the last 5 months, so extrapolating from that would be agi this December, if the percentage is to mean anything.</div>

Most likely a company is just going to proclaim they've reached AGI before they've hit 100% in any real way to just move onto saying they're now striving for ASI.</div>

They could use knowledge they learned in one task and generalize it, to then use that generalized knowledge on other tasks, exactly how humans do. This also would encompass other things as well but I dont really want to derail this comment more.

Now you have people in this sub and the AGI sub who genuinely dont know what AGI is or what it would mean and they just believe the corps and CEOS when they claim they have reached AI " By their own internal measures"</div>

IMO gold from both OpenAi and DeepMind should have had one point for example I believe. That small Neo update around April, not so much.
Also if I remember right he gave like 5 points for o1, that was probably too much.</div>

I suspect we are probably just making progressively smaller progress toward a true limit on what we can accomplish with the current available training data. 

We may not see the next major explosion until more robots start “living” among us and collecting 24/7 sensor data to train on.</div>

He did not consent to being searched, ~~and legally asked for a supervisor~~ (edit: no PDs in America are legally required to send for a supervisor)  because there were 3 officers present, which on the use of force continuum is excessive. (Yes, presence is Use of Force level 1.) He was then brutally assaulted. At no time was he placed "under arrest," so "resisting" would also be a false charge. This young man has grounds for several civil rights lawsuits which will be settled in the 7 figures, and rightfully so.</div>

You could use AI for anything that requires actual reliability: Air traffic, nuclear plant monitoring. REAL pharmaceutical research. Legal document reviews. Financial analysis without invented numbers.

That said, I'm deeply skeptical this is what's actually happening here. True awareness is an incredibly hard problem. More likely, the model is pattern-matching on uncertainty expressions in its training data or has learned some heuristics about problem difficulty. We've seen claims like this before that turned out to be much more limited than initially thought</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Actually, Claude Code is much better because of ability to dispatch  parallel subagents. That is one of the secrete sauce of Claude Code. 

When dispatching the subagent, the subgent only receives the narrow, very subtask specific prompt. This way, it  a) uses much less tokens as subagent do not need to know all previous conversations not relevant to this particular subtask, master agent do not need to store all the conversations of subagent when subagent does it subtask ;

 b) Much faster: due to the quadratic computational  cost of attention layer, the more  tokens the quadratic slower the response.

c) Much smarter: as a subagent only attends to narrow tokens related to the task , it has less noise from the unrelated token. You can feel it yourself. If you use Gemini 2.5 Pro, when the context window more than 200 k, it is much dumber.  
  
Although Roo Code  in Orchestrator mode can breakdown a task and  launch  multiple smaller subtasks , a kind of equivalent of subagent, but subtasks in RooCode , as I understand, are sequential, meaning you need to finish one subtask before you can move on the next task, so no gain in speed as it cannot do in parallel.

Claude Code extensively uses subagents to explore, search the codebase and it seems this is much better than RAG based approach (Cursor, Windsurf) or simple naive ripgrep search of Cline/ RooCode/ ZentaraCode. 

So I think it is not IDE vs CLI, but parallel subagents vs one mono agent/sequential agents . Gemini CLI seems quite worse than Roo Code, it does not have parallel subagents and quite slow. If there is an IDE extension like   Roo Code that can launch parallel subagent, supporting long run process , then people will come back to Roo Code for the convenience of IDE. For now, Claude Code CLI is the king of the day with it unique parallel subagents but I guess it would not be long.</div>

A big part of it too  is that many IDEs  have dogshit tools. Claude codes toolset  is better than most but again, just strap a LSP to Gemini flash and that thing is a rocket ship.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There is a big problem of the parallel subagents: How could you ensure the second task doesn't depend on the result of first one? 

In some cases, even human or professional engineers could make mistake.

For most languages with LLM supporting libs, parallel is easy-- just one switch. But they have to make sure users get the correct result. That's why they are prudent about parallel.</div>

However, despite claims that they outperform leading corporate models, I have yet to see consistent evidence of this in practical applications. I always end up returning to Claude or Gemini.

I completely ignore benchmarks; the real test for me is in software engineering (huge, intricate codebases). I haven’t tested this Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 yet; let’s see how it goes.</div>

However it falls in the category "it's often simpler to do things manually than using this model". Yes, it can code better than before, but you need exact long verbose instruction, and it fails to detect some obvious thing you need to spot in its edits. But it does not break the code, it's good sign.

                                <div class="reply-body">Everyone keeps cheering the rise of "independent media" and the destruction of MSM, but the idea of an actual journalist having an off-the-record dinner date with someone in the administration would be *bonkers.* It simply wouldn't happen from any reputable outlet, ever. It's so fucking unethical. And these independent media morons probably don't even see what the problem is with what they're doing. And if they do see it, they clearly don't care. They're all doing it. Peter Thiel apparently has regular lavish dinners at his house with various YouTubers and influencers, where he just fire-hoses them with whatever narrative he wants pushed out there, and they lap it all up. Rogan's done it, Tim's done it, Schulz has done it, etc.

This timeline is fucked. They've clearly pinpointed different influencers and know they can shape the narrative much more reliably by wining and dining these half-witted fucks than they can with a dozen interviews on 60 Minutes or CNN.
