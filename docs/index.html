GPT is based on work done by Google, which has been working on "chat bot" and other AI technologies for a very long time. And also has developed it's own AI hardware.

OpenAI simply focused on this technology and made a commercial product sooner.

Google just shifted some resources to again overtake them, and has a whole bunch of other stuff in development.</div>

The lead has vanished in what is released. I am not saying they have something more powerful that they haven't released but they could be deep into work on the next big thing while the others are still doing something that gets just ahead of OpenAI's current stuff. A lot of OpenAI's releases of late have been updates and small tuning of what they already had/have. Others have jumped ahead, but they could be gunning for short term gains, as they don't want to be perceived as behind OpenAI. 

Where as OpenAI stole the spotlight, got what they needed in terms of funding and attention and perhaps are deep into doing something that is coming next, while trying to stay somewhat relevant on the surface.

These big models can take longer than 2 years, If the next big thing takes 3 years to make and OpenAI has already been working on it for two years, we just don't see it yet and OpenAI will jump back ahead and the others will struggle to catch up to that.

The truth is we don't know and really it doesn't matter, as long as we are getting stuff and they are pushing each other forward, both in availability to us all and how good it is.</div>

At the same time they just released o1, would they really already have o3 (basically o2) ready to go already? 

Hopefully not just a demo. Also wonder if we get Orion since the information makes it sound like that is the base model that gets post trained to become o3 possibly?</div>

From today's article:
&gt; Still, OpenAI intended to use a new pretrained model, Orion, to develop what became o3.

From August 27, 2024 The Information article https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-shows-strawberry-ai-to-the-feds-and-uses-it-to-develop-orion :
&gt;It isn’t clear whether a chatbot version of Strawberry that can boost the performance of GPT-4 and ChatGPT will be good enough to launch this year. The chatbot version is a smaller, simplified version of the original Strawberry model, known as a distillation. It seeks to maintain the same level of performance as a bigger model while being easier and less costly to operate.
&gt;
&gt;However, OpenAI is also using the bigger version of Strawberry to generate data for training Orion, said a person with knowledge of the situation. That kind of AI-generated data is known as “synthetic.” It means that Strawberry could help OpenAI overcome limitations on obtaining enough high-quality data to train new models from real-world data such as text or images pulled from the internet.

The improvements have been incremental vs the dramatic GPT3 to 4 shift and, frankly, we're at a point where improvements won't be as obvious with a vibe check. But take a step back and look at this, there's just no arguing, we've shot way way past the original GPT-4 model and at this point the gap between something like o1 and that GPT-4 model is probably comparable to 3 to 4</div>

However, due to a potential copyright or trademark conflict with O2, a British telecommunications service provider, OpenAI has considered calling the next update “o3” and skipping “o2,” these people said. Some leaders have referred to the model as o3 internally.The startup has poured resources into its reasoning AI research [following a slowdown in the improvements](https://archive.ph/o/84fve/https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-shifts-strategy-as-rate-of-gpt-ai-improvements-slows) it’s gotten from using more compute and data during pretraining, the process of initially training models on tons of data to help them make sense of the world and the relationships between different concepts. Still, OpenAI intended to use a new pretrained model, Orion, to develop what became o3. (More on that [here](https://archive.ph/o/84fve/https://www.theinformation.com/articles/goodbye-gpt-hello-reasoning-o).)OpenAI launched a preview of o1 in September and has found paying customers for the model in coding, math and science fields, [including fusion energy researchers](https://archive.ph/o/84fve/https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-everyone-is-underestimating-reasoning-models). The company recently started charging $200 per month per person to use ChatGPT that’s powered by an upgraded version of o1, or 10 times the regular subscription price for ChatGPT. Rivals have been racing to catch up; a Chinese firm [released a comparable model last month](https://archive.ph/o/84fve/https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-competitors-chase-openai-in-reasoning-ai-race), and Google on Thursday [released its first reasoning model publicly](https://archive.ph/o/84fve/https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/google-releases-ai-reasoning-preps-chatbot-in-search).</div>

All the tech innovation happened before Sundar pichai became CEO. This includes Waymo (google self driving car). Even all the failed Google attempts.

Before Sundar, Google were tackling and buying everything with a clear vision. Even buying boston dynamics. Then Sundar takes over and sells BD for scraps.

Fast forward years later and BOTS are now the frontier and tens of billions are being poured into it each year.

Google had the best BOT company in the world and sold it because the CEO had no vision for it and because "the youtube videos generated bad headlines".

Now everyone is working on bots and they have to partner. Again pointing towards a lack of vision by Sundar.</div>

Not only was he the main author of GPT as well as Dall-E, he probably spearheaded every important research direction at the company. He's equal if not more in influence than Ilya. This is a huge loss, there's no two ways of looking at it. For me it's quite a bear signal for OpenAI, but I am hoping now he can do some open research and publish stuff, so that the world overall can benefit. I don't think he will be GPU-poor like the rest of academia at any time in future.</div>

Submission Statement: A witness outside Atlantic City near New Jersey reported a strange and unexplained event yesterday involving a glowing orb in the sky and the scrambling of four F-16 fighter jets from a nearby squadron.

The witness, a former Air Force veteran with extensive knowledge of planes and drones, described the object as an extremely bright orb hovering approximately 25,000 feet in the sky.   
  
The phenomenon was first observed while the witness and a friend were talking in their front yard. The orb moved slowly toward their location before reversing direction after about 10 minutes, remaining visible for over an hour and a half before disappearing from sight.

I know you guys will downvote me for expressing my opinion, but it's not because I intend to minimize anything that's going on, but because I sometimes think it's important to hear a voice outside of your echo chamber.</div>

AARO:  there are no UAPs, it's all garbage and balloons and birds

Uh, what about those metallic orbs you just mentioned?

AARO: yeah, I guess there are some of those but really it's all garbage and balloons and birds

So...uh... are garbage and balloons and birds disrupting training exercises and closing airspace over our military assets or...

AARO:  there's a lot to look into and air safety is important.  Mostly it's garbage and balloons and birds tho, relax

What about the ones that aren't?

AARO:  they mostly are.


Replace AARO with fbi/dhs, and garbage with airplanes and here we are.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/MAFMalcom:

I already put my description in the post, so I will quote it here for my submission statement:

"With all of these videos and photos of "focused energy" and "biblically accurate angels" I feel everyone should take a second and watch this video. They demonstrate how stars can look like all of those plasma orb posts due to the light not being fully focused and pollution in the air causing distortions. I am a believer in NHI, but please educate yourself before blasting that it is the end of times."

Hopefully, that is at least 150 characters, as I am too lazy to check.

&gt; *SUV size ‘drone’ in the sky tonight at dinner tonight on the roof at Funke in Bev Hills this massive UAP flew in a pattern stopping.. scanning.. fast flying fast stopping… scanning over and over for what looked like a mile. No sound.. no buzzing or whirling of engines or propellers. Not sure if it was actually scanning but it seemed to be sorta I don’t know “looking” for something. Black mirror come to life.*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; *Dane Jeffrey Cook (born March 18, 1972) is an American stand-up comedian and film actor. He is known for his use of observational, often vulgar, and sometimes dark comedy. He released six comedy albums: Harmful If Swallowed (2003), Retaliation (2005), Vicious Circle (2006), Rough Around the Edges: Live from Madison Square Garden (2007), and Isolated Incident (2009).*

&gt; *He is one of the first comedians to use a personal webpage and Myspace to build a large fan base, and in 2006 was described as "alarmingly popular". Cook starred in numerous films such as Employee of the Month (2006), Good Luck Chuck (2007), and My Best Friend's Girl (2008). He also acted in Mystery Men (1999), Waiting... (2005), Dan in Real Life (2007), Mr. Brooks (2007) and provided the lead voice role in the 2013 animated sports comedy film Planes, and its 2014 sequel Planes: Fire &amp; Rescue as Dusty Crophopper.*

&gt; *He was the second comedian (after Andrew Dice Clay) to sell out Madison Square Garden's large arena space. In 2006, Retaliation became the highest-charting comedy album in 28 years and went platinum. He performed an HBO special in late 2006, Vicious Circle, a straight-to-DVD special titled Rough Around The Edges (which is included in the album of the same name), and a Comedy Central special in 2009 titled Isolated Incident.*

                        <div class="reply-body">So I’m now fairly certain I saw one of these drones last Thursday night in Philadelphia. 

It flew over my neighborhood at about 10,000-12,000 feet. Could’ve easily been mistaken for a plane, but the cadence of the lights was unusual. The lights on the “wings” would flash green, at 3 and 9 o clock, and then the front and tail would flash red, at 12 and 6 o clock. 

That, apparently, is the exact light pattern that witnesses are describing, and it didn’t match up with the cadence that I saw from conventional aircraft in the area. Drones sightings were reported in my neighborhood that night too, via the Citizen app.

Hi there, my friend send me this video. 
I immediately asked for context. She was sitting by herself near the edge of the water meditating. And she noticed the green light appearing in the distance. She then took out her phone and started recording. That's where we jump in, her reaction says it all. Her first idea is, maybe divers? But I'm interested if this might be a unidentified submerged object. Looking forward to hearing your opinion!

It seems that next year will be a year of great revelations and importance for the global UFO community!

Looks like this coming year is going to be a great year! 


The phenomena are intensifying and spreading rapidly to other parts of the world.


In Portugal, for example, UAPs are being reported in droves, emerging from the ocean coast.


Video records of these demonstrations have attracted attention there.


I believe we will have great revelations towards the end of this year and throughout the year 2025 onwards. 🛸👽

I think you and others like yourself showing up on these subs looking for answers is evidence in and of itself of a) the government disinformation campaign not passing your sniff tests and b) you are unnerved by what's happening - which is especially concerning given the background you've pointed to in federal law enforcement.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/paranormalnapolska:

---

Yesterday's article from Portuguese CNN described extraordinary events recorded in Sagres and Cascais. Dozens of spheres of light appeared in the sky, visible to the naked eye, with shapes and behaviors that remain unexplained. Notably, a man described them as emerging from the sea.

To the recent reports from Poland, the USA, the United Kingdom, Greece, and Ukraine, Portugal now joins the list. It’s intriguing to consider how many similar cases remain unreported.

Many C130 circling the waters off the Jersey shore night after night. Pegasus flying low and slow through interior New England. I am a USAF vet and I didn't understand these flight patterns. The numerous tankers didn't make sense, they are expensive to keep in the air.</div>

That being said, as a daily observer of ADSB Exchange, military traffic has been greater than normal, especially during evenings and nights. Notably, the number of P8s, R-135s, C-17s, and especially tankers flying during odd hours has increased.

This is completely anecdotal.</div>

                    <div class="comment-body">I had a soldier that "caught shrapnel" in his cheek while we were in Afghanistan. Ironically enough, we were attached to 7th Special Forces Group, Tim's old unit. It seemed so relatively minor that we really didn't think much of it, but the team's medic (18D) was very adamant about making sure that it gets a second look at the aid station when we RTB (return to base). 

Turns out, my soldier had a 7.62 bullet stuck in his face, from an apparent ricochet; which is why we thought it was just a bit of shrapnel or that he hit his face on something during the fight. That soldier got a purple heart for all that, and it's largely because that 18D was so adamant about doing his job.

I say all that to make a point: I don't for one fucking second believe that Tim Kennedy had shrapnel "millimeters away from his carotid artery," or that his 18D saw it and didn't care, nor did that medic make a point to examine it later to make sure it wasn't the mechanism of injury for something more serious. If any of his story was true, he would have a purple heart. He would have something, ANYTHING that would resemble a Valor award. But he doesn't even have an ARCOM with a V device, let alone a valorous Bronze Star. (An end of deployment Bronze Star is fundamentally different than one with a V device)</div>

Growing up, there was a guy in our neighborhood who was a Delta Force operator. The man looked like an in-shape Ned Flanders, super nice, always friendly, and always willing to help if you needed your car or bike fixed. Occasionally, after a barbecue cookout and drinks, he might casually mention a trip to the south of the border or some Cambodian jungle, but he never bragged or talked openly about it.

Then there was this Vietnam vet who used to spin wild stories about being deep cover in the jungle. Turns out he was a recruiter who got dishonorably discharged. The more people talk, the more BS they’re usually full of.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">i spent 8 years in the army as an infantryman.  stationed at fort lewis for the bulk of it, barracks right down the road from 2nd ranger battalion and we ran into those guys all the time, partied with them and  they partied with us, etc.  ended up making a lot of good lifelong friends and through them was introduced to a few guys from 1st group.  long story short, actually being in the combat arms community and knowing a lot of the "cool guy" dudes you realize a few things when you get out: a lot of people are extremely full of shit about their service record when someone they didn't serve with isn't there to put them in check.

the amount of navy seals and operators that i have met outside the military would make you think there are thousands upon thousands of these dudes and its common.</div>

Even if it was just a regular military career it’s still pretty cool since obviously he didn’t have to do it. But his ego or whatever it is made him think he had to be fucking Rambo and be the most bad ass guy out there and here we are.</div>

Honestly I just wanna watch him and Lee throw down bong hits and listen to music like they used to do on Periscope.

I've been watching these, but I don't finish them like I used to. I usually get bored and click off within 30 minutes.

He preaches like he thinks we can learn something from him because of the way he grew up when in reality, the world he grew up in just doesn't fkin exist anymore.</div>

I was just getting into my first post-college job and needed some things to listen to at work, so I found Rogan in like 2014, then would listen to Joey, TFATK, StarTalk, and a couple others in that realm.

Crazy to see how far this has all come, and Uncle Joey sort of steered away from the whole podcasting new generation, which I think is a good thing</div>

Move your pointer finger and  follow a line from one side to the other. 

The colours under your moving finger "changed".  The rug did not.  Your moving finger represents consciousness.  The rug represents the multiverse.  The stain on the rug is nothing , ignore that, it looks like cum but it isn't.</div>
