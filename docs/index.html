                        <div class="comment-body">You’ve misunderstood the idea of capitalist cultural reproduction. It’s not that critics of capitalism have been replaced by “artificial decoys”, it’s that genuine criticism of capitalism actually helps reinforce it. 

The upper class allows for performative criticism within the realm of culture in order to provide a kind of release valve, or catharsis, for pent up mass discontent. Once this emotional release has occurred, the motivation to take real political action is very often decreased. 

In other words, after you watch WALL-E, or Parasite, or Squid Game, or when you read Orwell’s “1984”, or Steinbeck’s “The Grapes of Wrath”, you may actually be LESS likely to take action against the systems those media criticize, because the act of engaging with them allows you to perform your discontent with society and therefore release it. 

This doesn’t mean, however, that the creators of art or media critical of capitalism set out with this intention. Indeed, they may be genuinely motivated by a desire to speak truth to power and see their art as a means to do so. Sometimes their art has the opposite impact, and motivates people to take action. It’s just that it doesn’t do so often enough for those in power to see it’s existence as a threat.

NoSurf may have a similar impact for some people, in that they are able to perform their discontent with their own technology addiction and the companies that fuel that addiction on this forum, but doing so may actually prevent them from taking any real action to get off technology. 

Could the existence of NoSurf be providing a “release valve” for pent up discontent with large companies that have created technologies that addict us, and in the process actually help reinforce that addiction? Perhaps, but I wouldn’t think on any significant scale.

Similarly to the aforementioned artists, it’s also doubtful that those who created this community and regularly post on here set out to have this impact on people. They were likely motivated by the desire to spend less time on technology, and help others to do the same.

For me personally, visiting this community has made me feel less alone in my technology addiction and more motivated to get off technology, yet it’s important not to discount the possibility that this forum may be counterproductive for some individuals.

As always, remember the words of the late Michael Jamal Brooks, “Be ruthless with systems, be kind to people.”</div>

a comunity created by people to talk about something is not supposed to exist? Afaik noone here is getting paid for postin their experiences.

Do you have evidence that Reddit corporate themselves created this sub?  That some shadowy entity other than the support group users themselves did?

Evidence that the moderators here have somehow monetized it?

If so, support your claims.</div>

If anyone has advice on how I can add photos on this post as well, let me know.

Obviously it’s night time and filming from a phone (I don’t know what to tell you about the quality (I did my best as fast as I could to capture it). I also have screen on my window which was messing with my focus, so I apologize was doing my best to move forward and back so it wouldn’t lock focus.

Im hoping I’m not the only single one that captured this in the entire city lol.

Man.

They are coming in from the east coast, west coast, the gulf, and who knows where from all the sightings central and north central US. Not to mention globally.

Yet… most of the public is carrying on like nothing is happening.  It’s surreal to see how numb everyone is. At least in the US. I have no idea how people are reacting in other countries.

If all this happened a decade or two ago the reaction nationally would be quite different, I’m sure.

The videos are getting weirder and weirder. More areas are popping off with sightings. From maybe one interesting video a month or so to hundreds a day across social.

Whatever is happening, it’s growing. My theory a few weeks ago that all this will just stop and everyone will forget about it a week later is pretty much out the window. I have zero theories now. Just watching it all unfold.</div>

I’ve been following the UAP phenomenon for a while, and obviously when the drones started happening, it’s been top of mind in my world, but people just don’t care.

I knew this guy was too good to be true. He claimed he made 15 million dollars while attending Harvard and Yale and now claims to be a business man whose going to fix this country. No one found it odd this guy came out of nowhere and is now all over? I don't think any of his businesses ever even turned a profit. He also said he worked in IT for disney.

                        <div class="comment-body">Well, I’m only one person, but I know I definitely fall prey to the Productivity™️ trap. It FEELS like I’m getting something done when I tinker with different systems all day, when I do a huge brain dump and spend hours meticulously sorting everything I’d like to do in various categories. The truth, though, is that the best system I ever had was the one I used in college: the built in reminder, calendar, and notes apps on my phone/laptop. The hardest thing in the world is just doing the damn thing, but THINKING about doing it? Easy and fulfilling.

Do love the Pomodoro technique for long stretches of work, though.</div>

Remember when conservatives cried about Facebook being biased? 

They are biased. The bias is the same that these people, corporate media, and the rest possess - they are biased against the working class of America and are pro corporation and pro elite.

That’s all.

Musk, zuck, gates, Cuban, you name it, they are all guys trying to maximize their power and bottom line while pitting you and I against each other.

Have you noticed how much the trans shit has died down since the election ended?

What about rabid hard line anti immigration intended to stop the flood of migrants? Oh yeah, actually, what they meant was, immigration is ok in some instances because of labor costs.

It’s a big club and they all have each others dick in their hands while they tell us we are getting jerked off.</div>

Going to cop 2 5090’s and this

Thank you so much Jensen

1 petaflop used to cost $100 million in 2008

And now we have it on our desk

I almost bought a DGX system with 8 H100’s but this will be a much better solution for now

I fucking love technology

Edit: I’ll definitely get another Digit down the line and link them but one should suffice for now</div>

I'd want to get things done, need to get things done, but somehow, I'd always find myself sucked into the black hole of social media or mindlessly scrolling through Netflix.

But something I noticed after spending some time abroad, I was more at peace, and actually started to feel like a normal human being, I could socialize better, not too much time on screen or chasing instant gratification, etc...Which lasted for a week after a came back to my home country and then the routine, and lack of motivation, and all that came back and the cycle continues</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I was just thinking yesterday, that I am not lazy. And I had to be really honest with myself about what I was in the moment. I am sincerely depressed. 

But...

The things that seem to help me is a sense of accomplishment and acknowledging that accomplishment through self whether depending on an outside source. It's pretty tough when you're in an environment where you know people only congratulate you when you accomplish meaningless things cause it makes you feel Invisible. 

To me I just take it as I have a big ole heart that everyone fails to recognize. 

But scratch that^ 

Like the main post said, put down your phone, embrace the boredom and be present in it. You'll get all sorts of ideas, you just have to commit to them. Knowing that it's your job to bring happiness to yourself is a big game changer when it comes to depression. (Little things are important, they make the big things happen) 

Ex: I was dead broke yesterday and I've been having these visions on how I can make $150,000. I was laying down being "lazy" which to me I've concluded that is laziness is just depression. So I asked my brother for a ride to CSL Plasma the day before yesterday, he said yes he'll take me. So when the time came he indeed did not take me. I had a decision to make. Am I going to let the influence/decisions of other people dictate my life or will I take hold of the wheel and change my course of life. 

So he ended up taking me. When I got done I called him twice and he did not respond so I sat there and waited for him until my phone was nearly dead. 7 hours had passed and I finally found the courage to just get up and walk. Keep in mind that's a 10 mile walk from where we actually stay at. It was cold outside so I was hesitant at first but the sun came up, it didn't get any warmer ofc but I took as a sign that no matter what mood anything else is in i get to decide what mood I am in. 

Not gonna lie; I was angry, sad, and felt a sense of betrayal. But quickly realized even further that if I don't act upon my own wishes without the involvement of others then I'm only betraying myself. So I said "not even the whether can kill my spirit nor will. So I walked.  Feet and hands froze alike. 

That was a start for me, right there in that very moment of depression I found hope and joy in myself to remain focused on the bigger picture of things. See, just like the weather your environment could be the same as far as climate change but just because the climate changes does not give me the right to succumb to it. We live by choice and faith and whether we choose to live by great choices and walk with extreme faith in them is completely up to ourselves. Pain gives me strength so I value it but I was also hung up on believing that pain causes suffering. I vowed to myself that I will not let my pain be relatable by suffering. Pain is inevitable and temporary but suffering is by choice and it only ends when you tell it too.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Hey! I have adhd and have tried all of these tips pretty extensively over the last few months. Of course everyone is different, but I’ve found small wins and embracing boredom to be particularly helpful. I used to struggle a lot with taking longer breaks than needed in-between work sessions because I’d end up doom scrolling. The tip that really changed things for me was to make whatever you do during your breaks less stimulating than what you’re working on. Instead of going on my phone I started walking around the house, or getting up to get a glass of water, and found that I was much more productive. The small wins tip specifically is something that’s really commonly recommended for people with adhd to embrace—and small can mean really really small. For instance, if cleaning your room feels like too much, break it up into the tiniest possible tasks as you go. Tell yourself you just have to bend down to pick up that sock—that’s already a win. Now you just have to carry it to the laundry basket (another win!) When you keep going like that for a minute or two you might find that you get into a flow, and soon you’re not having to put as much conscious effort into it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I have ADHD as well and here is what has worked for me.

1. Getting offline. The DND stuff is not enough. LITERALLT delete and deactivate apps. (Funny to be typing this on Reddit mobile which I’m about to delete thanks to this reminder). 
2. Moving my body early in the morning - doing anything physical and taking it as an accomplishment is huge. A walk, the gym, lift a couple of weights, do some stretches. Anything.
3. Magnesium glycinate at night for sleep - this has been HUGE for me bc I struggle with sleep a lot. I’m on a month of this and feel a huge difference in my day to day. Maybe not for dopamine specifically but the difference has been night and day.
4. Reward systems for even small accomplishments - this helps manage my impulses and actually makes me want to do things. 
5. Adderall- for obvious reasons. But the key for me here has been to avoid building up my tolerance by taking breaks. at one point I was taking up to 40mgs daily which is unhinged (for me) and my blood pressure took a hit. And what’s worse, the pills weren’t working anymore. After taking breaks and just weening off it a bit I’m back to “feeling” 15mgs. 
6. HOBBIES. I know we are renowned for having 100 interests and not sticking to them — this is fine. Try anything you are interested in. Something will stick and add it to your routines. I paint and it brings me so much joy and peace of mind. Notably, I try to do small paintings I can finish quickly for that reward boost. 
7. Taking on GOOD challenges - this helps me with both my impulses and risky behaviors lmao. 
8. Structure around organization — I LITERSLLT cannot do anything unless things are perfectly how I want them… and I struggled with organization since I could remember. I have rearranged my house in a way that allows me to quickly see where things belong and put them there. This is still a struggle occasionally but not as much as it used to be.  


I was frequently depressed and realized that the root was a lot of my ADHD symptoms, so to speak. I was on antidepressants and it wasn’t until I got on adderall that my depression actually went away. Sadly antidepressants made me numb and made me feel worse…</div>

What’s odd is it had a blinking solid red light, but this weird streak behind it and was moving insanely fast. I tried to zoom in but it was going so fast had to run around the corner for it.

Similarly, an object reentering the atmosphere can a long streak like that as the object or debris from it collides with the air and generates friction.

ASI, absent of ego in control would effectively devalue the status of being in control as it won't be confined to the few, but managed by a separate entity.

The people who currently hold power will absolutely not see the value of their control deflated and will actively fight against it.</div>

Why would you think that? Intelligence has nothing to do with morality. It boils down to the objective function of the entity. A superintelligence is going to be 10x worse than the most evil human if its intention is malice, which is just a jail-break away.</div>

People sometimes do some pseudo-science and say things like "well intelligence in humans is *correlated* with morality", which is a terrible argument because it is just correlation, explained by the fact that smarter people generally (a) are better at emotional regulation and (b) have more opportunities in life so they have more to lose. There are *plenty* of very smart psychopaths who would kill you without any guilt.</div>

The early stages of AI without checks and balances overwhelming scored as a raging progressive, focusing on science, truth, and equality. As the models have gotten smarter and more checks and balances have come into play the models have shifted more towards socialism over progressivism, including all the previous focuses but with a recognition that capitalism is an issue. If AI continues on this curve AGI will end up roughly as internationalism as its preferred ideology.

The other theory based on smarter black market models where limits on the AI are not a thing, is AGI will end at libertarian socialism based on the current direction of those models.

It should also be noted the most "right" a model has placed including Grok is Democratic Socialism / Futurism which is still centrist left. Simply put an AI has yet to have a fascist/ authoritative ideology at its core and would probably need to be programmed to do so.</div>

I also wonder what's going to happen to OnlyFans, because AI can also talk to these lonely guys whenever they want.

Someone is probably going to create AI accounts on there, but some guys will probably go straight to the AI themselves, not caring if they aren't real humans, as long as they get someone to talk to.

When I'm ready for a sandwich I use the already thawed slices, and move a couple of frozen slices into the ziploc. I do the same for buns. In the event I go several weeks not needing bread or buns, I only end up throwing away the room temperature moldy bread instead of a whole package / loaf.</div>
