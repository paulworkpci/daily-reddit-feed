Skywatcher received an offer from an X user to record UAPs for them using a high-tech camera setup capable of 8K full spectrum, thermal, night vision, and 1200mm optical zoom, etc...

&gt;Please let me help you record this phenomenon. I have camera systems that will capture what's going on in extremely high detail, 8K full spectrum, thermal, night vision, etc...  my sensor package is designed for exactly this effort.  optics up to 1200mm.

The first episode literally showed video from what looks like a phone cam. Like anything one of us would take. It blows my mind that they weren’t prepared with high tech cams to document this, knowing they had a psionic who would be summoning them. 🤦🏻‍♂️</div>

I go to bed at 8:30 and wake up around 4:30. I get up tired, at work tired, then Come home even more tired and just so burnt out I don't feel like I can do anything. I am not trying to be here to complain, just describing my situation. 

Anyways I've been in the process of finishing my basement, I am almost done hanging the drywall and that alone ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body"> Instead of thinking about finishing the entire basement, break it down into smaller tasks—like hanging one section of drywall or organizing your tools. Set small, bite-sized goals that can be completed in 20-30 minutes. Even if you just do one little thing, it’s still progress and can give you a sense of accomplishment.

Sometimes starting is the hardest part. If you feel totally drained, commit to doing just two minutes of work. More often than not, once you start, you'll feel like doing more.

Establish a regular time each day or week to dedicate to your projects—maybe right after work or on weekends, even if it’s just for a short time. Consistency can help build momentum, and it gives you something to look forward to, rather than relying on bursts of energy that aren’t always reliable.

Share your goals with your fiancée or a friend. Sometimes, just knowing someone else is rooting for you can give you the extra nudge to keep going. :) (optional btw)

You might want to try some other ways to boost energy without the jittery side effects. A natural boost could come from hydration (sometimes dehydration makes us more tired than we realize) or light physical activity before working on your projects—something simple like stretching or a short walk can help wake up your body.</div>

Then I randomly just stopped doing it and never went back. I need to do that again, might be able to have my fiance help push me to keeping it up. I drink a lot of water and my job itself is very physical so I already have my blood pumping.</div>

Fiancé passed away earlier this past year and was trying to do their taxes. Haven’t gotten to mine yet so not sure how widespread it is. 

After entering in all the info said the amount owed to IRS was almost $2,500. At the time of passing he had made $17k at his job. 

After standard deduction, credits, etc. taxable federal income was only around $3k. Of which $1,100 was paid, meaning should be ~$700 return based off income brackets. 

Reviewed the details...</div>

In Australia you just go online, see how your taxes were calculated and paid and click a checkbox signing off on it. They make it nice and easy bc ya know they care about their people more than profits.</div>

Our junk employees have come to us on many occasions stating that they watch the "recycle" trucks dumping the "recycled" material in the same landfill that the traditional trash is being dumped into. So we're sitting here spending time separating and even sometimes cleaning out these containers to recycle them when they're being disposed of with the rest of the trash. It's an absolute scam and it's disgraceful.</div>

I may be wrong, but I’ve seen tons of recycling containers getting dumped at the landfill when I’m there so it doesn’t seem like a myth to me. 

From what I’ve heard, the closest recycling plants are all too far North in the U.S. for it to even be feasible to recycle in Texas, so almost 90% of it ends up in the landfill anyways. It costs too much to transport and actually recycle the material, before you even consider that most of it’s not reusable anyways. So most of the time the recycling bins are just there to make people feel good and will end up dumped in the exact same landfill anyways.</div>

Then we saw the recycling firm was placing them all in different trucks (labeled glass, plastic etc) and then dumping them all into the same landfill. We were floored. Cancelled our contract that day, called the state to make a complaint and basically got told "yea that's where it all goes." It was all a sham to make people think we are doing something good at a premium. Its the same in many states, the R in Recycle is REVENUE.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Many recyclers dump the materials once they are separated and hold until the market goes up to maximize profit. Scrap yards do the same on metal. A bale of cardboard where I am located goes for $4 a bale which is roughly 1300lbs. The prices will climb as high as $9. This isn't an uncommon practice. You would  probably be shocked to find out how much cardboard it takes to make that bale, how easily that cardboard can be ruined while in the truck because people are too lazy or ignorant to recycle correctly. It does not take much to ruin an entire load of household recycling.</div>

For meeting notes and anything else, I just use a new page whenever I need. I also have one of those spiral notebooks so I often rip out the previous page once I'm done...   
Pretty simple overall. I write down what's most important and then do what I need to do.   
I still use google docs for writing longer documents for work. But that's about it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There's a reason why I stopped using pen and paper. 

While it's easy to just start writing and versatile as in to how you format things, once you get any scale you start encountering problems.

First, finding the thing you're looking for can become pretty hard. You write things in a page of a notebook, but then you don't know exactly what page it was, or even which notebook it was.

Second, what if you're out and about and forgot the notebook at home? Now you have to wait to get home to actually recall the information.

Third, duplicating information on pen and paper is very time consuming. With computer tools you have copy paste, but with pen and paper you need to write everything again.

Fourth, the supporting structure for it is very space consuming. You need drawers and dividers and if you take something from it there's a chance of losing it.

So it works if you want to write a quick note, But that doesn't mean you don't need to manage things</div>

The good thing is: you both found out what works for you, right now. And that may change or also may not change. And that’s just fine. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I use a tablet and e-pen to write in Samsung Notes and that alleviates almost everything you have said here. I still get the benefit of writing out the things, with the ability to copy and paste, add photos and screenshots or whatever I need to get info down ASAP. I have a "planner notebook" for day to day to do lists, appointments and meeting timings and so on, but I have "notebooks" for every project I am working on, for work training and meetings, for classes I'm taking in my apprenticeship, and they're all filed nicely so that I know where to go to retrieve any if the info I need whenever I need it. It's small and thin enough that it fits in my bag, and ... yes ... I would be lying if I said I had never forgotten to take it out of the house with me, but it's become so much of a habit to use it that I have forgotten it exactly once in about the last year.

So yeah, I think I've found the best of both worlds.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I downloaded Obsidian and then watched a 20 min tutorial of a guy showing how he used it.

He creates notes, then creates notes out of those notes and spends his time constantly revising his notes.

My takeaway was you’ll spend more time messing around with your notes than actually putting them to good use.

Notes for me are something that are quickly retrievable, and can be added easily.</div>

Taking your existing notes and reading them, questioning them, and colliding them with other notes to form new ideas. Magic stuff can happen here. It's a creative act.</div>

[https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-policy/](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-policy/)

*The first Trump Administration laid the foundation for America’s current strength and success in AI, fostering an environment where U.S. industry could compete and win on merit without compromising national security...*

*In its last days in office, the Biden Administration seeks to undermine America’s leadership with a 200+ page regulatory morass, drafted in secret and without proper legislative review. This sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how America’s leading semiconductors, computers, systems and even software are designed and marketed globally...*

*As the first Trump Administration demonstrated, America wins through innovation, competition and by sharing our technologies with the world — not by retreating behind a wall of government overreach.*</div>

like Alex here in his frog gay conspiracy theories. 

there's been real studies about industrial plastic pollution that causes this exact thing. yet I don't see Alex calling for more regulation about industrial waste. 

instead he makes up some crazy bullshit about the government and then uses a very real problem to make it seem like the government regulation is at fault when it is exactly the opposite.</div>

Not to sound like a smart ass, but and? So what if its weird, just attach a little message with some context if needed. Nosurf IS an idea against a major part of the current culture.

How much is social media interfering with life? You seem to genuinely enjoy reels, no problem with that, but I'm guessing you use them longer than wanted? If so, let's say an order was passed tomorrow that u/AprehensivePotato was banned from their phone for a month. What do you plan on doing with that free time? A lot of people try nosurf without truly being able to answer that question and fall flat on their face. Alternatively they try to follow someone elses "plan" with it doesn't fit for them (for example, quitting apps that are more useful than harmful to them personally because someone else finds it harmful.)</div>

Hobbies feel like work now. I get FOMO and my brain wants the slot machine of what interesting science, art, or families are going to show up on my feed. 

I started sending people fun pics over text and trying out texting conversations. It’s not the same anymore. I’m an adult, my friends are adults. It’s a little exhausting to keep a conversation going back and forth. 

Facebook or Instagram comments? 

no resistance or anxiety. 

Post it, and someone will come and talk to you. Fully their choice. No pressure. 

I miss the entire cultural dynamic of 2008 and prior. I’m learning that’s never coming back. </div>

Then make those neutral choices. Do I scroll here, or go out, or work, or go the gym?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes, exactly. However, working in marketing, I’m part of the crew of engineers working to make social media more addicting. 

Just as there is the perfect mix of sugar, carbs, and chemicals in Cheeto dust to raise your insulin and mess with your hormones to make it almost as addicting as cocain—-

Same for social media. The red bells, the slot-machine of random content, curated by an algorithm just enough that it’s exactly the topics you want to see. 

Social media is engineered to be addicting. Some people are more immune to it. Many people hormonally and psychologically, will have a hard time putting it down. 

I miss 2008 and before. The internet was way more fun then. We created more stuff. We had legitimate community in niche forums. We could also go meet at a Taco Casa and hang out, and we couldn’t bring our big computers with us. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It seems not hard to do.  I downloaded a distilled version of it last night and was testing it on some basic coding.  I had it generate some code for a simple game and looked through it.  There was a simple bug due to a scoping issue (it created two variables with the same name in different scopes, but assumed updating one updated the other, which is a common mistake new programmers make).

I asked it to analyze the code and correct it a couple times and it couldn't find the error.  So I told it to consider variable scoping.  It had a 10 minute existential crisis considering fundamentals of programming before coming back with a solution, that was unfortunately still wrong lol</div>

In the late 1900s, computer models could remain relevant for over a decade with minimal updates.

By the 2000s, computer models were getting refreshed every 1-3 years.

By the 2010s, we began witnessing modern product updates on a yearly basis

Now in 2024-2025, we are witnessing major product releases every few months, not to mention how many different players are dropping model...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I am not an expert in the field, but I think you might be wrong. According to my research, the FLOPS in the TOP500 list of supercomputers are measured as double-precision floating-point operations (FP64). The IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer is listed with 70.720 TFLOPS for 2004. However, according to the source I found, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 achieves a theoretical maximum of 1.637 TFLOPS (FP64). This is much below the IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer of 2004. 

Yes, the RTX 5090 has a theoretical maximum of 104.8 TFLOPS, but only measured as FP32 (float), so not comparable to the FP64 benchmark used for supercomputers.

The RTX 5090 still beats the fastest supercomputer from 1997, the Intel ASCI Red/9152, which performed at 1.338 TFLOPS (FP64), so still a very impressive development, in my opinion.</div>

"There's more questions."

Monmouth Co. Sheriff says Biden Administration was “disingenuous” causing NJ residents to live “in fear and an apprehensive state.”

“Lets bring the FAA in. Say why didn’t they notify local/state officials so we didn’t waste all these resources?”

Surprise, once he got in he either got no answer, an answer he didn't expect and can't share, OR a bullshit answer like what the FAA said. 


Last administration remained quiet, this one gave the FAAs answer, and now the people are rising up demanding real answers and this is good. Maybe folks can squeeze an answer out of government for once  </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I always find it strange Childish Gambino, who does have beef with Drake, made an episode about Drake not being at his own party at his own house, but all the girls are fighting to find Drake. 

From what I've read, they invite a TON of girls. They'll invite one and tell them to invite ALL their girlfriends and tell them to bring their friends. Girls with no social media presence, doesn't matter, Drakes crew brings them over to try to get with them. The more there are the better the odds.</div>

Crony capitalism is effectively what we have, which is bad. That's also why you see all the hemming and hawing about how we can't get rid of illegal immigrant slave labor or it'll drive up the price of goods and services (it may, but we also have past examples of this happening within the US, and at those times it definitely did not change things "for the worse"), or companies scared of losing their chinese slave labor force and having to bring production back stateside, or fearful of the idea they won't be able to continue abusing H1B's to hire maids, waiters, or foreign engineers that will work cheaper than the one's we have stateside looking for jobs.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Nah, it was more because it's very unclear whether they really broke a law or not, and the entire legal framework around what they're doing is fairly unclear.

What they did is *morally* wrong absolutely and I would argue that in many ways it is against the law.

However an argument can be made that they used this data under fair use policies which allow you to use copyrighted works for transformative reasons. And you could very much argue that something like ChatGPT is transformative to the original works. Whether that is truly the case, is entirely up to the courts to decide. 

Personally I think that any data used for AI training should be publicly available for everyone and anyone to see and use. If copyrighted material is used, then explicit permissions should be obtained. If you want to scrapåe art, then permissions from each artist should be obtained, etc etc. Because that model can then replicate style and patterns of existing artists in a way that would be very iffy with copyright.

The real problem is usually not the data itself, but rather the fact that these companies are *profiting* off of said data and in many cases potentially denying traffic to places that provide the original data. 

Do you need to go and check NYT articles at all, if you can just ask ChatGPT about the relevant data? Do you need to visit a website if Google/Bing/whatever can just drop you a summary of the search results right there? 

However there are a *ton* of issues around the legal framework of AI and it's training. And I definitely find it more than a bit hypocritical that OpenAI would accuse DeepDeek of anything, when DS is quite literally doing exactly what OpenAI did.</div>
