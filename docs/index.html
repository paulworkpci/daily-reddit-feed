With that said, I do think all companies ought to be held to the same level of scrutiny on this, it’s not like you can ask OpenAI to give up its competitive edge and not expect the same of xAI and Google.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Can I be real with y’all? We just got an insane SOTA image generation model with high rate limits for $20 a month. They are probably burning absurd amounts of cash to make that possible.

I don’t see all the fuss when you can either spend $20 a month for increasingly uncensored outputs that come in 1 minute with few limits, vs $10,000 on an inference machine that takes 5 minutes or 10 minutes for the same output.

I’m not saying open source doesn’t have a place, it obviously does. But what I’m saying is I don’t understand the constant bitching when you are constantly getting new SOTA for the same price over 2 years and ever more if you are a free user. The major corps are just letting you use their inference machines for basically free.</div>

I constantly find myself fidgeting, changing positions, standing up to grab something (that I probably don’t even need) or just trying to get comfortable in my chair because somehow every position feels wrong after 5 minutes

I work from home and thinking about standing desk maybe better chair or even walking pad? Would love to hear what works for others routines, cheapy tools, hacks, anything. 

Any tips would seriously help. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Pen. Paper. 6-sided die.

Make a list of six tasks. Assign time limits (5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 mins) and a break(15 mins) to the die. I mix up the times to keep it interesting. If rolling a 2 was always 15 mins, it would get dull for me.

Roll for a task. Then roll for a time limit. If you get a break you have to do the task for 30 mins after. If you roll 45 or 60 mins, take an automatic 15 min break after the task. Otherwise, take a 5 min break before your next task. Roll until all tasks are done.

Complete 3 tasks and get a prize roll. Roll odd or even like a coin flip to get an extra snack, reddit break, or bonus video games later.

Hope this helps some folks.</div>

What do you do in a case where you have more time than needed to complete a task. Say you roll 60 minutes but it only takes 20 because of the nature of the task. Just treat it like a shorter time (5 min break) and keep rolling?</div>

For example, I mainly use "now" "today" "at some point" "this week" and it keeps my head focused on the "now" tasks, i can press a button and it'll clear any tasks I've ticker and reorganise tasks in order of priority.

For the construction aspects it was almost entirely local labor who would ordinarily wear flip flops.  Because it was a US military base they had to follow US safety rules where that wasn't allowed.  The general contractor provided socks &amp; steel toe work boots to all of the local laborers.  They ended up having significant delays because so many of the local were getting debilitating blisters to the point that they had to take time off due to what were considered workplace injuries.</div>

I worked construction in Dubai and would see some mad shit daily.

Bravest was a guy sat on the floor holding a maybe 1 inch square piece of tile (was part of some mosaic thing) in between his two feet, bottom of his feet facing each other with the piece sandwiched between, knees down to the side if that makes sense. Using a small angle grinder (with safety guards removed ofc) to take a bit of material off the tile. One slip and that cutting disk is going straight into his dick and balls</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My friends and I were heavily into photography and were super social. We would often do photo shoots and take the coolest photos.  It was so much fun seeing what the other came up with when they posted the photos on Facebook—It felt like we were all documenting our adventures together. We got so creative! I love fashion. I would help my friends pick out a cute outfit and do their makeup for some of these shoots. I loved capturing their beauty and the beauty in social moments in general. This aspect was what made Facebook the most fun.</div>

I was probably really annoying looking back on it. They used to post fun pictures of our days at school and just random things, and it was fun to scroll through and see what everyone was up to. Now nobody posts anymore and it's just boomer wasteland.</div>

I swear I don't understand how folks here can see this and still doubt that calm. I just wish everyone would think a little bit more before posting. Frankly the doubters are starting to embarrass themselves.

I will 100% have the ability to create my own open world games on the scale and style of morrowind in 2 years.

A lot of the tools needed to make an open world game such as voice and graphic design already exist in various different AI programs.

And this is still in the will smith spaghetti phase.</div>

“Create a four panel web comic. In the first panel it’s a guy sitting on his bed at home. In the second panel it’s the guy sitting in his desk at work. In the second panel it’s the guy sitting on his couch at home in front of the tv. In the third panel it’s the guy sitting on his bed again, and he’s saying “damn this kinda sucks”. The way he’s sitting in all four panels should be exactly the same.”

Literally gets it exactly right.</div>

It's impressive, but in the second panel the monitor is facing the wrong way, the AI doesn't understand spatial orientation.

It seems like a minor detail but if you try to parse the image as an actual 3d scene it's disturbing.

Also - the expression staying the same in the last panel is wrong. Another subtle detail that is disturbing once you see it.

In time, image generators will reach “visual perfection” far faster than LLMs will reach AGI. But whomever gets to AGI first will be the winner takes all.

I feel like we are at the point in Gen AI where investors are starting to expect results. Image generation gives companies time to develop agents that can actually replace office workers while also siphoning art commission money. I feel like the consumer applications are less frosting, and more of a proof of concept for investors and for gathering data (also money).</div>

In Gemini 2.5, I uploaded my entire code project, the 3 research papers from arxiv it is based on, and Gemini immediately said, "Make a backup of your project. We're stripping it down, piece by piece, to find the root cause. I already have a couple ideas what it might be. Your implementation of this language model architecture differs from what is shown in the paper- let's align your architecture with the paper, then move on from there."

We then spent all day taking each piece out of my language model, like an ablation study, seeing if it resolved the issue. Running diagnostics on checkpoints using programs written by Gemini.

Hours later: https://i.imgur.com/Q6m0zFS.png

Claude *never* would have been able to dig deep enough to find that. Never.</div>

It’s the lack of curiosity, lack of diverse guests and pushing of an agenda that has soured JRE for me. We don’t get Neil Degrasse Tyson or Paul Stamets episodes anymore. I don’t need to hear how the woke left is so bad in every single episode. If I wanted right wing propaganda I’d go to the Daily Wire.</div>

I just don’t like that I can fairly accurately predict that every episode there will be some rant about Covid, the left, Canada, how Musk is the smartest guy in the world, etc.

I want variety back on the show. At this point we’re basically only getting fellow comedians who need the Rogan bump to continue making money or people who tend to lean right and want to talk about how fucked the left is.</div>

They seem to believe everything that Trump says even when he says contradictory things. They think the 2020 election was stolen. therefore, stealing elections is okay. They believe the 'russia russia russia hoax' was an actual hoax with nothing substantive about it. Therefore, lying about everything is okay. They think that George soros was making important decisions in government. Therefore, Elon can too.

If you point out the obvious corruption happening in real time, Eric Adams, this law firm, etc. They'll say, "The government has always been corrupt."

I was very vocally against it because it seemed suspicious where the money was going, who was in charge, and I was essentially isolated for those few weeks, or whatever it wasn, because I was as an "asshole", "not caring", all because I was using my brain to think before acting. 

The "I told you so" feeling when that dude got caught naked and jerking it was an all-time feeling.</div>

I've spoken to Ross Coulthart on multiple occasions and I know he's a man of integrity that protects sources and sits on very definitive Intel. I'm believing we'll see uncovered criminal activity over these next few years. 

As for what judgments would get dished out for those disclosures - that's to be seen.

All the best to you, Ross.

                        <div class="comment-body">Didn’t this guy say something catastrophic would happen in the beginning of 2025? That 2024 would be the calm before the storm?  The same guy that interviewed a “whistleblower” that claimed he lost a ton of skin after being close to a UAP, but has not one photo of said injury? The same whistleblower that claims people call UFOs out of the sky with their brain, but has zero proof or video of it? The same guy that is charging billionaires to go see the supposed ability of channeling UFOs into sight. Yeah I’m sure this part is true though. Sick and tired of bumping their gums together with zero proof. We are passed the phase of being intrigued about someone touting crazy stuff. Proof.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Totally. And something is very fishy here. Ross said he has photographic evidence of a UAP that he took while he was part of the recent group meditation, and he said he will share it with us at some future point. Why wait? 

He also says that he now has some sort of contact with the phenomena and that his daughter has it even more often/or stronger than he does. But he hasn't talked much about that at all. Very bizarre. He seems like a great guy. I want to believe him. But he's been doing this for so many years now, and still we have almost nothing at all. Pfft. So tiring anymore.</div>

“..and frankly I’m happy! There are a multi-million audience responding”. 

They have a larger captivates and fervent audience to shill too. 

This isn’t to say all of them. But the ones like Elizondo to me are way too dodgy for me to listen earnestly to anymore.</div>

I notice lots of people feel this way. But what do you define as nothing? What is involved in your day?

Yesterday my day off went like this:

8am woke up had cereal, scrolled social media, emails etc

10am fell back asleep

2pm woke up. Felt guilty. Had lunch. Done some things I needed to do online- bills, cancel subscriptions etc. 

4pm listen to audio book whilst scrolling in bed

6pm dinner and tv

8pm shower. Tv. Scrolling. 

10pm ...</div>

8am wake up, scroll

9am fall asleep again

10am wake up, scroll

11am get up, have coffee/food

12-6pm listen to podcasts, snack, and do crosswords or colour in on the couch, if I'm burnt out I'll just watch reels or do those things in bed

6pm water the garden 

7-8pm make/have dinner

9pm podcast and crossword or scrolling in bed until I fall asleep

Do I feel guilty? Yes. But fuck that noise, we're not supposed to be productive all the time. We're mammals not machines.</div>

On your off day, you did do important things during lunch. So to me that sounds like a good day. 


You had lots of scrolling through. Have you thought about swapping out some of the time you scroll with something else? 


Eg I like reading because I find it relaxing. So maybe replace scrolling with something you find restful and relaxing (not something that you think should be productive though). </div>
