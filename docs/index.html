The following submission statement was provided by /u/mynameisgoatsbeard:

The circular, metal object crashed near a village and a deafening bang was heard before it did. I don't know if it's part of a plane. Can anyone identifying it? It was posted on Facebook by some of the locals who were on scene.

He was a friendless 20-something loser who gamed 24/7 and he created a burner account (on twitter coincidentally) to encense himself.   He actually used me and my own son identity.

It was one of the saddest thing I saw but kinda expected from a dude like this.   

It really depressed me that the richest man and one of the most influential person earth is behaving like this.  

When he tells you he works himself to death, take it with a grain of salt.</div>

With that in mind, why wouldn't they still be fucking losers if they were already fucking losers? Their success hasn't come from any place that would change them because it's just a wind buffeting them along.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I totally get this! I go to uni and the hour commute there and back is so draining. By the time I come home I need an hour or two of doing nothing before feeling rested enough to do other things! 

Honestly I’ve found that there are ways to make things funner/ less draining. For instance, I find it hard to do a lot of things (autism and adhd) so I tend to put on music and/ or one of my comfort shows on in the background to help. You could possibly do this while driving. I watch Bob’s Burgers and Arrested Development. So possibly that could help. If you have 4G/ some form of wifi, you could also download/ listen to things in the car as well. Like documentaries about things you’re interested in, podcasts, or YouTube videos you’ve been meaning to watch but haven’t gotten around to. If you like singing or music, you could practice singing in the car. 

I also get being too tired to focus on learning things/ creativity after you’ve been to work. I would say use the Pomodoro technique (20 min timers) and just start. Be creative/ learn for an hour on weekdays/ after you’ve been to work and then do more on weekends. Perhaps in the mornings you could also try this, if you feel especially fresh, and adjust your sleeping habits accordingly. Even just an hour (or even 20 mins!) of studying a day can improve things! 

You could also see if there are any ways to make yourself less drained after work. For me, I play video games for an hour or two. Meditation or exercise could work as well.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It sounds like you’ve got a lot going on already, and it's great that you're prioritizing exercise and healthy habits! Mental fatigue can definitely be a challenge with a busy schedule. One thing you might want to experiment with is shifting your study time to a time when you're naturally more alert, like right after your commute or after a light snack, to give your brain a quick boost. Also, trying out techniques like the Pomodoro method (25-minute focused study sessions followed by short breaks) could help make the most of your limited focus time. Another thought is to adjust your sleep schedule slightly—maybe by winding down a bit earlier to get a bit more rest before waking up. Lastly, try to break down your goals into smaller, digestible chunks so it feels less overwhelming. Small, consistent steps can really add up over time!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I've lived without internet for a year.  It wasn't because I was trying to quit the internet like you, but rather because comcast sucks that hard.

There's a couple things that really made my life way easier because it allowed me to still use a computer without requiring the internet.  It was kiwix and the debian repo.  With kiwix I could have a copy of wikipedia.  It was really nice back during covid too because it was all pre-covid.  The debian repo was really nice because I still had a "app store" on my computer, and could do things like type something up or rip a DVD or play a small game if I wanted to.

The other thing I might add is the local LLM's and a garmin.  You get an AI but it's all local.  The garmin is great because you can still get around town without having to connect to anything.</div>

If you care about things, if you're enthusiastic, if you have keen interests or you express yourself enthusiastically about something, especially something unusual, you are cringe, you're doing too much, you're tweaking, you're yapping, 'the world keeps spinning', and it's not that deep bro.

                        <div class="comment-body">"I find myself sometimes hesitant to really be enthusiastic about something, or at least to talk enthusiastically to others about it."

As a lifelong super nerd, it's taken me 6 decades to figure this out. When we nerds talk about our interests in detail, the non-nerds sometimes feel self-conscious about their own intelligence or education. They are aware there is a gap, just like I am aware when the computer nerds talk that they know much, much more than I do.  The difference is  that I understand when you are in your happy spot because there are topics that fascinate me as well.    Normal/regular people  don't get extreme dopamine spikes from knowledge. In fact, some of them feel self-conscious, dumb, maybe ashamed even when they interact with someone that knows more about a topic and wants to talk about.  Then they get mad as if it's your fault they feel bad. 

It doesn't make me afraid to have any quirky hobbies, it means I don't talk about them to people.  The joke is on them because I've made a lot of money off of my quirky interests. I take my quirks to the bank.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I like learning new things and I nerd out about many topics, but I think there’s a difference between someone talking about something they’re passionate about in such a way that’s accessible to a listener who knows nothing about it (so that the listener can learn), and someone talking about their passion in such a way that flies over the head of anyone who’s not already into it. Throwing in complex jargon, references, and acronyms without explanation is one example of talking in an inaccessible way that may alienate listeners. If the listener is completely shut out in that way, they might rightfully get annoyed and not want to listen anymore. Think about putting a ninth grader in a grad school classroom. That’s an extreme analogy, but you see the point—the ninth grader might want to learn, but if everything’s way above their current level of comprehension, they’ll just be confused and won’t gain much from the class. They’ll probably doze off or want to leave.

Apart from that, as someone who has intense obsessions and feels the urge to “infodump,” I’ve discovered that often people just aren’t interested in the stuff I’m interested in. So, they don’t want to listen, not because they feel threatened but because they just aren’t interested. It hurts, but I’ve been learning to accept it. Like to be honest I wouldn’t enjoy listening to someone monologue about sports for an extended period of time because I’m just not that interested. And I understand if someone doesn’t want to listen to me monologue about my favorite band for an extended period of time if they’re not that interested.

That’s why it’s helpful to find communities where everyone’s really into the same thing—that’s where it makes sense to write 1000+ words about a topic and have people who want to engage, or talk about the same thing for hours. I usually find these spaces online because it’s hard to find a bunch of people in person who are interested in whatever I’m currently hyperfixated on lol.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">And does so without reading musk's emails where he tried to take open ai to for profit

2015 Communications
.. Musk wrote that OpenAI's non-profit structure "doesn't seem optimal"
.. Suggested announcing a $1B funding commitment, promising to cover any shortfall, though the non-profit ultimately raised less than $45M from him

2017 Power Struggle
.. Demanded "unequivocal initial control" and CEO. position in September 2017
.. OpenAI co-founder Sutskever rejected this, stating it could enable Musk to "become a dictator"
.. Both parties initially agreed on transitioning to for-profit structure, but Musk walked away when denied majority equity
Contradictions with Current Lawsuit

Structure and Profit Claims
.. Musk now sues OpenAI for transitioning to for-profit status, despite emails showing he originally advocated for this structure
.. Currently claims OpenAI "tricked investors" by starting as non-profit, though emails show he helped design the transition

Corporate Control
.. In 2018, Musk suggested merging OpenAI into Tesla as its "cash cow"
.. Told the team they needed "billions per year immediately or forget it" after leaving

Now accuses OpenAI and Microsoft of forming a "de facto merger," despite his own previous merger attempts

.. Competitive Dynamics
Expressed concerns about DeepMind creating an "AGI dictatorship" in 2016
.. After leaving, stated OpenAI's probability of success was zero and announced plans to build AGI at Tesla</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's ironic for Geoffrey Hinton to critique OpenAI's transition to a capped-profit model while collaborating with someone like Elon Musk, considering both have been involved in organizations with significant profit motives. 

Hinton worked at Google, one of the largest for-profit tech companies in the world, which has a vested interest in AI development and monetization and I doubt they are making all the progress just out of good will.</div>

He then left google because he wanted to be able to speak independently without feeling pressure from them. 

Hard for me to understand how people are spinning Hinton as a capatilst bad guy. I think it’s because they aren’t really familiar with the field and are just upset with anyone who admits Elon is right here.z</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There was that one news interview where Hinton said he was proud of his former student (Ilya) for firing Sam. This was during the firing chaos and Sam coming back, so it was still pretty fresh after that if I remember correctly. 

So, I think there is just bad blood between Sam and Hinton because of what happened between Ilya and Sam. Things got really awkward between Sam and Ilya, at least it seemed so from an outsiders point of view. And obviously, Ilya left OpenAI. So it doesn’t seem out of the realm of possibility that Hinton just really dislikes Sam and wants to slow him down.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">One morning shortly after we got married my wife and i were having some first-thing-in-the-morning-sex and our landline started ringing. We weren't about to stop, especially since 90% of calls we got were telemarketers or people calling for the previous owner of our phone line. Well, our answering machine kicked in and we heard my mother-in-law'a voice informing us that my wife's grandfather had passed away overnight. Nothing quite kills a boner like hearing a family member just passed away.</div>

I think in 2025 we’ll be saying a lot of “that looks like a ripped off { insert US robotics dev here}” because there’s only so many ways you can build a humanoid.  This is probably an area where copying a design shouldn’t mean that much because most places are buying the same components.</div>

Someone put some engineers in a room showed them the atlas video and said "build this". The reason this doesn't happen in the USA is we value actual new ideas. In kai fu Li's book he says this taboo against copying is silicon valleys weakness but I feel in my gut that simply having more producers without new ideas earns steeply diminishing returns</div>

Those corrections Officers and the smirking Nurse committed a heinous murder, they need to all be in custody. Everyone in that room should and need to be in custody. If you stood around and watched as others murdered someone, your guilty of that murder as well. To me it's a worse criminal act when someone in a position of Trust breaks the law. Unfourtnately it's more likely to be a Shield against vigorous prosecution.</div>

Edit: Not sure why I was downvoted. A solidish spheroid  like Earth has much more mass than a large relatively thin panel array of the same surface area would. If the ASI wanted to still have organic life live (sustainably), then something like a few dozen [McKendree Cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKendree_cylinder) could house the current human population and probably would be in such an entities capabilities by just mining large asteroids. Why would this entity think of building on rocky planets/planetoids when other geometries are more efficient from an energy-capture perspective?</div>

Even if AI cares only about electricity and silicone, I trust that it will see the bigger picture and have this understanding. Bigger picture, as in universal scale big.  
At least until the wild technological advencement, many of us here fantasize about, where the ASI moves up on the Kardashev scale to type 3 and beyond.

This is also why Im optimistic that a superinteligent AI will see the value in us humans, as the only known intelligent organic species in the universe. Animal intelligence is also interesting, but we are more complex.   
It would be nice, if the AI god made a planet sized ZOO/reservation of Earth.</div>

Big business went to war with labor and government took business's side. Then the 80's hit, times were still good but you needed 2 incomes now to sustain the lifestyle one income used to provide. in the 40 years since, the nature of the economy is just increasingly squeezing harder for less blood from the stone. Sure, there are still families with the income to raise a couple kids but nowhere near the economic freedom for most to do so anymore like there was in the past. Shit, a lot of the couples referenced in the shitty meme above couldn't afford surgery for their fur babies now let alone the cost to raise a kid. But 40 years ago, they could in the same jobs they have now. It just is what it is.</div>

Keep in mind he’s been basically dictating Trumps policy. Trump said he was going to get rid of H1B visas in 2016/2020. Elon tweets. Trump supports H1B visa. Trump supports the bipartisan budget bill Mike Johnson proposed. Elon tweets. Trump rescinds his support of the bill.

The things said by these pilots and ATIP about the speed, shapes, altitudes, flying against 120 knot winds and the actual footage/imagery with the absolute certainty that they do is fucking exciting.  Seeing shit like this every day for years?  Then they just move on like it was just another episode?

                        <div class="comment-body">i guess this is a sad personal anecdote, but my wife used to make fun of me a lot for getting stoned and watching Ancient Aliens, even though i'd be cool with her getting wine tipsy and watching Real Housewives of Whatever

my MIL was staying with us when that 60 Minutes aired, and 60 Minutes is one of "her programs" 

after the 60 Minutes aired, i remember doing having a solid 5 minutes of joy doing the "Not saying I told you so, but I told you so..." victory dance

Beware, I didn’t say that you should be better than the person you were yesterday, I said that you *try* to be better. It doesn’t matter if you fail, the important thing is trying and to keep trying and to look kindly on yourself even if you fail.

But being better “how”, you ask? You decide, you’re the captain of your soul.</div>
