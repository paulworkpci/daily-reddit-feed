                                <div class="reply-body">dude i just tried this test. i don't believe for a second that human baseline is 83%.

they only had 9 people participate and they were all probably programmers themselves on the more intelligent side of things.

even with that, half the questions are left to interpretation and specifically designed to trick you or force you to make assumptions because it doesn't give you enough information to really go on.  like the last question talks about a glove falling out of the back of the car on a bridge over a river.  wind 1km/hr west, river flowing 5km/h east. where is the glove in an hour?   the answer is less than 1 km north of where the car dropped it because it would have been travelling 30km/h when it fell out the car and supposedly stay where it lay.   you have to assume the bridge is not wide enough for it to have blown on the 1km/hr breeze out into the river, or not slowly caught breezes over an hour and land in the water, and just assume it never moves once it hits the ground.   we dont know the glove material, how heavy it is, whether or not it would be able to move in a 1km/hr breeze, a bunch of stuff that can influence whether or not it could end up in the water.

so i think there are actually multiple answers that one could assume but it makes only one answer right without giving you enough information to actually make that a 'right' answer.    it may be the most 'probable' answer, but thats about it.   i got 5 out of 10 right even understanding what these questions were trying to do.

some of them are literally ridiculous like the one where three people are doing a 200 meter race and you're left to try to assume who finishes last, some dude that counts from -10 to 10 but skips one number, some dude that sidetracks to rush up the top of his residental tower and stare at the view for a few seconds (with no indication of how far away his tower is or how many floors high it is to get an estimate of how long that might take), or some dude that is old af and reads a longass tweet (unknown length), waves to some people, and walks over the finish line (assuming he walked the whole way, no way to know).

its no wonder these LLMs are struggling.  the 83% is complete bullshit.  i would be surprised if the average human population would even score 50% on these.</div>

"Modern language models are powerful, but typically static after deployment. A major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we investigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after full finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields only an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual learning in large language models."</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Seems like a big deal. Im no ML scientist but I do think that subdividing models into specialized cores that can be updated independently is a necessary step to reach AGI. It allows for better organization and I think generalization as each component offers elements that are re-combined through the interactions across the cores. It also limits irrelevant knowledge from tainting the process. Lots of interesting potential dynamics at work here from a cognitive structure standpoint.

Having a model that personalizes itself to you with memory that is deeply woven into the parameters and neural structures/layers could overcome the need to feed a model context over and over, and from having old context corrupting new information. Layering some Bayesian surprise mechanism into this and some of the cool evolutionary algorithm ideas could produce something really special and adaptive. 

Imagine a model ecosystem where each scientist has a unique model that captures some elements of their own cognitive process and intuition. These models could then collaborate virtually to bounce ideas back and forth with other scientists across specialities. The peer-review of an ecosystem of divergent models would be more powerful than some single fine tuned "grader" fork of GPT 5 or Gemini 2.5.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">While the intuition for sparse learning could be good, with such new models we always need to be reserved. Let's see if in 6 months many other LLM developers follow suit. We have thousands of papers like this one that seem promising at first, but lead nowhere. Not saying this idea is not good, just that real value will be revealed in time.

Continual learning is considered one of the fundamental problems still left to be solved towards more general AI. You need learning to continue, not be frozen in time, because your models can't acquire new capabilities after training by in-context-learning, they can only recombine or reuse older skills they learned. For truly new skills we still need training.</div>

I wanted to believe somehow Trump would do some good his second time around. My fucking god. ANYONE who still supports himself is either a sycophant, a traitor, or a fool. Possibly all three. 

I did not know the levels of damage a single man could do to the proposed "greatest nation to ever exist." He has destroyed and defiled more than I thought would EVER be possible... in less than a year. 

If you find yourself reading this and thinking I am wrong, you might want to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. His dick is in your ass too, you just haven't realized it yet. 

And to think... a cleft lipped, strange little cretin child nearly saved the goddamn United States of America. If we only knew then what we know know - that poor kid may have been the most patriotic time traveler to have ever lived. 

Fuck Donald Trump, his cabinet, fuck the entirety of the Legislative branch, and the majority of the Judicial branch (the rest will fall in line soon, I am sure), and fuck you if you disagree with anything I have said - you are legitimately a traitor and have been swindled just like those children your hero liked to fuck so much (and still would if his dick still worked)</div>

Unironically all working mostly fine in California.

Except we have even better healthcare if you have zero dollars.

                <div class="post-content">I came across this fascinating method called **Inner Smile Meditation**, based on ancient Taoist energy healing.

It’s all about gently smiling *inwardly* to each organ  heart, lungs, liver, kidneys  and releasing stored emotions through awareness and gratitude.

I tried it for a few days and noticed subtle emotional changes  calmer breathing, lighter mood, even less tension in my chest.

Has anyone else practiced this technique or noticed similar effects? How many month did you try?

A decent amount of israelis were against the war, so it possibly might be about the ceasefire more than the hostages, no?

Some people online love the idea because AI could do all the boring stuff while humans focus on **hobbies or creativity**.  
Others say we will lose purpose identity and motivation if jobs vanish.  

If this really happened what do you think life would look like?  
Would you still choose to work or just live off what AI provides?</div>

did the math real quick. if we use copilot/cursor the normal way, building these one by one, we're looking at a month minimum. told the boss this, he just said "figure it out" and walked away lol

spent that whole day just staring at the requirements. user auth service, payment processing, notifications, analytics, admin api. all pretty standard stuff but ...</div>

Auto generated API contracts and less relying on test output and more on real one (you can have AI do this, does not mean test yourself) catches a lot of what you wrote. 

But glad it worked out! Sound like you’ve learned a ton as well. To bad about the horrible boss…</div>

Doc files here, agent files there, external reviews from other agents and I don’t know what. 

Almost everything can be caught with a decent CI/CD pipeline for PRs. You can have AI write it, set up a self-hosted runner on GitHub. And never let anything that fails in it go into your main branch. 

Set up a preflight script that runs the same tests and checks. That’s about the only rule you’ll need.

You don't have to do CI/CD and PR if you are working solo though. That's overkill.

CC already has native hook feature. Otherwise just leave it to the [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/).

My personal favorite that require no setup is just using your brain. Learn how to programming.</div>

It is very helpful for sure, and it gets better every few months with new model releases, but it can still be very unreliable due to the inherently nondeterministic nature of the LLMs.

Instead, my suggestion would be to invest more time in all sorts of linters, e.g., ESLint, RuboCop, etc. AI makes writing custom rules / adopting existing plugins much easier, and you get both a deterministic outcome and a feedback loop for coding agents that are forced to fix all linting errors before finishing.

Obviously, not all coding rules can be easily quantified into a linting rule, but in my experience, most of them are.</div>

Then again... it wouldn't make sense to give it the label in the first place. It's an AI, and because it can't actively believe or disbelieve, it's simply not an applicable term.

Honestly, I could go either way on this one.</div>

"Abstract

We propose an extension of the decoder Transformer that conditions its generative process on random latent variables which are learned without supervision thanks to a variational procedure. Experimental evaluations show that allowing such a conditioning translates into substantial improvements on downstream tasks."


" Conclusion

The Free Transformer is a direct extension of a standard decoder Transformer, with the abstract structure of a conditional VAE. It is implemented with a single additional non-causal Transformer block and requires a few percent of computational and memory usage overhead.


Its structure makes it able to learn latent random variables unsupervised, and to condition its generative process on them. In some ways, this approach aims at achieving in latent space with an autoencoder what reasoning models do with chains-of-thought in token space and an RL procedure (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). A combination of the two is, of course, promising.


The performance boost without tuning the optimization hyperparameters across multiple benchmarks and two sizes of models, is a strong signal that the overall approach actually improves the inductive bias of the vanilla Transformer.


Many properties and design choices should be explored. The performance curves during training are often unstable, possibly due to the coupling of the optimization of the encoder and the decoder, and using different optimization methods could be fruitful. The random embedding itself could take many forms, and the one used in our implementation is arbitrary.


Finally, the behavior in larger scales, both in parameter count and dataset size, remains to be investigated"</div>

A breakthrough in the humanoid robot's movement. From humanoid form to crawler mode. Imagine the G1 in a complex rescue environment, unable to leap over obstacles and forced to crawl on the ground. This is a potential application.
