Now, the question is, who outside of Bernie Sanders or AOC or John Stewart or whatever will speak out against dear leader first and discover what real cancel culture looks like? Imho a powerful message has already been sent.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Lol he’s just making shit up. I live in Canada. Literally none of that is an issue. None of this shit is true. Trudeau stepped down because he fucked the economy and ramped up immigration to a level that pissed Canadians off. We spoke out and he resigned. Tell me how that aligns with Rogan saying we cannot speak up and are communist? Our leader quit because we wanted him to. Good luck getting Trump to ever step down. LOL. 

We can express ourselves just fucking fine. Here I’ll show you: Fuck Trudeau, and fuck Trump. There. What’s gonna happen?

Like is he really that fucking dumb? I think it’s just more right wing propaganda to shit on Canada because that’s what daddy Trump wants. 

We have just as much freedom as Americans, and more in many aspects. Americans just don’t know anything about Canada, it’s pathetic. Go back to school Rogan, holy shit.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The inevitable corporate takeover of the internet has happened. When Iw as a kid in the 90s the adults told me to be sure to enjoy the internet before the corporations ruined it, and we are definitely at that point. Like cable people will naturally find something more entertaining.

It was easier to actually connect with real people on the internet in the early 2000s, which is what made it pretty addicting but now everything is so manufactured that it is just a slightly more stimulating version of TV. The average person will likely stick with the internet for a while, but the people who like to seek novelty, the trendsetters are already migrating away from it because there is nothing left for them here.

I think the young tech trendsetters are goign to naturally gravitate towards real world things like hacker/makerspaces. Face to face interaction ironically is the novel thing for nerds to do now. For non nerds (hipsters) they will jsut flock to other traditional third spaces like bookstores and coffee shops.</div>

I switch between Omnifocus and Skedpal and I find whenever I switch I tweak my setup and it feels clear and highly effective. Fast forward a few months and the work as a business owner and dad of 3 boys plus spouse and two dogs the to do list piles up.

It’s not enough to reach some milestone first and be ahead, you have to stay ahead for all the years to come and you do that by building. A superintelligence that can cure individual diseases with three weeks of thinking time is not in the same league as one which can coordinate a worldwide network of robots and factories to construct a space elevator or a vertical food farm in every city. The datacenters today might be enough to train an AGI model but not to export and sell that intelligence at high bandwidth to the rest of the world and outcompete China in the global intelligence market. Decisions which shape the post-AGI or post-ASI world have to be made now by our dumb brains because infrastructure takes a long time to build.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/PyroIsSpai:

Two additional not yet posted "egg" images from the claimed 4chan leaker, including one that shows the surface texture with what look like symbols upon it. I don't have the original 4chan URL for these. They are starting to propogate across the various UFO-related subreddits; I found them on one of those.

Do those symbols look familiar to anyone?

Q: Any symbols on craft or anything?


A. No symbols on the “egg”, nothing. Inside we did find some things we symbols, but this is as far as I can go. Sorry.


So either that specific answer was a troll masquerading as OP, or these pictures aren't legit, or there's multiple eggs some with symbols some without, or any number of lies for whatever reason. </div>

The only reason they would be shuffling this amount of money towards one project is if they were incredibly confident in the science behind it.

Sam Altman selling snake oil and using tweets solely to market seems pretty much debunked as of today, these are people who know what’s going on inside OpenAI and others beyond even o3, and they’re willing to invest more...</div>

Like, last week, I was sayin’ ‘it’s over,’ now I’m sayin’ ‘we’re back,’ and you’re sittin’ there all smug askin’, ‘What changed?’ What changed? Everything changed! $500 billion, that’s what freakin’ changed. You know how much that is, Doc? More than most countries! That’s real power—real vision. People don’t throw that kinda cash around for some pipe dream.”

“And what, you think I’m supposed to just sit here like some mook and not get excited about that? Like I’m flippin’ sides or somethin’? Look, maybe last week I didn’t see the bigger picture, alright? But you got Sam Altman or whoever the hell pulling strings like that? That ain’t snake oil; that’s serious. It’s like—what’s the word—singularity? Yeah, singularity. This whole vibe shift, it’s real, Doc. You wouldn’t understand—it’s business, it’s respect, it’s momentum. You don’t hesitate when you see somethin’ big like this, you adjust.”

“So don’t sit there, all judgy, tryin’ to psychoanalyze me over a freakin’ vibe shift. Maybe the world’s changing, alright? Maybe it’s time we start changin’ too. And if I wanna say ‘we’re back’ this week, that’s my freakin’ prerogative.”</div>

&gt; Egg shaped UAP and “Pod” in Antartica photos

It’s me again. As I promised, a few hours ago, here are some of the photos of the Antarctica retrieval mission, in Queen Elizabeth’s Range.

- Photo 1- Egg UAP.       
- Photo 2- Egg UAP (another angle).       
- Photo 3-“Hieroglyphs” on the cave’s wall.       
- Photo 4-“Pod” where the entity was sleeping.      
- Photo 5-“Pod” where the entity was sleeping (another angle)

Sorry for the delay.

Nobody is giving out money. The US government isn't giving out anything except vibes here - this an announcement which for some reason\* was made by the President of the US about three private companies (one of which isn't even publicly traded) committing to spend $100B building datacentres for OpenAI and hoping to pick up some partners for the other $400B. 

There is no evidence that the three companies have access to $100B to invest in this right now.

\* = In order to do what it has done, and muddy the waters between what is private and what is being done by the US gov.</div>

There are a ton of NSFW subs that are posting stuff like this, i find that super odd. Why, no one is going to those subs to be political, it's weird as fuck to make those into a political battle ground where people are jerking off... I would imagine it would be like going to a strip club and them telling you their opinions of elon musk and how you should think of him. That's weird, and to be honest not the people whom i want deciding what is and isn't moral to view.</div>

I wonder if Sam gave Trump access to their internal SOTA model (o3 Pro+?) to assist with the 200 executive orders he made recently.

                        <div class="comment-body">This is Dario’s specific definition of “powerful AI” taken from [the essay he mentions](https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace) in this interview:

* Superhuman Intelligence: It is smarter than a Nobel Prize winner across most relevant fields like biology, programming, math, engineering, and writing. This implies it can solve complex problems in these fields, prove unsolved theorems, create novels, and write difficult code.

* Human-like Interfaces: It has access to typical human interfaces like text, audio, video, mouse, keyboard, and internet access, allowing interaction with digital systems and remote operations.

* Autonomous Task Completion: It can be given tasks that take hours, days, or weeks and can complete them autonomously, requesting clarification when needed, like a smart employee.

* Control of Physical Tools: Although it doesn’t have a physical embodiment, it can control physical tools, robots, and lab equipment through computers and can even design its own tools.

* Multiple Copies: The trained model can be replicated millions of times, matching projected cluster sizes, and each copy can act independently or collaboratively.

* Faster than Human Speed: The model can absorb information and generate actions at roughly 10x-100x the speed of humans.

Also wanted to add the specific quote about the cluster size thing:

&gt; The resources used to train the model can be repurposed to run millions of instances of it (this matches projected cluster sizes by ~2027), and the model can absorb information and generate actions at roughly 10x-100x human speed.

Dario Amodei is essentially saying *millions* of ASI instances could very well be running in massive data centers by 2027</div>

I really like his writing style honestly it's a big breather from most CEO publications. He's always been way more frank with his opinions and it shows here.</div>

horrible take. 

there is still time for you to delete this.

how is it conceivably possible that you did not factor the possibility that Sam and co. is constantly in meetings with researchers/engineers where they give progress and forecast updates, and he is only relaying their opinions.

how could you have such a lapse in reasoning?

is your need to suck Dario dick so great that you feel the need to shit on others?

1 datapoint is an opinion, 2 data points is an observation, 3 or more is almost certainty.

if all the big labs are saying the same thing why would you conclude that 1 guy knows what he's talking about and the others don't WHEN THEY'RE ALL SAYING 1+1 = 2? 🤦‍♀️</div>

                <div class="post-content">I \[23M\] am a senior in college, and my school has an unusually long winter break, about six weeks. It’s way longer than most schools, and while I love the downtime, I’ve started to notice a weird pattern. Every year, right after New Year’s, I get this rare chance to fully relax for about 3.5 weeks, right when New years ends. No exams, no projects, no obligations, just time to chill.

During this stretch, my days are pretty simple. I spend my mornings just hanging out, maybe scrolling or watchi...</div>

I also had many years a mild winter depression sleeping way longer, not doing much.

Another thing is CO2, in the winter people don't air out enough. If the CO2 ppm is like 2000+ in the room you will feel sluggish and tired.

In the winter the outside air is often worse than in the summer so you need to air out even more. If you stay in a room alone at least every 3 hours for 5min.  
That made a big difference for me to concentrate in the evening more. I aired out way too little when it was cold.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Diet is relatively healthy. My only bad habit is I snack a lot after the gym, but that's it.

I tried going to the gym early a few years ago and absolutely hated it. I have noticed that when I take a walk, usually at like 10-11am, I feel a bit better those days. Problem is just we've had awful weather the past 3 weeks. The walks don't even feel good because its just windy and blowing snow in my face the whole time.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">My guess is that maybe you're getting too much sleep. Paradoxically, if you sleep too much you will also feel tired. It could be seasonal affective disorder which would definitely make you feel more tired. If you think about it, humans have adapted to conserve energy during the darker times of the year (winter) since hunting is more difficult so you'll sleep more, you can trick your body into thinking its summer using light. As someone else mentioned light is a powerful way to influence circadian rhythm. If you sit in front of a  SAD lamp first thing in the morning for 30 minutes at about 1 foot you will have more energy throughout the day. You also want to dim lights drastically an hour before bed. Going to sleep and waking up at the exact same time everyday regardless of what you have to do that day is the best thing you can do for sleep quality. 

Also, if you spend mornings just scrolling that will make you more tired and if you're doing it in your bed its even worse since your brain will associate the bed with not sleeping, but rather scrolling. Sometimes going for walks periodically will keep you energized. Eating smaller meals with low GI foods will help you stay awake as they won't cause blood sugar spikes which make you tired. The biggest thing that helped me with energy is completely cutting out added sugar, so only getting sugar from sources like fruit as they digest more slowly. After a few days I was shocked by the amount of energy I had.

  
Personally I find I also need structure in my life and that helps me feel much better. Just seeing people, having something that needs to be done, and places I need to be helps me feel more productive and that motivates me to do other things as well that feel productive. During breaks I feel like my mental health goes downhill fast and it's because I'm not taking care of myself as well as I should and I'm also isolating a lot more. I'm sure being in front of a screen often is fatiguing as well. I'm typically relieved when I get to return to classes which is funny. One of the best things I did was sign up for a community art class, they are super cheap and they give you some structure as well as some homework which would be drawing things. You also get to socialize and learn a new fun skill.</div>

Is it strategic from gvt/tech/media because they're so reliant on us being on our phones? Or is it our own self-avoidance/acceptance that we actually, as a society, have an extremely unhealthy relationship with our phones. 

An addiction is something you can't stop doing that gets in the way of your life. That *is* how people use their phones today. 

Is there something else I'm missing? Will the addiction ever be recogni...</div>

Same thing happened with weed for decades. Only recently are people generally accepting abusive weed usage as an addiction.


Chemical addictions and mental addictions are both addictions. </div>

The trouble it seems with phones is it's a double edge sword

1- Users don't want to face the music 

2-Outsiders don't acknowledge that the addiction is real</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's not officially considered an addiction due to how we define addiction in the DSM. It's not really a conspiracy. It's just that things like the internet and phone addiction are not the same as drug addictions. They lack an exogenous substance that is directly altering brain chemistry to produce dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal.

When someone loses access to their phone or internet, they generally feel better within a few seconds or hours. Sometimes a day or two. Anything longer is usually due to underlying issues they were masking but could be struggling to get themselves into a new routine without their phones. I think we just need a different categorization for it in the DSM. Likely, it'll be similar to gambling addiction once it is better characterized and definable.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Feeling better in seconds or hours is not what I see from the people I'm interacting with. Nor a day. It usually takes weeks to shake the impulse and even then, you still have to work out how you can interact with phones since most people cannot function in society without it.

I understand it's not categorized in DSM (neither is porn addiction, but it is recognized). I also understand there's nuance when compared to substance addiction. I don't want to belittle anyone who is dealing with something at that level. 

The biggest issue, I think, is we don't acknowledge that the average time spent on phones (5 hours a day!) is in part to compulsion. 

I see in your other comment that 10-12 hours a day is problematic, but would you say 5 is acceptable? 

I don't think society will accept that it's addictive impulses that bring us back to doom scrolling or other unhealthy phone practices.</div>
