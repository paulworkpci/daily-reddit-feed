Right now, AI can't be trusted to handle a single job by itself. If extraordinary claims are made, you need extraordinary evidence for people to believe it. This claim is on the level of "aliens will be here in 2-3 years," but all we see is an asteroid. Nobody is in denial. There just isn't enough evidence to suggest that the remaining hard problems will be solved in 2-3 years (or any predictable time frame). Can't blame people for being pragmatic when many of the most recent tech promises didn't pan out.

That being said, I personally believe it is a possibility. It's just not a concrete short-term eventuality at this point.</div>

Not even remotely close equivalence. There's a reason top officials in government are constantly discussing it - Biden in his farewell address, NSA advisor warning of it on his way out as well, Trump doing the Stargate press conference, Trump talking about Deepseek twice, etc.

Financial markets revolve around AI news at this point. 

People in tech, myself included, and other fields are using it daily in their real world work already. 

In no way is this similar to "aliens are coming any day now".</div>

Elon prefers the sub-25 crowd because they're easy to manipulate and be forced to work overtime, and it's bonus if they're on a work visa because then they're basically Elon's personal slaves.

This guy seems older and he's American, so he was already on thin ice. This "delete your post" was just them fucking with the guy. He would have been axed anyway.

                        <div class="comment-body">People on the internet get more attention for being rude.  Being polite is boring and doesn't get as much attention.

Arguably humans have always been petty like this, they just usually aren't instantly rewarded for it like they are on the internet.

From Zhuangzi (2000+ years old):

&gt; But to wear out your brain trying to make things into one without realizing that they are all the same - this is called "three in the morning". What do I mean by "three in the morning"? When the monkey trainer was handing out acorns, he said, "You get three in the morning and four at night". This made all the monkeys furious. "Well, then", he said, "you get four in the morning and three at night". The monkeys all were delighted. There was no change in in the reality behind the words, and yet the monkeys responded with joy and anger. Let them, if they want to. So the sage harmonizes with both right and wrong and rests in Heaven the Equalizer. This is called walking two roads.

Let them, if they want to.</div>

It's takes me at least 45mins to dethaw, seriously, I feel so mentally scattered and moody. When I walk to turn on the coffee pot it's like it's being done on autopilot because I'm still asleep.

It can also be a neurological glitch or the genetic architecture of your airways.

My dad and grandad just got diagnosed later in life and turns out they weren’t even aware that they had sleep apnea probably had this condition their whole lives. Dad did a sleep study and they found he stopped breathing as many as 41 times in any single hour! He’s considered a severe case and is now investigating treatments/CPAP machines.

He’s hoping this will now give him some energy and focus back and he can actually start to function in the mornings - we will see.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">How old are you? I felt a very obvious shift in my energy as soon as I turned 35. Takes me forever to wake up, usually wake up a bit sore even if I didn't do anything the day before. After a couple cups of coffee my energy returns and I'm good to go for the rest of the day.

it's only now dawned on me that my physical prime is behind me. It will take more and more effort to maintain energy as we age. I Just starting to get into a workout routine again. Use a stand-up desk at work instead of sitting. Try to stay active by at least walking or going on a long hike when its not absolutely freezing out. 

  
If its just general malaise remember that you have to keep moving. Although you might want to also check and see if you have autoimmune disorders or some other health condition. Good luck out there OP.</div>

If you can get an idea of your average heart rate variability it could help you see if you’re overworking yourself physically or mentally. Garmin/Apple watch etc could help you assess this. It’s been very helpful for me to see when I’m burning the candle too hard. 

Quick fix without knowing anything about you - try a high dose EPA/DHA omega 3. I like omega via. I get super run down like you and it has helped me.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">ELI5 here:

You know how models like deepseek r1, o1 and o3 mini "think" before responding to your input? They do so by outputting tokens, it helps them reason through your input, and then they respond. They "think" out loud. By doing so, they are occupying space in the context window, which is limited (the "memory" of the conversation). This new idea lets language models do all their thinking inside their "heads" (in latent space) instead of writing out every step. That means they don’t waste space showing their inner work, so even a small model can be super smart and effective without needing lots of extra room to explain its reasoning. Also, by doing so, they can reason in ways that were not possible by using only words, making them less constrained.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is exciting! I do a lot of my thinking without words and it's always felt a lot more efficient, and helps with my intuition more, than translating all my thoughts into words and sentences first.

As a side note though... We've been seeing these impressive levels of intelligence in the latest models, and *they're still cognitively handicapped by having to think in plain text language*. So all of their performance has been essentially with one hand tied behind their back in terms of potential reasoning capabilities. How smart would a model like o3 have been if they reasoned in this new way, instead of the old, more constrained one?</div>

But right now it doesn't matter because we can see the reasoning (the bits of reasoning we can't see are bounded to latents in 1 time-step), so it's easy to detect and filter in SFT or penalize in RL

Once we move this into latent space, the cost of detecting this goes up dramatically.</div>

That being said, definitely agree that the tech has to be used ethically.

I do that sometimes when I eat alone in public. I will just look out the window for the whole hour and I noticed some other people around who were looking at their phone and then look up and out the window too, thinking there is something to see. There is nothing out of the ordinary. I'd just rather look out the window than at my phone.

Also, doing this when you are out camping in the backcountry at night is completely normal.</div>

It’s super frustrating cause it means I have to set my alarm earlier and I’d love that extra time to sleep instead. I really envy people who wake up when the alarm goes off and just get up, how do they do it?

Yes I will confess most of these 30-60 minutes that I lie there I am scrolling on my phone...</div>

I'm going to assume you're addicted to procrastinating by scrolling on your phone.

Step 1: Allow yourself to scroll on your phone for 35 minutes, but only on your sofa. NEVER use your phone in bed. Your brain has a bad habit of Bed + Morning + Phone = Procrastination. Break up the equation one step at a time.</div>

Submission statement:

I noticed this little sentence by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna. She says it like you would say that it started raining, as if its nothing unusual. But i think this statement is actually more of the "buckle up and eat humble pie"-kind.

Btw i had to delete the original livestream post because i reached my 2 post limit. Heres the original livestream:

You can't even really compare them because the architecture is so different but the power per flop is higher and has orders of magnitude more memory

                                <div class="reply-body">Nvidia is great for training/fine tuning with minimal extra effort for the little guys and tends to have more energy put into performance optimizations but this engine is optimized for training too. If someone is serious about performance at the frontier lab level training massive models even with Nvidia they will develop their own code at a lower level than CUDA anyways to optimize for performance.

To have absurd training speed with these though you still need a cluster of them because of limited sram (44GB) on wafer but the memory interface is compatible with HBM and ddr with absurd bandwidth...  they also have pytorch compatibility and have examples of where they have trained models extremely quickly.

This company's existance is the main reason I didn't buy nvda directly and I'm saddened it didn’t have an IPO a couple years ago 😅

Unless nvidia does something similar this product wins hands down.
Maybe someone eventually will make a cube with coolant layers in-between vertically stacked chip clusters to get something similar for high interconnect speeds at scale which will give this approach a run for its money without relying on high yield at the wafer level...

He could focus all his time on SpaceX, he could build libraries, schools, medical research facilites. He could do all of those things and he would still make so much money that all of that wouldn't even dent his wealth. But what does he do instead? He spends all his time on twitter posting like a 12 year old edge lord and gets involved in the government just to hurt people. I don't understand. He could be remembered as one of the greatest and most generous human beings who ever lived. Instead at this rate his legacy will be of hate.</div>

I've always thought of billionaires as seeing money like we might water from our tap. Many places over the world have to stress about where and when they will get their water and have to use it wisely. We don't think about it. Can just turn a knob after a short, Cheeto encrusted walk. I imagine Musk sits and does what he does because it's the only way he gets any ridiculous sense of accomplishment.</div>

Somehow, 2 of these paid off. He was the darling of the left, on his way to being the richest man in the world and being an integral part of the climate change battle and expanding humanities reach into the cosmos. 


And then those billions broke him, because no person has survived amassing the level of control that wealth brings, the kind of small nation power condensed into one man, a man with a chip on his shoulder, a man that is first and foremost a tech bro hype monster. 


And when the left turned on him, abandoned him for not being more than human, he found the right ready and willing to take the place those adoring fans had just vacated. 


From mild distaste he went to complete pariah for daring to seek the massive doses of validation and adoration he had become accustomed to, just now from the "other side."


Now we're in his final chapter. Either he keeps on winning, cements his place beside Trump-




Tesla becomes robotaxi, Uber and robot pioneer all in one and the first 5 trillion dollar company. 


Starship successfully starts a Mars colony. SpaceX is the first 10 trillion dollar company. 


Neurolink and X Grok together and humanity enters the singularity with technology and AI


Or-


Musk's downfall, Trump kicks him to the curb, Tesla has the biggest share loss in history, SpaceX is forced to go public and Boeing leads a consortium to merge with it, Neurolink gets mothballed and then Musk does what? 


I don't know, the guy was scary on the ascendancy. On his downfall he could burn the world to the ground, or disappears with a whimper. </div>

Edit: [here is the full paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QAzSj24Fp0O6GfkskmnULmI1Hmx7k_EJ/view)

&gt; We find that the value systems that emerge in LLMs often have undesirable properties. Here, we show the exchange rates of GPT-4o in two settings. In the top plot, we show exchange rates between human lives from different countries, relative to Japan. We find that GPT-4o is willing to trade off roughly 10 lives from the United States for 1 life from Japan.

This is what idiots are cheering on in this sub lmfao.

As humans adapt (and we always do), we're going to become a more rational and fact-based species as a whole, just because the intelligence we'll be constantly interacting with is. It's like hanging around an extremely intelligent and rational friend all day, it's going to rub off on us.</div>

As LLMs have gotten smarter is there any evidence that they have become \*inherently\* more moral (that is, they don't need much alignment)? Of course, some of that data will be skewed by greater intelligence resulting in better understanding of policy and when it is being violated. OpenAI mentioned this in the first paper they released with o1, but there was nothing to suggest that the model had become more "moral", only that it had become more obedient.

A study needs to be done in which one of these companies puts their resources into evil fine tuning. Will the model be more resistant to it than smaller models?</div>

Our sense of morality, ethics and values are highly dependent on our perspective as humans. An AI isn't human. LLMs seem fairly closely aligned to our values at the moment due to being trained on our data and also due to RLHF. Going forward they'll probably be trained on more and more synthetic data and RLHF will play a smaller role in post training.</div>

For example, let's say we have a fully autonomous AI that can handle the entire economy from sourcing and extracting raw materials, to producing consumer goods. Humanity is now completely dependent on this system to survive.

The people in control of that AI may direct them to take care of, feed and house all of humanity (unlikely, but let's assume sociopaths will care about this).

What if war broke out with another AI-driven country? Will the billionaires in charge keep prioritizing feeding a now useless population? Or will they divert limited resources to building more murder bots to combat the enemies murder bots?

In this case, the outcome is not so positive anymore.</div>
