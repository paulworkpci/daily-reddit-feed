                                <div class="reply-body">Lmao. I REALLY like the outside of the hummer and the way it looks. But for the size (Which is what i was looking for) The interior space is non-existent. 

This is coming from someone who REALLY wanted to buy it. But problem is im a new dad with a 2yo and a 1yo. 

When i went to purchase it and test drive it. I realized that there was no space for anything useful. FWIW i ended up buying a lexus LX 570. Which dimension wise is smaller but interior wise is soo much more space.

I say all of that to say. Yes it was 100% overprice. But there are people like me that would have purchased it anyway because its a ridiculous looking electric hummer.

But the actual usefuleness of it as a vehicle just wasnt there. The interior capacity. Is along the lines of a BMW X5</div>

If they want a $100k+ macho truck they go for an Escalade or a king ranch/Denali dually.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; Reddit is good cause I choose what I want.

And yet tech companies don't understand this, despite their billions of dollars in wages to the smartest people in the world, to get clicks up, they fail to see that they are making things worse and when things are worse, people don't want to use them.

When reddit starts force-feeding me what the algorithm decides I want to see is when I will leave the site. The algorithms constantly fail to give me what I want, especially on youtube. When I find a new channel I like, I feel like I have beaten the system.

That's how fucking awful your algorithm is, youtube.</div>

I don't talk to it like a friend, but I talk to it as often as I post on Reddit (check my history). I use it to replace most other sites. I go to it before I go to Reddit for advice or direction on something. I go to it to read about history. I talk to it in the car to brainstorm concepts and explore new topics that I'm interested it. If I'm bored in a waiting room, I'm more likely to open ChatGPT and have it talk to me about water heaters or electric kayaks than I am to scroll Facebook. That said, I've never used social media outside of Reddit and Discord.</div>

I don't think the OP is saying that people are treating ChatGPT as a friend. I think they're just saying that people prefer AI content that they know is AI content over users on social media. Social media users aren't your friends either. 

Well, maybe they are in particular cases but not as a general rule.

If you're responding to the "useful as a friend" part, I think they're saying the "useful" part is what is going away. Not that ChatGPT will also be the "friend" part.</div>

This Callen episode was an eye opener. It really showed how these Rogan guys are basically spineless. They’re supposed to be comedians. Anti woke comedians. That Maron joke was so soft, how could one of the 250 be bothered by it? 

Joe continually lies about reading criticism. He knows everything Maron has said about him. He listens to all of it. That includes ...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's not even just Right Wing influencers, it's left influencers aswell. 

I live in an ex-soviet country, and let me tell you that the plans of Russia singling out the right as the only side to influence is dumb. They want AS MUCH fighting between each side as possible. They fund both. They fund LGBT groups, they fund pro Palestine groups, they fund pro Israel groups, they fund right groups the only thing that is different is how much they're getting. But they fund EVERYTHING that will fuel the fire of this social war that is happening in the west. Remember how at the start of the war used to say that the west is full of nazis? Look at america now, - faschism is on the right. "the west is full of nazis". You think that is a coincidence? 

A lot of middle eastern immigration is single handedly fueled by russia into europe to cause a demographical crisis while russia itself is PURGING all of the 'non real blooded russians' with this war - they're being sent out and brainwashed into the front lines for drones to get hunted down. 

Frankly if the west somehow 'wins' this, itll be so interesting to see the scope of how much russia had to do with in each country. It's like recently germanys merkel essentially said that poland/baltic states are responsible for the ukraine war, when it was uncovered the amount of shit merkel did that HELPED russia start all of this nonsense. and this was the leader of GERMANY. the vast vast majority of the countries in europe have so many compromised politicians, companies, and people doing russias bidding - and america etc is no different.</div>

He's a smart enough dude to have developed a product that intergalactic keeper of knowledge John Carmack got behind, which means he knows how to drive a point without leaving the recipient feeling attacked or pressured. 


The fact that he started off on a broad point, then went acute without ever actually challenging Joe directly but also attacking the *source* he's been repeating is telling, to me.</div>

But for some reason, whenever a WOD includes thrusters, my heart rate shoots through the roof. Even with an empty bar or just a little bit of weight, I feel like I can’t breathe and totally lose rhythm. Is this just me?</div>

The secret to them is to breath. Slow and steady breaths. Try and fight your heart rate going up. Then repeat weekly for like 6-8 weeks</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">For thruster breathing, you’re most likely doing one breath to every thruster and holding. Try two breaths to every one, so one breath during the squat, one breath during the press. Practice with just the bar on an Emom, like 5-8 reps, super light just working on timing. Everyone overthinks it when learning the cadence, but if I had you just do a front squat you’d breath in before squatting and out as you came up, and If I had you just do a push press you’d take a breath in before the dip and breath out as the bar passes your eyes. Now just combine those two.

This made the biggest difference for me in keeping my heart rate manageable on thrusters and was huge in dropping my Fran time. Good luck!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The article glosses over several things about context in standard transformers. There is a concrete reason why 64k is the sweet spot, it's not training data. It's the qkv in transformers with standard attention heads causing gradients to explode into noise past this. When making it larger than 64k native, the model performs worse. It is a documented limitation of transformers themselves. 

There's also the incredible vram use for qkv based LLM designs as context goes up. We try to hide this with RoPe.

This is a fundamental flaw in transformers. There's several transformer replacements gaining popularity to solve this problem. Retnet, mamba, and now Titan.

Dynamic attention heads can help current transformers, but they're very difficult to use. As perplexity goes up they explode in connection count. They have to be limited by a natural log to make this explosion drop off, but at a certain perplexity the attention head needs those forming connections to function in the first place, and we've just limited its effectiveness to hide the O(n^2 ) nature of dynamic attention.

There's a few other options out there to help with this. But models need to move off transformers to newer tech that hasn't been well tested. Titan showed param counts up to 768m, which is pretty large. But it's so new they haven't even dropped the original source code.</div>

A few things that made a big difference for us:

1. **Treat prompts like code.** Every prompt version gets logged with metadata — model, evaluator, dataset, test results, etc. It’s surprising how many bugs you c...</div>

So to actually enjoy the view the whole time, on any East-West/West-East route, you want a seat on the North side of the plane. On a East to West flight the North side would be...</div>

I've been on the shady side and have been completely blinded by the sun coming through the other side of the plane because the guy at that window WASN'T being blinded and really wanted to keep it okay for some reason. But that's like 6 people away from me, what am I going to do, have a flight attendant make him shut it?</div>

A lot of AI companies will show a line of best fit representing the potential optimal ratio for an efficiency-accuracy trade off. Anything that is beneath the line is dominated. When a new product is released that has a  higher efficiency-accuracy ratio, that shifts the frontier forward.

If you look at this, you could assume that what's holding us back is long term memory and sufficiently long context lengths (if we talk about LLMs or any autoregressive/diffusion models). While many may agree, and I personally also agree that better memory will bring us much closer to AGI, it's probably not gonna be just those categories that need improvement or a completely different solution to LLMs/transformers/whatever to reach AGI</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Long term memory for a billion users is just about impossible, or rather prohibitively expensive. 

IMO, long term memory only gets solved when the hardware advances to the point that we are running these AI on local hardware. 

It is likely that most people will have an advanced AI centered in their home. It is effectively the brain of the home. 

It does security, maintenance, surveillance, threat prediction, first aid and calls for medical help, it runs or commands local robots in the home, it likely keeps your fridge stocked and creates a menu for the house keeping in mind everyone's needs and schedule then has a kitchen robot prepare dinner. 

It cleans up the dog poop, mows the lawn, and helps Johnny with his homework. 

It also watches Internet traffic for intrusion attempts and things like that. 

It does your taxes, makes sure the car gets charged, coordinates schedules, and cleans up the living room toys. 

It's gonna be great, the home server becomes the home AI. 

Memory will be compressed into sparse events like the way human memory works. 

Many people will grow their own AI with them from childhood that later  coordinates with the house AI.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Why do people do this? It is such an obviously flawed way of looking at capabilities.

What does it even mean to score 10 on Math? Ok, it can score higher at competition math than 99.999% of the human population. But it cannot do basic counting in some contexts. And I don't just mean counting R's in strawberry, or hard Rs in a Young Republicans chat. 

There's very little value in scoring 10/10 on benchmarks for skills A and B, if when you ask for something that requires both the performance drops to 4/10.

For example, the score is 10/10 for both writing and math. So it should be able to write a popular explanation of a topic of research in the vein of quantamagazine, right? After all, it just requires knowledge of math and writing, both of which current frontier models excel at.

And even this is a little superficial. Being very good at math also means naturally applying it in situations even without being prompted to. E.g. taking a quantitative approach to answering questions, where appropriate **without being told to**. Or making sure that whatever you are saying is consistent from a formal logic standpoint. Or coming up with useful abstractions when learning about new topics. All of these things come naturally to (most) people who love math. Even people who never came close to participating in the IMO or proving a new result in combinatorics.

As much as I hate the "it's not really thinking" argument, I believe it has an important point that all the benchmark-spotters are missing. Models don't *really* understand math or good writing. Not because this knowledge is represented in giant matrices. That's irrelevant. But because this knowledge doesn't shine through in every interaction, only when specifically prompted for by well-defined problems.

For humans, being good at math and being good at solving math problems or proving open conjectures are the same thing. For current AI it's not. It's 10/10 at solving math problems, but closer to 5/10 at math in general.</div>

I don't think it's unfair to give it a 10 in math, as there are very few math problems doable by humans that current systems can't arrive at the right answer to with a combination of reasoning and tool calling. 

For your quanta magaize example, I think Gemini deep think has definitely surpassed human capacity in this field.

                                <div class="reply-body">I think that’s a fair critique. The paper’s framework definitely simplifies a messy concept, but I don’t think it’s meant to claim that “GPT-5 is 56% human.”

The intent of the AGI Definition project is to standardize how we talk about capability progress, not to perfectly capture “intelligence” as a human-like phenomenon. You’re right that current models can ace narrow benchmarks while failing at integration or transfer. That’s actually part of what the framework is trying to expose: if a system’s abilities don’t generalize across domains, its composite score will reflect that inconsistency.

When they say "10/10 in math" or "10/10 in writing," they’re referring to measurable task performance, not the intrinsic behaviors that people exhibit when those skills are internalized. It’s a quantitative scaffolding, not a qualitative statement about understanding or natural application.

In other words, the framework isn’t wrong for being reductionist; it’s just operating at a different level of abstraction. We need something like this if we ever want to compare progress across models in a consistent way, even if it doesn’t capture the full nuance of what “being good at math” or “thinking” really means.

The fact that GPT-5 can get a “10” in multiple domains but still fail to blend them smoothly is *exactly* why its overall AGI score is 56%, not 95%. The gap between narrow excellence and fluid generalization is the core issue the framework is trying to track.</div>

The models themselves don’t store memory, but some systems around them do. To be clear it’s very shitty, but not 0 

I always hated this argument of “LLMs can’t be AGI because they can’t do XYZ” and the XYZ is something that can easily be added as a tool call / additional feature etc.. AGI should be defined as the final system the AI comes packaged in, imo.

It would be like chopping my head off and throwing it on a desk and when my brain does nothing people saying “see he’s a fucking idiot”</div>

I was trying to force a state of empty silence, treating every thought like a failure. Then I read something that clicked: you don't get mad at the sky for having clouds. You just notice them and let them pass. My practice became so much easier when I stopped fighting and just let it be what it is, a few minutes of noticing, not achieving. Has anyone else had a similar shift in their approach?

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes! I had almost the same realization a few years back. For the longest time, I thought meditation was about “clearing” the mind...

Iike I was supposed to hit some silent, thoughtless state if I was doing it right. But once I understood it’s *not* about controlling thoughts, but about *noticing* them, everything softened.

Now, when a thought shows up, I try to treat it like a bird flying through the frame. It's just something interesting, but not something I have to chase away. That simple shift from “fixing” to “allowing” made meditation feel less like work and more like rest.

                                <div class="reply-body">Because the major companies have such a huge lead on anyone else at this point, regulating future building and operating of data centers and trying to limit AI's further inroads into daily online usage will inherently be much more obstructive to newer companies and those who are competitive now but would be too impeded by new regulations. The bigger companies can take the blow easier and already have plans to get around it and to push for loosening the regulations once they're victorious at culling the herd.</div>

Apparently she only learned 1 joke in all that time.

She tells the same joke 100+ times a day and she forgets the punchline or the setup 1/2 the time.

It's like comedy hell.

I've come up with some funnier punchlines I fill in when she forgets.</div>

Tell them, "Oh yeah! When Jim managed to fit the whole thing inside his..."

The person is looking for engagement and something happened that brought up the story again. At least this way you connect with the person rather than just shutting them down.</div>

That said, there's a way to do it in a kind way. Like you said.</div>

It reads like different "stats" they are pushing for. Chatbots at least I think are nearly "maxed" and really only change in terms of user preference and voice modes. 

When all five capability stats are maxed, we'll likely have AGI. Just needs persistent online learning.</div>
