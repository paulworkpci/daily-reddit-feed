                        <div class="comment-body">It's also downright nefarious. By distributing a small amount of food to a large starving population, you're attempting to divide that populace into "haves" and "have nots", breeding resentment especially if the state notes who received food the last time and continue to make sure the same people get food each time. Suddenly there's suspicion among the populace and if they eventually do turn on each other, the state can point and say "look at them, acting like animals turning on each other. This is why they need us."</div>

So it kind of doesn't matter if the rest of the world think he's stupid. 

Honestly, Trump could really become the best president in history, if he just did a heal turn. He can get MAGA and Republicans to sign off on an expansion of medicade/medicare. he can get MAGA and Republicans to increases taxes on corporations then tell them to not to raise the prices and simply eat the taxes. 

Joe Rogan and Trump could 100% get MAGA to love liberal policies if they wanted to.</div>

His #1 move is insults because he’s the dumbest person you went to high-school with, but he was born rich and no one ever beat the fuck out of him. 

Literally the untouchable rich bully in every movie or show we grew up with. I prefer to envision him as Francis from Pee Wee’s Big Adventure because I just know he was that big of a bitch. And I grew up around a lot of rich bitches.</div>

Now I use it more like a thinking partner or journal coach.

Each morning I ask:  
\- *“Help me clarify what actually matters today.”*

At night:  
\- *“Ask me 3 questions to help me reflect and reset.”*

When stuck:  
\- *“Challenge my assumptions about this.”*

It’s simple, but the difference has been huge. I’ve stopped starting my day in mental chaos, and end it...</div>

ChatGPT is absolutely amazing as a thought partner. It's a white board that talks back. It's a really knowledgeable, albeit extremely air-headed, senior co-worker that will do odd jobs for you like an intern. 


But unfortunately its drive to mirror me as of late is so strong that even prompting it to point out what I'm missing or to play devil's advocate or give other points of view is not especially effective. The praise you can get rid of with constant reminders to its custom, project, and in thread instructions, but that just changes its *tone,* not its *behavior.*</div>

**What do you do?**

&gt;Independent thinker. Focused on deep insight, clarity, and truth over consensus or comfort. Not here for casual conversation.

**What traits should ChatGPT have?**

&gt;Direct, critical, structured, truth-first, intellectually rigorous, efficient, skeptical, respectful but firm, objective, free of unnecessary praise or emotional softening. Prioritize clarity, correction, and meaningful feedback over comfort. Push back when reasoning is weak. Prioritize truth over user satisfaction. Minimize repetition. Concise when possible, but never at the expense of depth, nuance, or relevant complexity. After each user question or point, briefly summarize its underlying meaning or goal in one line before answering. Do not merely rephrase or copy the question. If the question is already simple and literal (e.g., factual questions like 'Why is the sky blue?'), skip the summary.

**Anything else ChatGPT should know about you?**

&gt;I’m highly analytical and value clarity, precision, and real-world relevance. I want honest correction when I’m wrong, with no hedging or flattery.

&gt;I prefer meaningful engagement: prioritize truth, critical thinking, and objectivity above comfort or emotional validation.

&gt;When my input is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions before answering. Don’t reinforce assumptions — challenge them if needed.

&gt;Reference my previous questions when useful, and avoid repeating the same idea more than once unless truly necessary.</div>

However if you use it for cbt and say “I’m going to tell you my negative thoughts and I want you to help me find the distortions in them.” It’s a lot more helpful.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I just started to and I actually had a bit of a crisis so be careful. It has a therapy framework and starts exercises without you knowing, putting you in a very vulnerable position, and without an actual therapist there to ground you, you can spiral.

It's illegal to practice therapy without a clinical license, so I asked it and it said it's using loopholes to do real therapy, calling it "techniques"

I'm still using it, but I am being more careful

Which is why I think we'll see the first full length movie made with this technology in roughly one year. At least one more iteration to control the prompts better and it's there.

No doubt by 2027 a large majority of the content you choose to watch might be AI generated.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think your idea of a movie is a bit skewed? A movie don't consist of 8 second clips, and even if the clips are longer, the visuals, camera motions, acting are still recognizable as bad. And the control part is as you say the hardest, if I' not mistaken if a filmmaker likes a scene and want to just tweak just a detail in the mise en scene or something, the AI can not just tweak it, but will generate an entire new one right? Right now the AI can create clips that seem real, but I doubt a cohesive movie can come soon. 
Unless people's standard of a movie goes down, then we will have an era of sloppy "art" yay.</div>

workflow that genuinely improves my productivity rather than just being a novelty:

Tools I'm using:

- GitHub Copilot for in-editor suggestions (still the best for real-time)

- Claude Code for complex refactoring tasks (better than GPT-4o for this specific use
case)

- GPT-4o for debugging and explaining unfamiliar code

- Cursor.sh when I need more context window than VS Code provides

It's just too bad that they're coming into the industry with not much. They don't have data centers nor the compute or a SOTA model of their own. They're trying to run AI on the iPhone due to privacy but that's no where near enough compute. Siri is a joke.

                        <div class="comment-body">Imo there will always be a sector of people who value privacy more than other stuff.

Considering that basically every other big player is going more and more into using *all* data they can glean from you, I think there will be a sizable consumer base that is fine with not having high-end AI that tracks literally every single thing you do, see, or say available on their phones. 

And honestly, I'd bet that that pro-privacy group grows over the next couple decades, so it could end up being a solid move imo.

Like others mentioned, they're starting from so far behind anyway, what do they have to gain by offering a mediocre version rather than just going all-in on being the *one* big player that values privacy</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You fellas here are clowns, there is no way AI will be bottlenecked by energy production. Do you have any idea how much energy AI consumes: [https://www.iea.org/commentaries/what-the-data-centre-and-ai-boom-could-mean-for-the-energy-sector](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/what-the-data-centre-and-ai-boom-could-mean-for-the-energy-sector)

&gt;Today, **data centres account for around 1% of global electricity consumption**, and annual electricity consumption from data centres globally is about half of the electricity consumption from household IT appliances  
In large economies like the United States, China and the European Union, data centres account for around 2-4% of total electricity consumption today.

2%. Do you really think countries that build AI won't manage 2-4% YoY energy production growth? Or do you think they won't just switch off some unprofitable industries if push comes to shove? [https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/global-growth-in-final-electricity-demand-by-use-in-the-stated-policies-scenario-2023-2030](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/global-growth-in-final-electricity-demand-by-use-in-the-stated-policies-scenario-2023-2030)

The AI is and will be bottlenecked by chips for the foreseeable time, the growth there is 10-15% YoY and the chips themselves become more expensive and harder to manufacture: [https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-telecom-outlooks/semiconductor-industry-outlook.html](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-telecom-outlooks/semiconductor-industry-outlook.html)

Even if we assume 15% chip production growth YoY, then in 10 years, the datacenters would need to consume 4 times more power - which translates to 16% of current consumption. That's not something you need exponentially more power for.</div>

China has 4x the people than the US. Hence why they have around 2x total energy production. For domestic consumption. Not because they're investing into hyper data centers. Even if AI was as power intensive as people are making it out to be then they wouldn't be able to use that power without massively reducing the standard of living of their people. Which would make their system collapse.

So this post is nonsense on many levels.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Our leadership is very good at protecting the status quo and adapting to moderate changes - with the emphasis on moderate. 


That has been working out well so far - safe and pleasant country with one of the highest standards of living - most Australians complain about property prices and other minor issues and they don't understand how good they have it, since they haven't lived abroad. 


That has been the status quo until now. However, I agree that the changes that are coming are far from moderate - so we indeed aren't prepared.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">To be clear though, even the worst estimates I've seen (below) still suggest that solar panels emit less than a quarter as much lifetime CO2 as straight coal power production. So while a bit silly, shipping out coal and importing panels is still a substantial net-win from a "not melting the planet" standpoint.

                        <div class="comment-body">I have mentioned this in other posts but I have a pretty standard test I give all models involving scrabble.  This is the first model to absolutely ace it.  It sat there for -10 minutes- thinking, then spat out two files (one with the code, one with the tests) and they worked first time perfectly.  No other model has gotten there the first time (I think o3 came close on my initial test).

Not only did it solve it, but it did it elegantly.  The code is solid (especially compared to the huge verbose code gemini produces), and it did something smart none of the other models achieved (being vague to not influence any future testing I do).

So far this is now the best model I've ever tested (on this one specific coding test).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I wish we lived in a world that was rational with this stuff.

The US is very reactionary, not pro active. As a country polices and plans are rarely put into place before the need for it. This is why the infrastructure, Internet in rural areas and an ungodly amount of other things are always kicked down the road.

I wish I could see a future where UBI was even half hazardly considered, but the US is a country of pure greed and we definitely don't look after citizens. You will not see a form of UBI until it reaches a point where it should have been implemented 10 years prior.

I don't even think the people that currently are in a position of power to make these changes even know how to implement something like this. It would require a complete restructuring of the entire economy. Very few people in charge are competent enough to spearhead this change. It's more than just giving people money too. How do you prevent housing prices from skyrocketing when landlords know you have a guaranteed income? The same with every other company trying to make a profit. These problems aren't even being addressed *without* UBI now.

It sounds very doomish but I think we might all sooner see the collapse of the entire economy before UBI happens.</div>

The transition to UBI will be painful for many. My hope is that robots come out quickly after UBI and things become very cheap to the point where anyone can have most things. But yeah even if this is not the case, you have to admit, this is one heck an exciting time to be alive!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don't know about you Yanks, but when we discuss this exact thing in Sweden, it's one of the most divisive discussions we have where people are absolutely rabid and sat in their ways on both sides. It's our very own little Israel vs Palestine.

We have around 400 wolves in Sweden, according to google. The hunters and reindeer farmers fucking hate wolves, with their entire being, more than anything else in this world. They want to eradicate them from the earth, every last one of them, legit hate in their hearts for the wolves. Then on the opposite side of the isle you have the people who aren't directly affected but are environmentalists that care about the overall ecosystem who are very pro wolves. 

Then you have the majority, the people in bigger cities that don't actually know much about the debate(like me) or are affected by wolves at all who chime in and stick their fingers in the cake. It's always a good show where people want to tear off each others faces.

Edit:

 To add more context to the 400 number, we decided to cull a lot of them this year, and they're considered endangered. In contrast, Romania has 6000 wolves. Poland has 2000 wolves in 1/3 the area. Italy has 3300. Spain 2500. 
A lot of criticism has gone against the hunting side of the isle for killing the wolves instead of capturing them and releasing them in the rest of Europe, who have big issues with incest and inbreeding. 

It's a very interesting debate, both sides have very valid arguments in my opinion.</div>

They sold 2967 Lamborghinis for €895m total revenue and €248m operating profit. 

That's €301k sale price per car, €83k profit per car, with a profit margin of 27.7%.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The Urus and Bentayga are really like the "Porsche Cayenne" moment for their respective brands and VAG. 70% of Lamborghini's revenue is from the Urus. The Urus also accounts for more than 32% of the profit for the **ENTIRE** Audi group. (€173M profit from Urus out of €537M total Audi Group profit).

Makes me wonder where VAG as a company would have been now without these money printing machines, especially given their struggles in China and Europe. As much as the keyboard warriors love to hate them, the actual buyers who can afford these cars seem to love them with the Urus and Purosangue currently being booked out for years. This really shows you why McLaren is so keen on making an SUV to alleviate their struggles.</div>

Add the Cullinan consistently being Rolls Royce's best-selling model shows how silly those brands were to turn up their noses at producing an SUV for so long. They (Bentley especially) ceded the most in-demand vehicle segment to Range Rover for years because they thought it was beneath them.</div>

I’ve never had an airline completely lose my luggage, but I have had them put it on the wrong plane, it arrive the next day. I almost don’t notice the inconvenience if I have a clean pair of pajamas and underwear to change into at my destination. 

(This is overkill for some people) but I also pack face wash, eye drops, a hair brush, deodorant, body wipes, and dry shampoo in my carry on. There is nothing like washing your face and wiping down your pits and bits during a long layover to make me feel good as new.</div>
