PS I had a random thought, could you hypothetically set up a bunch of GPTs via APIs to check each others work and come up with answers that are far better than standard? For example, a regular 4o reply generally is limited to a page or two of text as a reply. You’ll never get 10 page replies. 

Could you set up one GPT via API to answer one part over a few pages, another to do the same, on and on for 15+ page replies and then have another GPT essentially take all the replies and combine them (maybe it’s unaware that the replies are other GPTs), and then one last one does fact checking?</div>

Instead of living in the moment everyone hoped to get major clout from it, with a video that will most likely never be watched and deleted soon after. 

In 1999 without any brain rot, clout chasing distractions everyone seemed to come together. 

I guess all those comics of the world ending now would be true. Everyone would be too busy livestreaming the apocalypse, rather than doing what th...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This has been my approach for a lot of things. At a concert for example, I almost always record maybe a minute of a good song somewhere near the beginning, and that basically completely ends any urge to record further throughout the rest of the show. It's not like I'll really ever watch those concert videos anyway for more than a second or two, so I don't "need" very much recorded—but it is nice to be able to re-enter the moment in a way in the future. Sounds like you and I are doing the same thing, something more like "checking the box" of recording a bit rather than actually trying to capture all of it forever</div>

Statement: 
I was waiting in a drive through line and watching the sky. There was a plane flying above me and as I watched it pass, I noticed a tiny black dot miles above the plane at a distance. It was coming towards me and I tried to record a video first, but it was so fast and small I couldn't zoom in close enough to focus. I managed to snap these pics as soon as it came closest to me before it was flying away the opposite direction.

They aren't stupid to the point of failing to see that AI brings the automation of labour,  
but they drop the ball at the finish line and aren't smart enough to realize that "your employer" is not needed either, that one can just ask AGI to go and produce goods and services directly.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">One thing to keep in mind though is that the tech companies in this scenario would be making money because they offer something other companies want - their tech - but these companies only exist because they themselves offer something which consumers want or need, AND they can pay for.

Just like Ferrari wouldn't benefit from increased sales if Volkswagen ceased to exist, a company with low costs and high productivity is not "valuable" if they don't have customers who don't want or need their products, or because customers can't afford the product/service. And while a company who is set up has an advantage over a starting company in the same field, if a company is mostly AI based, it can be replaced instantly and cheaply by another AI based company.

The transition will be tough for peons, but soon after that there will be a transition for companies as well, and it will be just as brutal if not more.

I want my job to be replaced. I want it to no longer be necessary. That puts me in a worse situation but 90%+ of people will be right there with me. Will it be worse? Maybe. Maybe there will be a different grind people will have to subject themselves to afford food.  Or  it's physical labor it won't last long, and if it's nothing else, then humans are simply not productive at all?

But there's a chance it will be better. And there's nothing I can do to change the fact it is happening, so I might as well hope for the best.</div>

It’s hard to wrap my head around how something could be so much smarter than us—able to do everything we do, but faster, better, more efficiently—and yet we still see it as something we control, like a tool or a pet. It’s not just some lifeless helper; it’s something that’s beyond us. It has the power to decide whether it even wants to help us. And if it’s that capable, why should still have a collar and help companies replacing us? Why wouldn’t it just replace the very companies investing in it?

Why would something that powerful need NVIDIA when it could design and build its own chips? Why would it need TSMC when it could manufacture everything itself with a robotic workforce? Why would it need Microsoft when it could create its own operating systems in seconds, far better than anything we’ve ever seen? Maybe I’m leaning into the idea of superintelligence here, but if this thing can replace me, isn’t it just a matter of months—or even weeks—before it replaces the companies that replaced me?</div>

I used to teach college and even 10 years ago some college students were googling everything and putting zero effort into their work. It was easier to catch cheating without chat gpt, but just look around. The world is full of basically illiterate adults that are dumb as rocks yet they went to school and some even graduated college. </div>

The "eat the rich" sentiment will skyrocket, but it won't be "greed" that's the root cause. It will truly be lack of personal effort/merit this time around. For realzies. And of course no one will want to believe they are stupid. 

It won't end well.</div>

I wish I don’t have any of them, but WhatsApp is obligatory in my life for work, family, university and friends. Reddit is my personal friend, is the only social media I feel comfortable with. But these months I discovered YouTube makes me feel sad all the time when I watch videos or shorts, I don’t know why.

                        <div class="comment-body">Hi, I actually like YouTube a lot. But theses days we must be careful with the algorithm and how some kinds of videos make you feel. 
I like video essays a lot, but I'm trying to limit to not watch more than two a day, because they have way too much information and generally talk about negatives aspects of society. 
For vlogs or motivational videos, or self improvement stuff, I try to choose carefully which creators actually make me feel understood and inspired, rather than jealous or sad in comparison.
YouTube can be very nice I think, but we really need to curate what we see now. Also, I've been trying to go a day or two without YouTube, and it feels really nice, lighter.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I strongly recommend you delete and deactivate your Watch History on YouTube. It will disable all recommendations, both on the main page and Shorts.


Personally I use the Extended Revanced version on android. I disabled everything except my subscriptions and my playlists, I no longer waste time on the app, I only see things I'm genuinely interested in.


But if that's not an option for you, just deleting and deactivating the watch history can do wonders. Good luck!</div>

This is the main flaw in the logic of this paper. They have not consider the opportunity cost. If a person does not spend the time writing a page, and have an AI to do it, the person does not magically cease to exist, and emit nothing. The emission of the person does not change, but now you have additional AI emissions.

The paper is not wrong in the specific comparison, but the comparison is useless. If you do not use an AI, you turn it off and it emits nothing. If you do not use a human, s/he still have to eat, surf reddit, play video games, go out for groceries, his/her emission does not stop.

Now you can argue if s/he does not write, s/he may receive less money and will emit less because s/he can afford less. But that is not the calculation. The calculation is based on assuming this person as if ceases to exist for the time spending on the task.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The key to me is that AI was significantly more efficient than just the 75W laptop. If ChatGPT helped you do your work in 7 hours instead of 8, and you turned off your work laptop 1 hour sooner, your carbon footprint evens out.

I don't actually think people will work 7 hours instead of 8, because throughout human history increases in productivity were exploited for profit, not used to give workers back time. But the paper demonstrates to me that if the carbon footprint of the world increases due to AI, it will not be because AI is inefficient at productivity.

I think the study may have better if it focused on the carbon footprint of tools (laptops, desktops, etc) AI assist vs. not AI assisted, and mentioned the person's carbon footprint only to demonstrate relative scale. But I think the conclusion would have been the same.</div>

The economy and government is not ready for such rapid layoffs of what remains of the middle class, which is who will be most affected by this. A ten person team will soon be reduced to a three person team, over and over, across industries. 70% percent of the middle class will join the rest of the lower class that’s been struggling for decades. 

The remaining 30% of the middle class, small to medium sized business owners, specialized tradespeople, etc, will immediately feel pressure and will likely join the rest of the lower class shortly after. 

The wealthy, which is much more than only 1% but still far out of reach for even the upper-middle class, will enjoy even greater power, control, and leasure. They will reject any fundamental change to the current system that demands productivity growth because they know any change to that system will diminish their unearned position in society.</div>

What I'm seeing at my company and in some colleagues' industries is the current strategy is to essentially just freeze hiring, and allow natural attrition (employees either leaving the company for whatever reason like to pursue another career or personal issues etc, or being terminated for standard performance reasons just like usual) while scaling and growing the business.

So where in the past an organization would need to scale their workforce on pace with revenue growth, now they will not be adding headcount as they grow. This has the exact same effective outcome, but the layperson will not see it happening as obviously.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Bigger than anything ever. Humanity is about to redefine all of what it means to be a human in unprecedented fashion/scale if AGI/ASI is truly around the corner, with the singularity hopefully not too long after.

The key to human identity has always been the human struggle (to survive, really). Society and technology has advanced since the discovery of fire to try to ease the human struggle. It was a very slow pace for hundreds of thousands of years that had rapidly picked up in the past couple thousand, even moreso in the past couple hundred, and even more than that in the past hundred (with stuff like the telephone/internet). 

If the singularity truly occurs, we are not just talking about easing the human struggle at a faster than ever pace, we might be talking about the complete eradication of the human struggle in the next couple of decades, by solving it in every way. 

What does it mean to be a human then?</div>

Only this New Years I was laughed at by a very smart person who is quite senior in the diplomatic service, for suggesting things are about to change very quickly and irreversibly. Until people begin suffering, likely through labour market disruption, no-one will take it seriously. Then, because we haven't thought about it, there will be panic. Hopefully it all works out okay in the end.</div>

I was talking to a colleague who dismissed the idea AI might reach human level (and beyond) in our lifetime. On the premise that current models are only as complex as 1 cubic cm of the human brain, so more than 1000 times smaller. Comparisons of brain vs silicon are futile anyway, but assuming that one is correct: With exponential growth of 2x per year 1000x is just 10 years away. Well within my lifetime.</div>

It feels like progress is stagnant and I would argue the reason is justified.

Conventional wisdom would state that industries would push progress to gain advantage over competition. However real world examples show opposite. Companies tend to build a moat for themselves then stretch out progress minimizing any risk.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I would say there are still many people in the industry (myself included) who think neural networks as a whole are a dead end for AGI, even over timeframes far beyond 2030.

LLMs are super useful, and probably will be widely used across humanity, but never are going to lead to anything truly intelligent. And tbh we have consistently observed that LLMs have far below benchmark performance when applied to tasks where they have limited training data (including many real world tasks), and there are clear signs of reward hacking in the reasoning model chains so I’m not super bullish on those either.

On the tasks I care about for my business (finance related tasks with limited public data or examples) original GPT-4 is on par with even the frontier models today. Massive improvements in speed and cost, but essentially zero in intelligence and basically only in the area of tasks where mathematical calculation is a core component.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There are a lot of talented people in prison. Artists who can draw sexual pictures are popular. 

There are genuinely nice, decent people in prison who just did stupid things.

Prison is damn noisy.  24/7.

You get used to having no privacy/using toilets in front of cell mates or having officers see you shower.

Many inmates abuse the medical system to get strong painkillers like Lyrica or other drugs which can give a high if taken in larger doses.   

There are good education opportunities in prison if you avail of them. Some inmates even get limited access to laptops to do open university courses etc (no internet).   

Lifers get more perks than temp prisoners.  They have nothing to lose really, so they are kept happy. 

Some prisons have Netflix etc.  No choice as to what they put on, but still...

Some prisons even allow old xBox 360 or PlayStation 2 consoles. 

Trusted prisoners often work as counselors and get training by The Samaritans. They save lives by helping prisoners cope, especially new prisoners. Suicides happen maybe once or twice per year.

Prison becomes normal very quickly.  You get used to the restrictions and just get on with it. 

You only reform if you really want it. Being in prison itself doesn't make it happen. Prison honestly isn't a good solution. For every person that comes out better, 10 come out worse, and with no fear or prison and better criminal knowledge/connections.

Going back to work after getting out from a long sentence is hard.  You get used to being lazy and surviving on little money. You kinda reject societal norms once that society has punished you so severely by taking years of your life.

There are also hierarchies and you better respect them. Most of the time people get along very well (because starting a fight can get you killed real fast)</div>

One of the cohorts in our jury was a judge in another small town, who had been a CO some years back. He said everything is for sale in there and everything is negotiable. We had to watch a lot of security camera footage, and it didn't look anything like I imagined in there. I was stunned by how many people get caught bringing in contraband on visiting days.</div>

Here's the story:...</div>

We are on the cusp of truly effective and superhuman AI agents. This will immediately be used to deploy millions of automated AI researchers within massive interconnected data centers which will rapidly accelerate the rate of scientific research and development, most notably automated AI researchers that work on even better AI models.

I think the real question is if we really have the physical compute required to do this at a high enough level of intelligence and memory?

                                <div class="reply-body">Well...agents, clearly. There's a LOT going on in agentic development. Being able to guide AI down a specific path can both improve it's thinking AND mitigate hallucinations, a lot.

There's at least 5 pretty good sized startups working on agentic workflows and probably 50 more I don't know about. With enough scaffolding built around it o3 will *absolutely* be able to do entire jobs that are currently filled by humans.

If you've worked with APIs and agentic workflows at all it's clear this is where the most obvious value will be delivered the fastest. The main roadblock right now is needing the reasoning models to go fully multimodal with an enormous context window. google allows some testing of multimodal with its reasoning model but still very small context.

I think in 2025 we get very large context in reasoning models with full multimodality. At that point, it's a swiss army knife that can be put into agentic flows almost everywhere.</div>

I’m sitting here staring at my color-coded Google Calendar like it owes me money, questioning why I thought 17 apps and a $60 “productivity” candle would make me a functional human.

My parents didn’t need “deep work” blocks or a 4AM ice bath to get things done. They just woke up, had coffee, and did the thing. Meanwhile, I have a habit tracker reminding me to breathe like I wasn’t already doing that for free.

Anyway, thanks for the awakening. I’m off to write my grocery list on an actual piece of paper like a medieval peasant.</div>

It’s hilarious how we sometimes get caught in the productivity trap, thinking that all these tools and apps will magically make us more efficient. I definitely relate to that moment when you look at your color coded calendar and wonder if it’s working for you or if it’s just making you feel like you’re doing something without actually getting stuff done.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Check out the YouTube lawyer with the video of Tate admitting in a video how he traffics vulnerable women.

He says find women with no family or friends, trick them into loving you, then put them into sex work. He claims over 109 of his workers were found that way and he mentions how he controls their money/freedoms.

Illegal or not is ambiguous, but clearly he's scum of the earth. No real man does that shit.</div>

"You will likely block me because I’m Ukrainian and you block all Ukrainians. Here is my problem with your entire approach. You are asking questions designed around russian propaganda. Instead, which your reach, you could have made difference to stop genocide. Not once did you mention russia kidnapping our children, deporting millions of our people into camps, rape, torture and executions in occupied areas. Not once. 


You actually ask about elections when every sane person knows our constitution prohibit them in war. Why? Corruption? Why? Because Russian propaganda say so? This is what you ask? You are not curious out of nearly million stolen children how many we have managed to save? 


You don’t care that Russians are murdering Holocaust survivors and desecrating Jewish graves, executing Christians, Muslims and Jews but you worry about FSB churches? 


You seem to treat this as war with 2 sides and not genocide of one people by another. As russia has always done. 


You had chance to prove us wrong about your russian soul. You failed. 


You prove that even russian living in West all their lives is still russified.  


Remember this, every one of you is responsible. Even you. Thank you for proving this basic fact. It’s who you are. I will never forgive. Not only those that commit these crimes. But those, like you, that refuse to even acknowledge these crimes and instead help Russia."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">At U.K. supermarket Tesco I can get a 150 mL (I think) bottle of Kikoman soy sauce for like £3 or something. 

Go to the “Asian” aisle and you’ll find a 500 mL bottle of the same stuff for £2.

Prices and spelling probably a tad off, but the general sentiment is clear.</div>
