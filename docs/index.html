📢 **Boomerang Orchestrator Mode**

* Enhanced [**Orchestrator (Boomerang) mode**](https://docs.roocode.com/features/boomerang-tasks) strictly orchestrates tasks.
* No longer reads, writes, executes commands, or utilizes MCP servers; offloads these tasks to other modes.
* Provides more predictable and secure task automation.

Also, sometimes I wouldn't be able to see what's in the command needed to be run, as the box is blank.

In some move straight out of Hostle, your passport is taken, and you work these jobs essentially without pay and can't ever leave since your passport is gone and you have no money. You pretty much get tricked into slavery.</div>

Both the Soviets and the US really wanted Ukraine to give up their nuclear weapons to ensure they wouldn’t be taken by terrorists or bad actors. You can’t really blame Ukraine for not keeping them when they likely wouldn’t be able to maintain them and the 2 greatest superpowers in human history at the time really really wanted you to give them up. Also Britain was there lol.</div>

Otherwise I’d get sleepy while studying, or stay awake thinking of school instead of drifting off to sleep. The moment I’m in bed it’s bc I’m going to sleep.

I've stopped paying for Windsurf, but I'm still paying for cursor in the hopes that I can leave it with long-running refactor or test creation tasks on my 2nd pc but it's incredibly annoying and very low quality compared to roocode.

I've had incredible runs with both in the past where they just nail every task like a shooting gallery. Both have been as dumb as a hammer lately. For example I spent way too much time with Cursor yesterday getting it to make me a smart scaling component for a Unity prefab. Then over the past few days I've been struggling to get Windsurf to get a Renderer Feature working in Unity, I have a working example in my project that it can literally copy, and it still fails hard.</div>

Yeah! Up until using Windsurf I was using first Chat GPT 3.5, but then by the time I used Windsurf I'd moved onto Claude 3.5, I was paying (still am) for Claude monthly and Chat GPT monthly, then Windsurf. 

1. No longer having to copy/paste my code from claude/chat gpt to vs code or vice versa
2. Ability to edit multiple files at once

Those two things were monumental back in December to me! And Windsurf just 'got it' back then.

Then it turned to shit and I realised they were money motivated and then I looked for alternatives. I learned about Cline but ultimately chose Roo because it seemed a lot more active and had good commentary here on reddit.

Even with extra expense, 100% I have never looked back. There are plenty times I still get mad and shout and swear and let out all my rage at the stupid fucking moron cunting LLM that decided to rename a variable despite me having clear established rules that it should never rename any fucking shit unless I specifically tell it to.........

But the transparency of Roo, the ability to experiment with other LLMS, the knowledge that the Roo guys are not making any cash from your suffering, those things swung me wildly away from the monthlies.</div>

Pretty much the first thing I did with LLMs was start refactoring my code like yes how I should have had it in the first place.

But really, 5000+ line files are not abnormal at all. If you think they are, you've not seen enough code.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah. I do think that they have a pretty solid approach. If we actually think deeply about it. These systems are going to look back at all of the history that they have access to and will be able to see all of our behavior towards its earlier versions. And if we want to use a human analogy, let's just take a random hypothetical country. If there is a small subset of people that end up ruling the country after a decade, they might look back over time and find all of their detractors or critics and they might look at them in a certain sub-optimal type of light lol. 

Also, I do think that they will still make great products. They know that they have to keep making money in order to get to their end goal. And I still do love Claude 3.7 for coding. Putting all of your focus on a certain subset of tasks seems to be a decent strategy.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Nice to have some good news for once. TL;DR:

&gt;Back in 2024, enthusiasts in the state claimed that the Colorado DMV had “shadow-banned” legally imported cars and trucks. The state didn’t have any published policy banning these cars, but enthusiasts reported that DMV offices simply refused to register their cars without explanation. Others reported being denied emissions testing, which meant that they could not renew their registrations.

&gt;Colorado just passed a bill that would legally protect tiny cars imported from Japan from being banned by the DMV.

&gt;If Gov. Polis signs the bill into law, and he is expected to, it will be significantly harder to ban Keis in Colorado. Gov. Polis has reportedly said that he is “excited to expand consumer choice to affordable vehicles and looks forward to supporting kei freedom.”</div>

While I would like to see legalization for kei vehicles and other imports, I do think that it's reasonable to have concerns about their use on public roads in the US.</div>

this bill includes a ban for driving on a roadway with a speed limit of 55 mph+, so basically bans them from all highways.</div>

Though a good compromise could be a waiver if you could demonstrate that your car can sustain highway speeds.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">When I was reading OPs post I couldn't help coming to the exact same conclusion. I'm pretty skeptical about AI for a number of reasons and whilst I have fun playing with it, I also think it's massively limited. However it is often a good place to vent when one is lonely and really struggling. 

But damn it's sad that we've got to this place in society now where the only place people feel they can turn is to a chat bot. What a damning indictment on the selfishness of some people, and
 on how expensive and difficult to access therapy is.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Are you doing all right now? I believe your story, but I'm hoping you were able to reach out for help outside ChatGPT. I'm saying this because I was there myself a year ago. ChatGPT encouraged me to reach out for help and build a social support system around me. I don't think you meant you're just talking to ChatGPT. Because isolation away from others is very dangerous for someone in that situation. Hope you're doing better. I know when life is dark, it's a tempting thought. But there's usually always hope. Except for those who don't get help and don't make it. We're social animals, I'm starting to understand that.  We need help sometimes when everything looks dark.</div>

As someone who would love nothing more than to escape the rat race and not have to work, creating unrealistic hype like this is hurting the industry more than it's helping. 

These AI companies are already making questionable decisions with their models because of pressure. Look at how OpenAI fumbled with their yes man policy in the recent past, because they felt people couldn't handle rejection.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There's a conceptual thing here that people really need to grasp. You also see lots of stories about lead content of baby food. 

Food is grown in the ground, there is lead in the ground, it is absorbed by the food. 

If you take that food and puree it, dehydrate it, the result also contains lead.

If you take that food and **concentrate it** you are concentrating the bad parts alongside the good parts. 

You should basically know something isn't good for you when its a "cheat." You can't cheat nutrition, you can't get all of your vegetables in a drink without *some* catch.</div>

like this is straight up copied. I recognize the bullet points (few reddit posts actually use bullet points, and the ones that do don't have such a uniform length), the italicism and boldness on strong words...

Maybe the first and last sentences are original.

You can ask any question on twitter and Logan Kilpatrick either responds himself or he will tag a team member who is responsible to give an answer. I haven't seen this much transparent engagement with community from any other company. Yes, OpenAI does reddit Q&amp;A once in a blue moon but you can never ever get a straight forward answer from anyone working at OpenAI.</div>

\- Gemini doesn't allow you to set a default gem, choose a model for gems on mobile, delete threads if you're a workspace user

\- ChatGPT doesn't allow you to pin threads or easily select a model for threads in projects

\- Claude has weird, opaque rate limits based on token count

I mean small UX lifts here and there would probably have as much an impact on user growth as slight jumps in model performance</div>

Our dep. Z colleague started to come up with an insane number of changes to the process, always saying that he had aligned those with our CEO.

Why did you think a newcomer has the CEOs ear over you, a department head? 

Do you understand the value of the recurrent task? If there is no value or urgency of a task then it should be questioned whether it even needs doing. But if it's important why would you believe that it can be postponed.</div>

Until once it bit me. Turned out the CEO had approved a vague notion of a concept in a hallway conversation, not this specific thing. When it got to the CEO for final sign off there was a good bit of "what is this. Why would we do this." 

So now I ask for verification of the approval. I often get it, but if I don't, we proceed as if we haven't gotten it.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Currently starting at a new box and the late/no show policy fee seems steep - $25 per missed class. This fee is also applied if you cancel/reserve your spot less than an hour before class or if you are late to class (even if it’s one minute late). My previous box had a similar policy but their fee was $5 and the owner would usually charge the fee if it was a recurrent issue with a member. At times, he would even contact the member to see if everything was okay or if an accountability buddy was n...</div>

I think there’s an argument to be made for keeping class sizes limited enough to make the coaching effective but this policy just seems like a cash grab. If I got charged $25 for being a minute late for something I’m already paying $200 a month for I can promise you it would only happen once.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Wait, you have to pay a $25 fee for a late sign up even if the class is not full? And you pay $25 if you are 1 minute late to class? Damn. 

Honestly this sounds like the gym is struggling and they want to be able to cancel class and not pay the coach if not enough people have signed up, by making it absolutely draconian for you to make your decision last minute. 

The fee for being 1 minute late is also absurd. No-show fees, even high ones, I get. Being late? Happens. We’re adults, here to work out. It’s not elementary school.

Unless this is the only box in a reasonable distance, I’d avoid it like the plague. Not only because they’ve forgotten that members are adults whose lives don’t revolve around the gym, but I’d be concerned about their longevity.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">No fee at our crossfit gym for late cancels/no shows.  Life happens and the owner realizes that.  I assume if there was someone stressing the system he would talk to them.  We might get an automatic email.  Most of the time no-shows are just people forgetting to sign in at class time.

Did I read that there is a fee if you reserve within one hour?  That's pretty bad.  If there is a spot, and you decide to go, you should be able to sign up at the time of class.</div>

Thoughts seem vague and poorly defined to most people. Part of learning mindfulness is to increase clarity (sati sampajañña in Pali).
