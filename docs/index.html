                        <div class="comment-body">Design the architecture and then let the LLMs perform the implementation. Not sure why this seems weird to people. LLMs can't mind meld with you to understand what you want and the details of it. When you YOLO prompt - you really don't care about the details because you didn't GIVE it any details. You're fine with it just working. In traditional development environments you DO care about the details.

That's not a waterfall thing or an agile thing... that's just a software development thing. Architecture matters. Standards matter. Tests matter. Performance matters. Code smells matter. MAINTAINABILITY MATTERS!!   
  
NONE of that matters to your YOLO prompt.

Therein is the difference. And yes, in all of the shops that I've worked with over the past year this is the way they are doing it. Even before Amazon's Kiro and Spec Driven Development (SDD), the shops that were successful at doing something other than a POC were designing up front and just using the LLM for implementation - within guardrails.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Okay bear in mind this might be controversial but FAANG engineers doesn't necessarily mean that they are any good. Most of programming is about exploration about the problem space. If you listen to actually good programmers like Carmack or Abrash you will see how much of their process is building small stuff and going in a particular direction and then tearing it down. So instead of this methodology (waterfall), which is a very old methodology and I would say pretty thoroughly proven to not be the best method. Try and do more exploratory programming and throw away the code because writing code is very cheap now because of the llms.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree with what you're saying in a lot of cases. The exploratory phase is where real world requirements become clear, design assumptions are tested and confirmed/rejected, solutions with a better fit are found etc. Front-loading in the way described above won't work well for small teams/individual devs in some cases especially when they're operating in a new or to them lesser known domain. The comical end of this spectrum is the vibesharts that think if they have enough characters in the plan.md file they'll be able to slither through the sewage that is their code to a viable MVP. 

But I can see how it would work in Google where every project they work on has multiple domain experts who have worked on similar problems thereby sidestepping a lot of the benefits of a looser, more exploratory approach. The proof is in the pudding as well, no? FAANG =/= the best engineers or coding practices but they do push it some of the most complex apps around and they do work well for the most part so this approach does seem to be working. I'd think they also have built in flexibility that will allow them to pivot if something clearly won't work.</div>

Engineers at bigger companies need to integrate with existing systems. Need to autoscale based on load? Use the existing platform. Need to build some frontend component? Use the design library. These design docs allow you to quickly leverage the codebase you're contributing to. LLMs should definitely help here too.

If you're building a greenfield project, use a different process. Focus on the hard parts first to better understand the problem space like you said. LLMs should also help here</div>

When to trigger it

                        <div class="comment-body">Employment is being attacked on all angles:

- Gig work is taking over
  - There are no labor protections, therefore it's cheaper and more attractive to employers
  - Operates on a global scale, driving down labor costs.
  - Combined with weak protections, this global market produces a race to the bottom.
  - The effect is suppressed wages in higher-cost economies, pressuring skilled workers to relocate or downgrade expectations.
- The push for remote work is turning employers to a global market, which in turn ties in with gig work
- AI is eroding the foundation of the workforce
  - Entry-level positions - the traditional stepping stones into careers - are disappearing.
  - Many employees secretly rely on "shadow AI", adopting unsanctioned tools for personal productivity, which helps them individually but undermines collective adoption and governance.
  - Rather than reducing workloads, AI enables managers to assign heavier workloads to fewer staff, cutting headcount.
  - Meanwhile, companies pour capital into experimental AI products, often duplicating effort and burning resources in the hope of replacing staff functions.

It is not looking good. Many people are being forced to risk it all in startups, which are being circled by the same venture capitalists that are encouraging the environment. Approximately 90% of all tech start ups fail. Soon these failures will start hitting investors. It will be interesting to see what happens.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's worse than that. 


According to Jerome Powell: we are in a "No Hire, Some Fire" economy. Meaning we're losing more jobs than we're creating. Each new jobs report is also dropping significantly from the last. Despite our current administrations attempt to Wizard of Oz the economy (pay no attention to the failings behind the curtain) data doesn't run on vibes. 


Jerome hopes that lowering interest rates will increase jobs which historically has worked. However it will increase inflation once again. He predicted that, *assuming nothing big happens* , the inflation rates won't surpass 2021 rates but likely won't go down until around 2028. He did state that the Federal Reserve will no longer try to get back to 2% inflation (the sweet spot) and will just attempt to keep it close. 


That is, however, assuming the tariff situation doesn't get worse, job markets improve and nothing catastrophic happens. 


Unfortunately, his job renewal happens in May of 2026, and it is almost assured he will get removed as Trump has been pressuring to install his own guy, in a historically non partisan governmental feature. Given the talent tree of our current administration, i am not confident we will get someone competent enough to steer our interest rates through these VERY turbulent times, but rather likely they will just do what Trump says, consequences be damned.

OK, it's only *inside* the cabin, and you can turn it completely off. No harm, no foul.

The ones that have a dedicated subsystem for this (VW) that you have to physically disable or spend money on software mods in order to kill them are a lot more asinine.</div>

Not sure how this new system would work since it’s integrated into the whole sound system.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">At least on the B8 S4 the Soundaktor just played a fundamental frequency to help you ear emphasize the good sound of the engine. It's a bit of a trick with your brain, I didn't actually mind it (I tried it on and off with my B8 S4). I found both interesting, and the brain trick doesn't actually sound synthetic. I listened to the Golf and I also prefer it with the Soundaktor off, I wonder what is different there. 

Later car makers really went overboard.</div>

I know some of you might think it’s a little silly to want a top-tier barbell when I’m not lifting super heavy, but I train 4x a week and would love to invest in something high quality that I can enjoy for years.

So, what’s considered the *Rol...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">OP, this is the right answer, and I'd like to explore the metaphor a little bit more. I was lucky enough to grow up... comfortable; I knew people who had Rolls-Royces. They weren't for daily use. That's the car for when you're at your Palm Beach House(TM). You daily an S class that's as long as a city block or a BMW 7 series if your weiner didn't work without viagra anymore. Reason being if daily wear and tear on those prestige vehicles is pricy? Wiper blades use to be $1500, and that was a decade and pandemic ago. Similar, you don't want to be kicking your fancy Eleiko bar while doing burpees; or having some clutz at the box drop it not know better. 

Point being, if you're going to do competition powerlifts, spring for the Eleiko. But first get yourself a Rogue bar to daily.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly I think Grok is an under rated competitor. All the times I've used it, it's been great. Not everyone just relies on hardcore coding as a job replacement. I'd say that's a minority -- yet, they are catching up surprisingly well in that space. I still think Google will ultimately win out, and I understand "Elon Bad", but that dude always seems to pull off the impossible... No matter what he gets into he somehow either makes it work, or completely defy expectations.

Again, I get the partisan political brain rot where we're all supposed to chant how much we hate Elon to signal to our tribe. But I'll die on this hill... This dude is rich as fuck, knows how to build amazing teams, and looks at things from a weird autistic way and manages to find unique routes to success. SpaceX and Tesla, were never supposed to succeed as far richer and talented people before him have created graveyards. Twitter was insisted to fall apart within a few weeks, then months, then year... And now it's worth more than he paid for it. Even smaller projects like Boring which people consider "failures" aren't failures at all... They aren't unicorns like he envisioned, but they are profitable, still progressing forward, super liked in LV, and still making breakthroughs to the point it may become a huge success, albeit, far behind schedule. 

His secret to success has always been being able to build great teams because he is also deeply familiar with whatever project he's working on. This builds trust and allows flat hierarchies. Everyone who's worked with him at a higher level all say the same, "I wanted to work with him because he's not like other CEO's. This guy actually deeply understands everything so I know we're on the same high level and can really communicate ideas... Rather than deal with CEO's who are just ignorant CEOs focusing on fundraising." Couple that with his money mountain, and I think he's going to really pull through. Every iteration has been great IMO, but within the community it's always been a joke, yet every generation gets more and more impressive with less and less Elon Bad critics chiming in. The recent Grok release is seriously insanely good and blows me away with its performance. 

My money is on he's going to look for more fundamental breakthroughs and will become a direct competitor with Google... My money is on having so much compute that the teams will have enormous flexibility to experiment and innovate with little constraint. OpenAI will be casual normie platform who slowly gets gutted out, and Anthropic will be more of a specialist that eventually gets acquired. Meta is the only unknown at this point. No fucking clue what they are going to pull off, and are basically a complete wild card.

The outlier here is Anthropic because they have a focus on interpretability research so in theory they could make a suprise breakthrough that catapults them ahead.

It's kind of bizarre that the general public even thinks that OpenAI is still in the race.</div>

Somewhere along the way, I got caught up in school, grades, and “serious” career paths. Years later, when I felt stuck, I went back to that same curiosity. 

I started building small projects again, and it reminded me who I actually am: someone happiest when I’m creating.

But after college and in my 30s, I realized that I wasn't reading much at all anymore. And the books that I started, I just couldn't get into and had trouble finishing.

So even though I felt silly, I went back to revisit old children's and YA books I'd loved when I was growing up. And it kick-started my love of reading again.</div>

Throughout my late teens and through college I didn’t read much. Maybe 1-4 books a year. Mainly easily digestible mystery books. 4 or 5 years ago I had the revelation that I was a reader as a child, and that must be important to who I am as a person. Should be noted that I have been trying to “find” my true self as I enter middle age. Ever since I have been reading nearly daily, trying to work through classics and my favored authors bibliographies .I have been enjoying my journey and plan to continue down the path of myself.</div>

When I realized as an adult (25ish) that I hadn't picked up a book in years after the Hunger Games trilogy finished, I went to a bookstore and grabbed a few of the "bestsellers" and attempted them. They were absolutely not my cup of tea.

Went to the library instead, back to the teen horror section that I loved in my youth, and breezed through the 10 books I checked out. I finish at least a book a week now, though it's generally an ebook on my phone.</div>

You're blanket defining pessimism as unconstructive pessimism, ignoring the fact that constructive pessimism is a crucial aspect of learning and progression as a human species. Expecting all possible outcomes is the foundation of intelligence, which requires both constructive optimism and constructive pessimism.

All you're doing is celebrating blind optimism and chastising blind pessimism, which is the exact same delusional behavior you're criticizing.</div>

That’s the opposite of my impression!  I think the scenario was quite clear about the ramifications.  Most of them are mentioned in the scenario itself (AGI could be close, racing with China is dangerous, etc.), but there’s also a summary in the “Scenario Takeaways” section [here.](https://ai-2027.com/summary)</div>

Ours Puny error prone human intelligence was able to accomplish it with narrow domain specific machine intelligence now the stakes are higher because we are actively creating superintelligence of more general types that can see evaluate infer apply patterns we wont be able to not in a million years, So doomer narratives prevail possibly foremostly from poor handling of previous narrow AIs, that is, social media that lead to massive damages to psychosocial aspects. Some of the lighter Doomer predicts are becoming true like AI psychosis and this is only the beginning.</div>

The situation isn't hopeless, there's still a real chance of a fantastic future relatively soon, but the risks are serious.

Stop trying to discredit those who understand the logical implications of this tech, just because you don't.

It's really not that hard to get a grasp on the fundamentals, have a read of any primer on AI.

This classic one is the easiest in my opinion:

Turned out there was no mortgage fraud and Cook had disclosed all information, so now Trump is going after the prosecutor and trying to get him fired so he can put someone else there go after Cook again.       

Conservatives for years cried about DOJ being political. Yet instead of making any effort to stand up against that, they are cheering for Trump to take it to the next level.       

Somehow Ben Shapiro, Candice Owens and Tucker Carlson are the only conservatives smart enough to realize this can easily backfire next time a democrat is in charge.</div>

Surprisingly at the sand time Trump fired the person in charge of enforcing the export controls of Nvidia's high end chips and the replacement Trump picked signed a deal granting the Emirates access to Nvidia's most cutting edge equipment for their AI center.

The Trump family must be so happy they were able to profit off Donald's political position. The US's geopolitical interests are now basically whatever is best for the Trumps' businesses

It allows to massively decrease the amount of compute needed for inference without sacrificing the model performance. It also allows for a much bigger context window since the price no longer scales quadratically but linearly!

**So basically:** everyone can implement this architecture without retraining. The price of models can be **Drastically** r...</div>

What really moves the needle is tying your work to dollars and impact. For example: Instead of “I’ve been here three years,” say “Since I took over inventory, shrink dropped by 18%, which saved us around $40K.” Instead of “I work really hard,” say “The project I led landed a cli...</div>

And then they have to pay 20% of my salary with them in recruiters fees, plus all the time cost of interviewing and onboarding 😂</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think the initial post is worded a bit strangely. After all, what you deserve depends on the value you bring to the table, and an important part of that is how much you make or save the place. They're not contradictions.

But I don't get what's supposed to be dystopian about this. It's a business transaction, you're selling your time and effort for money and it makes perfect sense that you argue for a raise based on the value you provide for the employer's investment.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean... To be fair... It's not possible to quantify work in any other way... You don't deserve more money because you worked at a place for three years, but you deserve more money because you worked at a place for three years and contributed to it's growth. That's what OP is trying to say too, it's the exact same thing but we should have the ability to phrase it better. I do agree that this is already a dystopian world, this example just ain't it though.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">thank you for sharing this, I think it's exactly what I need to read right now. not only to encourage me to going back to meditation but also because your experience showed me feeling liberated like this is possible.


when you said you were afraid of being alone with your thoughts I was like "OH so THAT'S why I'm terrified of meditating in this time of my life, who could have imagined" kkkkk


reading everything you felt afterwards made me genuinely happy, so thank you. hope you find true happiness in all of those experiences!</div>

From the Delectation of Independence:
"... whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness." 


Time for us to declare independence from the country of Israel.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Just want to share my thoughts about the Kirk shooting and how it relates to Israel -

 I am convinced that this was an MAGA/israel hit. 
We need to look back at 9/11. The project for a new American century said that a “Pearl Harbor event” needs to take place in order for their strategy to be implemented without resistance. 9/11 happens and we see the propaganda machine immediately start blaming bin Laden and Americans are emotionally manipulated into hating Muslims. It works and we are led into two bogus wars, the patriot act, extraordinary rendition ect.. 
What that has to do with this is - Project 2025. It was highly controversial. MAGA had 4 years to think of how they could enact their plan. So prior to Kirk getting shot, he denied Israeli funding so his platform wouldn’t be controlled by them to push their narrative to help fix their reputation. Kirk also said he wanted the Epstein files to be released, which would be a huge blow to Trump and Israel if they are implicated in the files. So they murder Kirk. IMMEDIATELY, social media exploded with bots and propaganda, the astroturfing has been insane. As if it were pre packaged and ready to go. All the funky stuff surrounding the shooting, and the shooter himself. The bogus text exchange, 2 decoy suspects, a suspicious private jet, the weird writings on the bullets, the trans roommate. Trump and Vance IMMEDIATELY place blame on the left before the shooter is even caught. And look at how trumps admin is exploiting his death… they quickly strike down on free speech, designate antifa as a domestic terrorist group (which anyone can be labeled as antifa) he already has the national guard in cities, he is pressuring the FCC so they will go thru with the merger, so the right can consolidate a state media program type thing. Netanyahu IMMEDIATELY says that Israel did not kill him. 
This is literally the 9/11 playbook. Instead of emotionally manipulating the American people to hate Muslims, they have manipulated us into hating eachother. And while we are busy fighting eachother, they are quietly pushing through more project 2025. Laura Loomer even took to Twitter to say there is an Al Qaeda terrorist threat in America. 
This is obviously high speculative, but it all feels so sinister and well orchestrated. I am sure I am missing more coincidences, so if I did, please chime in or fact check me.

Edit to add things that have happened since the shooting: 

Senate voted against releasing the Epstein files. 
Voted to revoke American passports for all who criticize Israel.
Closed a deal for TikTok to be sold to Larry Ellison, the biggest doner to the “ friends of the IDF”
Congress voted to allow weapon shipments to Israel without congressional approval.

Ben Shapiro instantly stands up and tries to force his way as the person who will carry Kirk’s legacy.

Am I crazy to think this all gives credence to the idea that this heavily implicates Israel and the Neo cons for 9/11?</div>

Our tax dollars are being used to fund genocide and to pay for their foreign healthcare and college programs while Americans struggle with medical and student loan debt.

Any criticism or accusation of war crimes is met with the claim of antisemitism. They are using religion as a shield to protect themselves from accountability and the law.</div>

We’re arguing left or right, meanwhile our tax dollars are bankrolling Israel without a peep. It is sickening, it’s a disgrace, both Dems and Republicans are happily in on it. One of the biggest travesties of our time. 

I can’t believe it sometimes, people are like “I can’t believe lazy people in the U.S. want affordable health-care!” meanwhile we are literally funding universal health-care for the Israelis 🤣 Regardless of partisan affiliation you have to agree that’s *fucked.*</div>

I haven't seen this posted here yet and thought it was really important. There's a new benchmark for AI software engineering agents called **SWE-Bench Pro**, and it looks like it's going to be the new standard. 

  
Top AI models that used to score 70%+ on the older benchmark are now only solving about 23% of these new  problems. Even less if they come from propietary/private repos. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Somehow stupid business types managed to convince competent researchers that benchmarks are the ultimate test of model ability.

"If you can't measure the thing you want, you have to want the thing you can measure."

IDK if this is due to the power imbalance between business leadership and researchers, or did the research community truly convince themselves that flawed benchmarks are worth pursuing anyway. But the end result was entirely predictable: frontier models getting overfit to whatever the most popular benchmark of the day is, without a proportional improvement in overall capabilities.</div>

This one was tough, mostly getting the editing right, but I hope you liked it!

I would, however, critique one thing that took me out: your sentries look way too "CG" for the conceit (without like, REALLY leaning into it and making them early CG abominations).  If you'd gotten them to have a more practical effects "Tokusatsu" or "Keita Amemiya" look, you'd have totally nailed the 80's, VHS core aesthetic.  Because you definitely did across the board otherwise (sound, plot, magnetic band distortion, etc.)</div>
