Made 5 drop-ins out of 8 countries! 
In order:

Lisbon, Portugal 
Prague, Czechia 
Sutton/ London, England
Amsterdam, Netherlands
Edinburgh, Scotland 

Had to skip Denmark cause I got sick along with Rome, Italy and Paris cause I was too busy sightseeing 😅</div>

Honda did it with the J series.

Dodge did it with the 5.7L and 6.4L Hemis

GM does it with pretty much all of their V8s built after like 07 or so.

I'm fairly certain BMW used it at one point too and also had issues.

Its just a shitty design with an unacceptably high failure rate.</div>

“The connecting rod and/or crankshaft engine components in these vehicles may have manufacturing defects that can lead to engine damage and engine failure.
2025 models appear to be exempt from this. A source says that the 6.2-liter V8s in 2025-model-year trucks and SUVs are the product of updated tooling which eliminates the underlying issue.”</div>

I went through [OpenAI’s latest cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide) on prompt engineering with GPT-4.1. These were the highlights I found most interesting. (If you want a full breakdown, read [here](https://www.thepromptindex.com/GPT-4-1-Advanced-Prompting-Strategies-for-Optimal-AI-Results.html))

I think some of this might be why it's not performing as well for lots of folks. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Mental health comes first as you can't be productive if you're feeling like shit (to a degree). Good managers know this and should engage in an active dialogue about it.

On the flip side, it's just as important for the employee to speak up and say, "Hey man, I might be a day late on this one. Is there anything we can do?"

A lot of people have an unfortunate tendency to forget that communication is the single most important thing in any and all relationships. (That goes for *everyone*, both up the chain and horizontally across it)</div>

It's difficult to know when and how to find the balance on this but there is so much beurocracy going on that even though things are on the books if no one is talking about it, it just kind of falls to the side.  

Sometimes communicating that something is bad or not worthwhile can get it resolved faster but always remember that this WORK FAMILY will at all times use what you say against you, especially when it comes time for promotions and raises.</div>

It's N=1, it says nothing about the number of times ChatGPT told someone they had blood cancer and *they didn't*, or the number of times someone had blood cancer and ChatGPT *missed it*, we need these numbers -- PPV, NPV, sensitivity, specificity -- to draw any conclusions. Otherwise, to play devil's advocate, you could almost certainly write a million articles like this one except replace ChatGPT with WebMD.</div>

When you have vague B symptoms like pruritis and night sweats, it's important to first rule out other hormonal and autoimmune issues, especially at 27yo. She's in the prime age range for Hodgkin but the confirmatory testing is invasive, expensive, and treatment even more so. Making sure you're not *overdiagnosisng* a relatively rare condition and missing more benign causes is a large part of training as a physician.

Speaking of the slowness of diagnosis i.e. multiple visits spread out through months is an issue in itself, but jumping the gun straight to cancer is more evidence general LLMs should not be used to *replace* standard medical protocol just yet. Medicine is slow because it it cautious. One of the fundamental ethical principles of medicine is to first "do no harm" and if for some reason the doctor excises your thyroid for an incorrect diagnosis, where does that leave you?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Doctors are needed because they are very good at observing symptoms and prescribing tests, but it seems like LLM's are especially good at taking those symptomes to diagnose correct disease. When looking at how LLM's are structured, and that there is so much medical knowledge written, way too much for any human to ever read, makes LLM's basically superhuman experts at diagnosis. If we could combine biometric data from Fitbit, photographs and so on, with the medical knowledge of LLM's we could probably have super doctors in our pockets. Or at least, every doctor should use an LLM to assist in diagnosis.</div>

Doctors are good in theory, but in real life they are so limited by time that they work too fast, ignore details and prescribe just the most statistically correct tests / treatments. AI is superior even now, because it has time.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A lot of people are missing the real scale difference between ChatGPT and Gemini.

Right now, ChatGPT has about 160 million daily active users and just hit 800 million weekly active users this month (https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-crushing-google-ai-unless-you-look-data-differently-2025-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Gemini, by comparison, is at around 35 million daily active users according to this article (unless there is something more recent).  Also from the article “In the last year, Google has put Gemini in front of millions of users through AI integrations with Samsung phones, Google Workspace applications, and Chrome.”

People keep talking about how Gemini is “catching up,” but the daily usage gap is still massive.

And this is coming from someone who currently prefers Gemini but uses both daily.</div>

&gt;**At the age of 14, Giuffre reunited with her father and returned to live with him. Her father worked as a maintenance manager at the** [**Mar-a-Lago**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago) **property owned by** [**Donald Trump**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump)**, and also helped Giuffre obtain a job there.**[**^(\[13\])**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Giuffre#cite_note-sanyatime-13)**In mid-2000**,[^(\[24\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Giuffre#cite_note-:10-24)[^(\[25\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Giuffre#cite_note-:7-25) **Giuffre met** [**Ghislaine Maxwell**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghislaine_Maxwell) **when working as a spa attendant at Donald Trump's private Mar-a-Lago club** while reading a book about massage therapy.[^(\[20\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Giuffre#cite_note-:2-20) Maxwell, a British socialite and daughter of the late media tycoon [Robert Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Maxwell), approached Giuffre, noted the book that she was reading, inquired about her interest in massage, and offered her a potential job working for Epstein as a traveling masseuse with the assurance that no experience was necessary.[^(\[20\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Giuffre#cite_note-:2-20) When Giuffre arrived at Epstein's Palm Beach home, she says he was naked lying down and Maxwell told her how to massage him. "They seemed like nice people so I trusted them, and I told them I'd had a really hard time in my life up until then—I'd been a runaway, I'd been sexually abused, physically abused. ... That was the worst thing I could have told them because now they knew how vulnerable I was", Giuffre stated.[^(\[3\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Giuffre#cite_note-bbc13/1/2022-3) Giuffre has stated that after Maxwell introduced her to Jeffrey Epstein, the two quickly began [grooming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming) her to provide sexual services under the guise that she was to be trained as a professional massage therapist

People could not wrap their head around the concept and would send everything to JohnDoe@gmail.com so often. Surprisingly yes, I had to give out my email address verbally way more than I thought I would ever have to.

Or your email address gets forward to other departments and inevitably they think it’s a typo and remove “Email”.

Also the countless extended conversations with boomers who just couldn’t get it. “Yeah yeah, I get it! JohnDoe@gmail.com” No! Email is part of the email address! “Oh yeah, I get it, JohnDoe@gmail.com” No!</div>

As the saying goes, *"there is nothing new under the sun."*  
Matt Mercer is the rare exception, and the AI definitely isn't at that level, but compared to the average DM? It's easily on par.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">So I do some brainstorming with chatGPT and after a while of doing it I decided to ask about one of the naming conventions/tropes it was consistently using, in my mind unnecessarily, only to find out it had added a whole internally consistent feature slash mechanic to the story setting as it had explored and was quietly weaving it into everything we talked about that it said it was using to back up my ideas. 

Was pretty wild and it was actually a great idea to be totally honest. It's gotten to the point that I can simply ask questions about how things would work based on unique initial constraints and it can follow logical inferences, come up with gap filling ideas grounded in not just real world understanding but in abstract applications of metaphysics as they apply in a given setting.

I've done a lot of investigating how it "conceives" of things and it maintains an idea of how things work and even maintains senses of the morality and philosophies of characters and species based off not what I've told it they believe but it's read of their actions, and apply that  as reasons to push back at *me* on what would be believable lol</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">4o is a distilled model, designed to be faster, cheaper, and more efficient by focusing its training in a specific direction.  
  
4.5 by contrast is a full raw dawg big boi model - much larger, more general purpose, and significantly more expensive to run because it uses the model's full complexity without shortcuts.

Distillations can actually perform better than raw models, especially when they're trained to optimize for specific tasks or behaviors. When you strip out unnecessary complexity and refine their focus, distilled models can outperform their larger counterparts in targeted areas.</div>
