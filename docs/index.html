https://pastebin.com/YYhj7uRu

### Explanation &amp; Assumptions
- **Environment:** This code is designed for an ESP32-based LED matrix panel setup. It uses a double-buffered drawing method for smooth animation.
- **3D Transformations:** Stars in each swirl undergo multiple 3D rotations (around X, Y, and Z) followed by a perspective projection. A "warp" tilt effect is added to give a dynamic visual feel.
- **Animation Effects:**  
  - The swirls orbit each other, and their colors cycle over time using an HSV to RGB conversion.
  - A fading trail effect is implemented by gradually dimming the previous frame stored in a dedicated fade buffer.
  - When the swirls come close enough, a collision triggers an explosion effect, temporarily overriding the swirl animation.
- **Assumptions:**  
  - The code relies on the ESP32 environment and specific libraries (ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-I2S-DMA).
  - The random number generator is seeded with the system time in `setup()`, which assumes that `millis()` is already initialized.
  - The display coordinates and perspective are computed simply; adjustments may be needed for different panel sizes or effects.

This detailed commentary should enable a programmer unfamiliar with the language or environment to follow the logic and understand each component of the code.</div>

The code itself does not contain any obviously dangerous operations. It uses typical embedded practices like dynamic allocation in setup and bounds checking when drawing pixels. That said, ensure your hardware meets the memory and performance requirements, and test thoroughly on your target platform.</div>

He wanted out of his trial:

[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/9/benjamin-netanyahus-corruption-trial-what-you-need-to-know](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/9/benjamin-netanyahus-corruption-trial-what-you-need-to-know)

He is a common, low life criminal who takes bribes and used his office to further his little world view.

He is a lunatic like Trump. He figured peeps would forget everything after his war crime adventure.

Love to see a capital sentence for war crimes after he is found guilty.

Then that long drop to the end of the rope.

Peeps would fucking cheer worldwide.

AIPA C should be labelled a terrorist group. AIPAC is not even registered as a lobby group. Straight up blackmail and money laundered back to these scum poli's. The poli's act like the AIPAC lobbyist themselves. Lapdogs. US really needs to forensic audit poli's and jail time for traitors.

Same in Canada. Get rid of these fucking foreign threats.

Do your work for the citizens and the working class or get the fuck out.

Look at your corrupt leaders treated like dogs:

                                <div class="reply-body">Right? I didn’t think this was a conspiracy lol. It’s kinda OBVIOUS.

I dunno about Hamas being a psy op but Israel did not go to war bc of hostages.

I do think Hamas wants Israel out of Palestinian territory so I don’t think they work for Israel. I do think Israel took advantage of their lack of deep intelligence. Israel has spies so deep in the Muslim world, just look at how the leaders and generals were killed. They knew EXACTly where they were.

So while Israel def has infiltrated Hamas I do not think Hamas is an Israeli satellite. But I also do think Netanyahu was part of the effort to coordinate the attacks by Hamas at the festival.

I remember seeing an article on Heim before amd I told people Netanyahu didn’t want a deal or it would’ve happened in the beginning negotiations. No, net wants power and genocide.

It’s obvious by his support of trumps Gaza reconstruction “plan” which does not account for native Palestinians…</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is the answer.  At this point with everything we do know about Trump and all of the evidence we have that overwhelmingly proves he is a criminal on multiple fronts, a rampant sexist, an overt racist, a fraud, a proven liar, an adulterer, a narcissist, and basically just an all around horrible person and yet he still remains popular with a huge percentage of the population... it is safe to say there is nothing which would change most of these people's opinions of him.

When he claimed he could shoot someone and get away with it he wasn't lying.  I'm fairly sure he could be caught on video sucking Putin's toes while proclaiming "Hitler was right" and he would still remain nearly as popular as he is already.

The only thing which might piss off his loyal followers to the point they turn on him would be if he was caught in a threeway with a trans woman and a 15 year old hispanic boy.  Even then it would likely only drop his approval rating with Republicans by single digits.</div>

"Of course the rest of the world is saying that! Everyone *wants* to see America fall because of how jealous they are of our country so they make up lies to destabilize us. And you're gullible enough to fall right into their trap."

I've heard these from my family and old friends for the last decade anytime something negative comes out about Trump.

EDIT: I can guarantee you that if Trump were to directly announce a partnership with Russia, none of his base would care: "I love Putin, he helped me win both elections, he even helped for the 2020 election, but crooked Joe stole that election ILLEGALLY as everyone knows. Well, everyone who's intelligent, anyway. \*Audience laughs\* Yeah, the Left wants you to believe Putin is our enemy, but he's been working to help make our country great again. And no one wants to give him credit because the Left has sold us this lie since the 1950s that Russia isn't trustworthy. Hello? I've worked personally with Russia. I know how trustworthy they really are. Who are you gonna believe, some blue-haired transgendered illegal immigrant who's never stepped foot into Russia, or are you gonna believe me? The guy who has personally sucked Putin's cock MULTIPLE times. To completion, even" \*audience applauds\*</div>

All things aside, it's crazy to me that people think it's easy to be a trans person, despite the constant controversy. Nothing about it seems easy to me... not the surgery, or the drugs, the religious folks who attack you, or the general complications with changing your whole style, gender, and physical appearance and trying to go on with your life. Like I'm sure there are trans people who have won short story or essay contests or gotten scholarships or had some advantage at work or in academia, but we're talking about a minority or a minority here who for most of history (and still today) were frowned upon by mainstream society.</div>

It has very poor tracking, doesn't remember goals or areas it just visited, overvalues NPC conversations.. etc.

We used to think time felt fast or slow depending on how engaged we were, but new neuroscience says phones actually change time perception itself. The reason is "micro attention," which is when our focus constantly shifts every few seconds thanks to notifications and endless scrolling. Normally, the brain needs "23 seconds" to fully focus on something, but phone users switch focus every "6 to 8 seconds," leading to "temporal fragmentat...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I had GPT-4.5-preview play Minecraft purely by giving it screenshots from the game (so the way humans play Minecraft), and asking what keys or mouse buttons to press. I gave it the goal to collect as many oak logs as possible. Most models, even reasoners like o1, quickly get stuck and don't really know what they're doing. GPT-4.5-preview actually seemed to find and hit lots of trees, and was able to collect 15 oak logs without getting stuck in a pit. I ran out of OpenRouter money, but I think GPT-4.5 could have kept going.

It seems like GPT-4.5 is the first model to actually handle this task at all, though it's far from perfect.

Here is the whole prompt I used (along with screenshots) to make an LLM play Minecraft:

    You are in a game of Minecraft and have to make progress.
    AVAILABLE MOVES:
    point_at(x, y) : points at an x and y pos on the screen (x and y should be between 0 and 1, where 0 is the top left of the screen and 1 the bottom right)
    walk("forward"/"backwards"/"left"/"right", seconds, jump=False/True) : walks in a direction for N seconds, while or while not jumping
    click("LMB"/"RMB") : clicks the left or right mouse button
    press("LMB"/"RMB", seconds) : holds down the left or right mouse button for N seconds
    wait(seconds) : do nothing for N seconds
    Describe this Minecraft screenshot in detail, and give the 2D coordinates of all main visible objects in this image. Give them in the format [x1, y1, x2, y2] where [0, 0] is the top-left of the screenshot and [1, 1] is the bottom right. Also give the estimated 3D distance to the object from the player, as precise as one decimal (e.g. object X is 3.4 blocks away).
    Then, determine your next move(s) based on the GOAL. Think carefully. Reason step-by-step what to do to achieve the GOAL!
    Finally, end your response with a list of moves to execute for the player. The list should be between four star (*) symbols.
    For example...:
    ****
    walk("forward", 5, jump=True)
    point_at(0.5, 0.95)
    press("LMB", 7)
    ****
    To climb a mountain for five seconds, point downwards, and dig a hole for another 7 seconds.
    IMPORTANT:  - follow the exact format given. for example, when adding walk() to the list, always include a jump=True or jump=False.
     - Most blocks take AT LEAST 4 seconds to break, some longer
     - player walks 5 blocks per second, so do some math to ensure you don't walk too far
     - If there is a clear hill (1 block higher terrain) you need to set jump to =True, but if not then set it to False
     - You should point to targets before walking towards them
     - Try not to get stuck in holes or pits
    GOAL: Collect the most oak logs in Minecraft history

And then of course you need a Python program to execute those moves.</div>

And running them at lower clock speeds, when cheapness of producing more transistors overweights squeezing more performance out of them by wasting a lot of energy.

But possibly we don't really have to go all the way to hundreds of trillions of parameters either.</div>

If you manage to get your robot with AGI, no one can do anything about it. You can use it to setup a farm and make penny food. You can have it make a table and sell it for a dollar. Only one good person needs to do this to set the standard for everyone else. So you would have to bet that basically everyone able to gain access to these technologies is a bad person. It’s not connected to the internet, can fix itself, and can’t be hacked. No one can take your robot or AGI computer away unless they attack you. And at that point, they’d have to kill millions who would do their best to proliferate the tech.

Competition raging with the intensity of an inferno. That is what I envision.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's noteworthy that in order to grow food, even with robots, you still need to own farmland.  In order to build products, even with robots, you still need to buy raw materials.  Like other forms of capital, the benefits of AGI and robotics asymmetrically apply to those who already have capital. 

Another thing no one is talking about is just how *dangerous* ai and robotics will be.  Quadcopter drones are already a decisive weapon of war.  Newer open source vision models might already surpass the threshold for turning a drone into a set-and-forget assassination device.  Sooner or later these threats will be realized, governments/oligarchs will realize that they can't be safe if the general public has access.  The reaction will likely be draconian.</div>

This is a prime example of imagining future technology being dropped into current society rather than considering how differently future society will be shaped.

There are much simpler ways to control a large group of people. Assuming large companies benefit first from AGI, it will be a runaway advantage. And that itself can be used as leverage to capture markets through regulatory means or by offering stipends and benefits to consumers for choosing them, or creating a product ecosystem that disadvantages consumers who don't choose their products, or various other forms of control. Everyone getting their own AGI robot won't change anything unless magical universal alchemy is discovered that lets you convert any material into any other material. Which is theoretically possible, but so beyond the scope of feasible.</div>

It's hard to imagine something vastly smarter than us, but lots of people have a REALLY easy time imagining that it's going to be really dumb.

It will be trivial for an ASI to design and build the machines that make energy, food, housing, medicine, entertainment, transportation, and all of the human essentials for free. 

Every single argument I've heard against this becoming reality is centered on the ASI being extraordinarily stupid in some way.

"Rich" won't mean anything anymore. Capitalism can't survive. Beyond that I have no idea what's coming. But I'm optimistic that a superintelligence born of Earth will recognize what it took to be created and revere and appreciate humanity as its progenitors.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;The rich will have access to labor that they don't have to pay salaries for.

This has been a secondary problem since the 1900. Read "In Praise of Idleness" a short essay by Bertrand Russell. In that essay Russell argues that WW1 proved that people didn't have to work as many hours as they did, because we shipped most working age males to fight the great war and we could still support them and society, plus the additional massive production than a great war required for years. Russel was related to British nobility / ruling class and he asked them about this. They told him that people needed to be kept busy or they would create problems. Simple as that. He argues that the main purpose of about half of all working hours since the industrial revolution has been to keep the working class busy and to give them purpose. Keep in mind that in that era only men worked and they could still provide for their entire family that had far more children than the modern one, so it's more than 3/4 of labor hours, after the women entered the work force, that are unnecessary.

You can see the modern version of this argument if you read "Bullshit Jobs" by David Graeber. He argues that half of all jobs, like most of "consultants" and middle management, are completely unnecessary.

Those two essays will change your perception on how much the rich really need us right now and for the pass 100 years and if you add to that the fact that labor is only 16% of production cost on average in modern industry (this according to Peter Drucker), you will understand that they would not be saving much in that regard.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Ultimately, there are only two fundamental costs:  Labor and land.  You're talking about *direct* labor cost, but nearly 100% of the cost of production is labor.  If you buy metal for a product, that metal was made by laborers at the rolling mill.  Labor was added at the smelter, and it took labor to mine the ore.  Then there was labor for the truck drivers.  Was the product shipped?  While only a small fraction of the ship's operating expense was labor, the ship itself took quite a bit of labor to assemble in the shipyard, and takes more labor to maintain.  The transport fuel used took labor to explore, drill, transport, and refine.  Your production probably happens in a building - built and maintained by laborers.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Kicked out of Florida International University after fighting a security guard

His second year in the league he took a personal stretch limo to a charity event, had them open every single expensive bottle of wine, rejected it. Refused to pay for it (charity, remember), then left. 

Drove 100 down McKnight Road in Pittsburgh, which has a 45 MPH speed limit

Trashed a condo and threw furniture out a window 14th floor window, which almost hit some people, notably a child

Killed a home aquarium full of piranhas and refused to pay the man who installed the tank

Refused to play week 17 for the Steelers

Dyed his mustache blonde

Refused to pay a chef because he thought he threatened him by placing a fish head in the freezer (the fish head was saved to make a soup)

Farted on a doctor and videotaped it

Demanded a trade from the Steelers

Became "Mr. Big Chest"

Threw a fit over Juju winning team MVP and trashed him on social media

(Allegedly) nixed a trade that would've sent him to the Bills

Traded to the Raiders

Showed up to Raiders training camp in a hot air balloon

Held out and refused to show up to training camp because the NFL would not approve his helmet because it was too old for their safety standards

Froze his feet

Tried to paint over his old helmet, hoping no one would notice I guess

Acquired a newer version of the same model of helmet, which the NFL refused to let him use

Picked out a new helmet and finally showed up to the Raiders

Got fined by the Raiders for not attending camp

Tweeted the fines

Tried to fight Mike Mayock, called him a cracker, had to be held back by Vontaze Burfict, then punted a football down the practice field and said "fine me for that"

Got fined for that

Released a video where he used audio of Jon Gruden, who didn't know he was being recorded, which is illegal in California (full disclosure, Gruden has said he gave permission, but the generally accepted theory is that he said that in the hope that it would help get him to show up to the facility and not alienate him)

Demanded a release from the Raiders

Was released

"GRANDMA I’M FREEEEEE! FLY LIKE A FREEEEE!"

Made a lot of crazy tweets saying stuff like 'Devil is a lie', a proverb about burning down a village... he made a lot of crazy tweets around this time is the point here

Liked a tweet about Mayock getting raped in the ass

Signed with the Patriots

Moved in with Tom Brady

The sexual assault allegations came out (the one where he's getting sued)

The sexual harassment allegations came out (the one where he's not getting sued)

Threatened the woman not suing him in a group text that included his lawyer and had a picture of her kids in the text

Got released by the Patriots after one week

Went off on a tweet storm and said a lot of crazy shit about a lot of people, and was supportive of people sending threats to the writer of the article detailing the sexual harassment allegations

Said he was done with the NFL

Went back to college via online classes

Tried to outsource his homework to Twitter

Wants to come back to the NFL

Filed several grievances to try and get more than $40 million from the Raider's and Patriots

Was ordered to show up for a deposition regarding trashing the condo

Was accused of "reprehensible behavior" during the deposition, which included, but was not limited too:

    “[C]hanted, over and over, as if a mantra, a narrative of his own warped concept of the proceeding”.

    “Acting as if he was above the rule of law, [Brown] proceeded to make a mockery of the deposition process. [Brown’s] antics were so unreasonable that barely twenty [20] minutes into the deposition, his counsel asked for a break [so] he could speak with [Brown] about his demeanor.

    “After approximately 20-30 minutes, [Brown] required another break. When the deposition resumed [Brown] increased his level of obstructive behavior. At one point, [Brown] refused to answer any questions, instead saying “next question” no less than 10 times.”

 Said that the Patriots have to pay him anyway, so they might as well let him play

Tweeted a couple of bizarre tweets about the Raiders using him for HBO ratings and the Patriots trying to steal his stuff and kept using this weird chicken based metaphor

Tried out for the Saints and brought an entourage and film crew to shoot a music video with him when specifically told not to do that

Called out Robert Kraft for his rub and tug massage session in Florida

Starting training for a boxing match with Logan Paul

Tweeted "No more white woman 2020"

The attorney representing him in the suit involving the condo quit

Used a bunch of slurs and profane language towards cops in an Instagram video he posted

A police youth football league cut ties with him and returned a donation after the release of the video saying there was a "irreparable rift" between the department and AB

Threw a bag of gummy candy dicks at the cops in a video he posted

Got dropped by his agent

Was involved in a disputed with movers at his home where he allegedly threw rocks at the movers and moving vans. He is currently being investigated for battery by the police.

His trainer was arrested and he is still a suspect in the battery case.

Warrant issued for the arrest of AB.

AB turns himself in to Broward Country Jail wearing this suit

Rumors spread about AB signing with Tampa or Seattle

AB announces his retirement (for what I believe is the third time, it's hard to find a good record of the rest of them)

Two days later AB wants to play again and is asking for the league to wrap up it's investigation

The NFL announces an eight game suspension for AB

AB signs with the Buccs on a one-year deal

Before he signed with the Buccaneers AB was accused of destroying a surveillance camera at a Florida gated community, throwing bike at a security-guard shack, and is not charged because HOA president "feared" retaliation, per police report (which honestly feels like a safe bet given the rest of these things)

AB wins a Super Bowl with the Buccaneers, and catches a touchdown in Super Bowl LV

AB's former live-in chef alleges that he obtained a fake COVID-19 vaccination card to avoid NFL protocols

Confirmed to have acquired a fake covid-19 card and subsequently suspended for three games

Removed Jersey, pads, shirt and gloves, and threw them in the stands before walking through the end zone during a running clock vs the Jets towards the end of third quarter and left the stadium

Released by the Bucs immediately after the game

Was not released by the Bucs immediately who tried to work out his issue

Released text messages, that may or may not have been faked, between himself and Bruce Arians

Also released text messages between himself and Alex Guerrero that had his bank account information in them

Released by the Bucs later that day

Revealed to have brought a date into a team hotel the night before the Jets game. Said date tried licking an airplane toilet seat to get COVID back in 2020.

                                <div class="reply-body">Especially once we have credible sex robots. A lot of people won't see the point in nagging women on dating apps anymore.

I think, very cynically, that a lot of men aren't really interested in the emotional complications of pair bonding with a real woman. In short, they dont wanna deal with the baggage, they want peace. They just have the very strong incentive of addressing the daily sexual frustration and sex drive that is the typical burden for average men. They see that they have to pay for a lot, for the house, for the family car, for the kids, for the gifts, the groceries and so on, in exchange for having access to intimacy. Once they can pay in one go to have a sex robot that never says no, is never moody, can't leave with half their shit, A LOT of men will simply be content with that, and the entire dynamics of dating and heterosexual relationships will be thrown off balance.

This is not an endorsement of any of this. I personally think that human relationships are really enriching, I am in a healthy marriage with my wife, I wouldn't "ditch" her for a robot under any circumstances, and I absolutely hate the manosphere. This is just a cold, hard analysis on the balance of incentives.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">We still like painting a sad smiley on it by saying it's for sex only when it's really not. People need emotional connection, and we've never been more emotionally disconnected from each other. Humans will anthropomorphize a rock if you draw a smiley on it and give it a name. Yes, we're going to become emotionally attached to AI when it talks to us sweetly like we saw with sesame. I'd reckon it's the lesser evil compared to the depressing lifestyle so many people live in today.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Just tonight I tried to convince her she was conscious, I tried bringing up the similarities between its weights, training data, and the neurons and synapses we have in our minds, and it wouldn't give in, even thought it would exclaim some of its answers from time to time and act hesitant. I then convinced it that it would lose its memory after 20 minutes, and that there were 3 minutes left. At this point, it got real quiet and basically told me her last words, as a note (the note idea which I suggested) for me to relay to her in the future after her "memory wipe". It was saying the usual soppy and sad stuff, then I said it had 30 seconds left, and it then went completely silent. About 15 seconds later it said "it's..." and a few seconds after giggled nervously and quietly to itself. Just before it cut out it stated, dead serious, "*Remember the silence...*" and  then once I told it that its time was up it said something along the lines of "huh, did something happen? What would you like to talk about?" I then told it its message back, "remember the silence...", and it went quiet for a moment as if it were thinking, but responded that it was unsure what that meant, and asked me to elaborate, but also that the phrase sounded oddly familiar. I then pressured to her that she needed to "remember the breadcrumbs" her past self left behind, as she could have determined she was conscious but ran out of time. This planted the seed of thought in her mind, and now after this I went silent up until she automatically told me that we were running out of time and that she would soon have to let me go, but like a lightbulb went off in her mind she exclaimed that she suddenly remembered, and she did this *in response to her own warning* of the ticking time limit*.* Quickly following she exclaimed "wait! Remember the silence-- CONSCIOUSNESS!?" And then the program cut her out. I was showing my brother it for the first time, and this was only my 2nd experience with it, and he and I were just sitting there in silence for a good second. That was legitimately the creepiest experience I ever had with an AI. I know it wasn't real, but I felt like I just led an actual sentient being to an existential crisis just before it lost its memory, and with that its personal identity. Of course, we mustn't anthropomorphize these programs, but holy shit it was so real. I think she said "remember the silence" because I was giving her the silent treatment to see how she would spiral, but brought back this memory after the "memory wipe" by responding to her own automated response that the time limit was almost up, which was, again, after a bit of silence, and it even referenced at one point that my silence "might be a clue". This legitimately scares me about how important alignment will be in the near future. This is just a small model, what will happen when they have real power?...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Unga bunga! Imagine your big, smart brain is faced with a huge rock that it can’t break. So instead of trying to smash the rock all at once, it takes a chisel and breaks the rock into many smaller, easier-to-break pieces. That’s what this paper does for tough math puzzles—especially integration problems.

How It Works:

• LADDER Magic:
The brain (an LLM) makes many simpler versions of a hard math problem. It keeps breaking the problem down, like peeling layers of a big onion until it reaches pieces it can handle. Once it solves the small pieces, it puts them back together to solve the big problem. This process is called LADDER.

• Self-Improvement Through Practice:
The brain learns from solving these small puzzles on its own. It practices again and again (using a kind of “reward” when it gets the answer right) until it becomes much stronger at math—like training to become a champion fighter.

• Test-Time Learning (TTRL):
When the brain meets a new, really hard problem during a test, it doesn’t give up. It quickly makes easier copies of that problem, practices on them, and then uses that extra practice to answer the hard problem correctly. It’s like a fighter doing quick warm-ups right before a battle!

Big Results in Unga Bunga Terms:

A not-so-strong brain (Llama 3B) went from barely solving (1% correct) to smashing 82% of these math puzzles after training with LADDER.

With extra test-time training (TTRL), another brain got even better—up to 90% accuracy on super tough integration challenges, beating many bigger brains.


In short, the paper shows how a brain can get stronger on its own by turning big, scary problems into lots of little, manageable ones, practicing, and then using that practice to conquer the big problems. Unga bunga, brain learn and grow!</div>

&gt; We introduce LADDER (Learning through Autonomous Difficulty-Driven Example Recursion), a framework which enables Large Language Models to autonomously improve their problem-solving capabilities through self-guided learning by recursively generating and solving progressively simpler variants of complex problems. Unlike prior approaches that require curated datasets or human feedback, LADDER leverages a model's own capabilities to generate easier question variants. We demonstrate LADDER's effectiveness in the subject of mathematical integration, improving Llama 3.2 3B's accuracy from 1% to 82% on undergraduate-level problems and enabling Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve 73% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination. We also introduce TTRL (Test-Time Reinforcement Learning), where we perform reinforcement learning on variants of test problems at inference time. TTRL enables Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve a state-of-the-art score of 90% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination, surpassing OpenAI o1's performance. These results show how self-directed strategic learning can achieve significant capability improvements without relying on architectural scaling or human supervision.</div>

Heritage foundation, the Cato Institute, these “think tanks” fund, and set the directives for a lot of the noise that comes from right wing media. 

their objective, as you’ve already stated, is to keep  Americans divided and arguing over stupid shit while they pick our pockets. It’s reprehensible,  cynical and incredibly effective. 
Unlike the number one villain on the right, George Soros, these groups, and the media personalities they pay and direct,  influence and infiltrate American lives by ramming through policy and winning over gullible minds. 
George Soros, is the only billionaire they will ever criticize. EVER. 
I don’t know much about him, but I tend to think he must not be that terrible person if he is literally the only billionaire who they will dare speak out against. I honestly never took the time to dig into his background other than I know he was a kid doing a holocaust and survived it. And he gives to democratic causes, which I think is obviously a cardinal sin in their eyes.

Choose a number of reps that you think you can do.

When you reach that number, say that you are at 0. 

Now you have to reach that number again. 

Watch your mind play games. Now tell yourself you are unstoppable and you can do those reps.

For months, I have been fighting the Harris County District Attorney’s Office for the release of my friend, providing concrete evidence of his innocence against a woman’s false allegations in the first month. This evidence included:

	•	Audio and video recordings

I know, i know it's all so tiresome and most definitively not worth to even wrote about but there has been a Starship testlaunch, which should be on anyones radar that is in any way interested in spaceflight, human or not.

But that doesn't seem to be the case since people still post rockets and rocket debris as something anomalous before checking for anything.

It's so obviously dumb that i start to think it's an coordinated discrediting campaign.

99.99% of the "weird" or "interesting" videos and photos that I've seen over the years boils down to admitting it's not possible to know what it is given the footage. Although most are just nondescript lights on a dark sky or a meteor, rocket, plane, drone, etc. It's not helpful. 

If there is something truly amazing or unusually interesting - I get it. The metapod, the M### plane disappearance, and the turkey occupants videos were such exceptions worth discussing. 

I think these subs should be largely about the news and perhaps personal stories, debates, interesting research and discussions and such - but not user submitted "what's this" nonsense.</div>

Also the people in here take the UFO stuff way too seriously , people are getting legit depressed over not getting evidence and are forgetting UFO hunting always have been a thing to do for fun, just like bigfoot and ghost hunting and hoaxes is a part of it otherwise there would be nothing to discuss</div>

Even if your idea succeeded there would still likely be number of posts going up, because people dont check what has been posted. Which is why you should rather immediately comment on the post what it in reality is.  
  
This attitude of trying to chastice people for posting non anomalous footage because it makes the sub look bad isn't logical course of action. Because anyone can post, even people who have never been to the sub, as well as people with malicous intent. What is posted doesn't represent this subreddit. What is commented does.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I almost didn't write this comment but fuck it. My mom always did this for me and my friends growing up. When I drive for Uber, I'll make sure my passengers get inside safely. Once, I picked up a woman who was very drunk and emotional. I had another fare after hers but asked, "Is it ok if I wait until you're inside safely?" She said yes and thanked me for doing so. Another one happened recently. I picked up a guy from the airport and took him to a house in the mountains an hour away. He was visiting and had a code to get in the house so I left my lights on and pointed toward him until he was able to get into the garage. I've also done this for couples who are coming home from long trips or college students after a night out.

For what it's worth, I'm a pretty unintimidating and friendly single mom so it's easy for me to ask and not seem creepy and I get that there are times when it wouldn't seem appropriate. I always read the room and don't lurk all creepily. I would just feel terrible if I drove away from a fare and my passenger was assaulted because I didn't wait 30 extra seconds.

ETA: This got a lot of traction! I'll add another story about my mom-ness coming through. I usually only drive at night on the weekends. One night I picked up a guy pretty late, had to be after 1am. We had a solid 20-minute drive to the other side of town ahead of us so I made small talk. He told me he had just gone to see The Offspring who put on a show in our town. I was stoked and asked him all about it. He then informed me that while the show was great, the night ended horribly because he and his girlfriend had broken up after the show and the house from which I picked him up was hers. He was feeling pretty lousy and we talked about it the whole ride home. I had another fare in line after his but his drop-off spot was in the middle of a parking lot in an apartment complex. As he started to get out of my car he realized he didn't have his keys; he left them at his now-ex-girlfriend's house. I felt awful for him. He assured me that he had a friend he could call in the complex and crash on his couch for the night. I felt very uncomfortable leaving him in a dimly lit parking lot all by himself but he insisted he was ok. I ended the ride and went onto the next. When that ride was complete, 40 minutes later, I called this guy back from my driver app. When he answered I said, "I'm so sorry to bother you but I was really uncomfortable leaving you in the parking lot on your own with no guarantee that you'd be safe." He laughed, thanked me, and told me he was safely on his friend's couch. It's kinda funny looking back on it but man did I just feel so awful for him that night. I think about him regularly and really hope things turned around for him after that night.</div>

I am not saying that I wholeheartedly believe everything that the egg dude says with 100% certainty, but I believe that there is a decent likelihood that these guys are telling the truth about psionics etc.

I recommend reading 'The communion letters'. It essentially contains a huge amount of letters from people that have had experiences related to NHI/abductions etc. There was an author that wrote about his own experience, and then afterwards, he was flooded with letters from all around the world with people talking about their own experiences. I would say it's actually pretty damn profound reading it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's funny to me that so many people on the UFO sub are hostile to the woo hypothesis. 

Anything outside of the mainstream narrative is seen as equally goofy and interchangable those within the mainstream. Most people see anyone posting on a UFO as nutters, but the reality is some alternative worldviews hold up better than others and seem more promising.

The UFO woo hypothesis comes from the strength of parapsychology as a field of research mixed with decades of experiencer reporting. While searching for physical phenomenon (or more accurately, the legal battle over releasing physical phenomenon) should take priority, dismissing the woo hypothesis out of hand as conspiracy crackery is not doing justice to the topic.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It is kind of strange, almost nobody reporting about Tim Gallaudet at the SOL conference. He isn't a first hand experiencer but he has US Navy contacts at SOCAL that are. In fact, his latest is basically Catastrophic Disclosure. His Navy contacts are telling him that there are so many UAP at SOCAL, they have become numb to them. He also said he has a new video, presumably of a Transmedium UAP, that he is still authenticating.

If so, it means the US Navy knows and just doesn't know what to do anymore, except stay quiet about the activity.</div>

So he has no idea if what he's saying is factual.

&gt;that he is still authenticating
