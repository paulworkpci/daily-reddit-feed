Here's an extract from the article:

&gt;**GreWi:** Back to VaMEx-MarsSymphony: The University of Würzburg's share in the planned VaMEx project also includes a UAP camera. So it would be the first time that we would search for unidentified flying objects and phenomena (UFOs/UAPs) on another planet. How did you come up with the idea of doing this on Mars?

&gt;***Kayal:*** *We still don't know what UFOs and UAPs are. Mars and Earth are very similar in many ways, from geology to meteorology. If UAPs exist on Earth, they could also be seen in the Martian sky. Another advantage of such a detection would be that we on Mars could at least exclude known terrestrial triggers from many classic UFO/UAP sightings such as birds, insects, balloons and airplanes, etc. as explanations for possibly detected UAP from the outset. The number of terrestrial satellites and probes on or around Mars is also still manageable and their flight and orbits are known, predictable and easy to verify. However, we are not looking for small green men on Mars, but for anomalies that could indicate new events or properties. The chance of this happening is small, but such a detection on Mars would be a sensation and would provide us with data that often stand in the way of elucidating these phenomena with terrestrial systems.*

&gt;**GreWi:** So the camera is not looking for green Martian men. But what if you do discover them?

&gt;***Kayal:*** *Mars and Earth are similar, but we know that Mars has been developing for many millions of years from a once presumably life-friendly world to an environment that is now hostile to life, at least on the surface. Higher life, which still exists today, is almost impossible here and there are no known traces of an advanced civilization so far. Life on Mars, if it ever arose, is likely to exist only in the form of microbes. In fact, however, one goal of the entire VaMEx mission is also the targeted search for life on Mars. So we don't want to rule anything out. We are happy to be surprised by what this presumed Martian life will look like and whether it is actually "green".*

&gt;**GreWi:** The funding of the project with federal funds is also unique so far (funding number 50RK2451A) and seems to me to be a big step for serious research into UAP in Germany.

&gt;***Kayal:*** *Absolutely. It is the first time ever that a research project with a very specific UAP component identified as such has been funded by the federal government. We are very grateful for that. In 2022, UAP research was explicitly included in IFEX's research canon. This funding is also a recognition of our efforts to reduce the stigmatization and tabooing of this field of research at the academic level. We hope that this will open the door to further UAP projects funded with significant funds and perhaps also lead to cooperation with relevant state institutions.*

Germany has always been quite withdrawn on the UAP subject from an external perspective and now they are just 'yeah, we chucking on a camera to look for UAPs on Mars and we got funding for it in 2022, no big deal,'.


That's pretty great! No nonsense, taking it seriously, using valuable payload space...this is pretty big news.</div>

Idk if we're relevant enough for NHI to even approach us on a societal/ political level the way some claim it happened in the US.

we also don't have a powerful independent intelligence apperatus that persists through different administrations in government.

If half the stuff that has been claimed about this topic is true I have no idea how it would work or interact with our society. Do they just brief our new government normies every 4 years about crazy shit that may be  going on ?

Do our intelligence agencies fax around information about NHI ?

I wouldn't put it past us to be completely in the dark in case that the US government is actually hiding a bunch of groundbreaking information.</div>

I thought mars has no atmosphere, such that it is not like Earth’s “sky.” Wouldn’t the camera observe lots of meteors - “rocks” transferring from space to Mars’ surface without all of the friction that happens here? And wouldn’t that be just as confusing as birds and balloons?

People said the same shit about the industrial revolution, "4 Hours Work only 4 Days a week!"

We know the exact fucking opposite happened.

With all that being said, if an Ai becomes sentient and self-directed, the realm of possibility expands exponentially... But to think Ai created by google or musk or whatever power hungry individual/organization is going to uplift humanity... Well they are probably the same stooges that bought trump's golden sneakers and shill coins.</div>

We do have the other nefarious products yet to deal with like pollution and such, but life is better as a result overall.  Oh and there's billionaires now.

I think AI will be much the same, standard of living will go up. The downside, nefarious product, will be a loss of individuality and privacy.  Oh and there will be trillionaires.

I try to leave supportive and helpful comments but if I go in to a thread and it’s already chock full of venom, I usually just keep my mouth shut to avoid getting yelled at by somebody who’s already mad and is now extra mad that I’m not mad with them.

Btw, are you THE Pervocracy? Like, the blogger? If so, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart! When I was 16-18, your blog shaped my expectations and beliefs about consent and everything related to it. And that’s really good news because I was one of those catastrophically precocious girls who got surrounded by evil skeletons, like, four seconds after I stepped into high school. Thank you! My life would’ve been a lot worse for a lot longer if it weren’t for you!

Hi, 31f here with an insane amount of chaos in my life. 

I work full time as a mental health therapist, I have adhd and autism, I have 3 kids who are all neurodivergent, a spouse that’s neurodivergent and I care for my elderly parents (mom has Alzheimer’s). All of this to say I am just as fuck. 

So after work, I give my kids quick meals and then head over to my parents house to help them out. 

I get home late then eat pizza or take out or any other trash food, put the kids to bed and then cr...</div>

You are not failing, you are navigating an impossible situation with everything you have, and that is extraordinary.

I know it feels like there’s no space left for you in your own life, but you matter. Your health, your well-being, your peace, all of it matters just as much as everyone else’s. And you don’t have to fix everything overnight. Start small. Swap one meal for something a little more nourishing. Move your body in a way that feels doable, even for five minutes. Let something go, one thing, even if it’s just the guilt for not being able to do it all.

You were never meant to carry all of this alone. If there’s any way to ask for help, even in the smallest way, take it. If there’s any way to be kinder to yourself, choose it. You deserve that. You deserve rest, care, and a life that gives back to you, too.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Here is some information that may put things in context.

In 1994, the Soviet Union had fallen, leaving nuclear weapons in the hands of fragile, corrupt and possibly hostile successor states.  3,200 warheads were left behind in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus, many atop ICBMs that could launch and hit anywhere in the world.

There was not much concern about the ones in K-stan or Belarus as neither country had the technical know-how to maintain or launch them.  Treaties with Russia quickly drew those nukes back within Russian territorial boundaries.

Ukraine was a very different story.  Ukraine was a technological and manufacturing powerhouse from the former USSR and had both manufactured most of those nukes and missiles, but also was the primary source of trained personnel to maintain them and build new ones.  In fact, Russia actually had to conclude a later treaty with Ukraine to provide skilled labor to maintain those nukes that Russia had.  But that is another story.

Knowing Ukraine had the know-how and capability to posess nukes, but also knowing Ukraine, at the time was hopelessly corrupt and did not want to spend money on those nukes, the US, UK, Russia and Ukraine entered into nuclear non-proliferation talks with the goal of de-nuclearizing Ukraine.  Those talks succeeded, and became UN Treaty Registration Number 52241, colloquially known as the Budapest Memorandum.

In agreement to return the nukes to Russia, Russia, the US and Great Britain gavce vague security assurances which boiled down to two concrete treaty responsibilities.  First, none of the signatories would invade Ukraine (ha!) and in the event of invasion, the signatories would be required to meet and determine a course of action to support Ukraine's sovereignty.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Fast forward, and in the mid  2010's Russia both invaded Ukraine, starting an eleven year period of hostility and violence, mostly through proxies but exploding to the full scale war we know today.  UK and US met, as per the our treaty obligations and determined to support Ukraine through arms, training and humanitarian aid.  In addition to our treaty responsibilities, the US, under Joe Biden, also convinced many of our European allies to support Ukraine in a similar manner.  This was due to intelligence that indicated Russia was planning additional quick invasions, with Moldava scheduled to be invaded the first week of March, 2022. 

It was a lot easier to perform our responsibilities because a popular movement in Ukraine had existed for years combatting corruption, leading up to the creation of an immensely popular Ukrainian TV show, Servant of the People, where a high school teacher became president and cleaned up the corrupt government.  This series so resonated with the reform minded psyche of the Ukrainian people that the star of that show, Volodymry Zelenskyy, an accomplished actor, was drafted into politics and in a stunning upset, actually elected President on a reform platform very similar to what his TV character championed.  Certainly an example of life following art.  

But it boiled down to the fact that a pro-democracy, anti-corruption government in Ukraine made performing our treaty obligations an easier pill to swallow.

In 2025, the US had repudiated our treaty obligations and are refusing to continue to support Ukraine, as agreed in our required meet and confer.

Now, this is a good deal of history and we approach our real point.  

Ukraine is, to date, the only country in the world that has given up nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees.  It is also the only country in the world to be invaded by one of those guaranteeors, and also the only country in the world to have another one of those guaranteeors refuse to abide by their treay responsibilities.

Other countries are watching this, and weighing the value of developing nukes and retaining them, vs the value of negotiating away their nuclear armament.  And they overwhelmingly see that giving up nukes results in existential threats to their sovereignty and existence as a culture, and that the most powerful countries in the world are either doing the invasion, or standing by while it happens.

The conclusion is that if Ukrain falls, there will be significant increased nuclear proliferation as a result.  No one will, ever again give up so much as a single nuke.  And if nukes proliferate, they will eventually be used.

This boils down to one idea:  If we do not support Ukraine, eventually millions of people, possibly people you know and love, will die in nuclear fire.

But we can prevent that, right now, by demanding US leaders abide by agreement 52241.

                                <div class="reply-body">This is a good write-up. I just want to add one thing as an aside. Which is that we in the West see Russia as somehow 'more real' than Ukraine. This isn't really our fault - we were understandably focused on the USSR and the Cold War.

But Russia strongly pushes this propoganda - that Ukraine isn't 'real,' that they're the same thing, etc. This is exactly meant to legitimize themselves and to discredit Ukraine. Funny enough, Russia - as an idea - is a newer invention than Ukraine. When the USSR fell, Yeltsin tried to move Russia in a more democratic direction. When Putin took over, he reinvented Russia by glorifying the USSR, taking control of the media, getting rid of political opposition, centralizing his power, etc. The 'idea of Russia' has never really settled. 

But Ukrainian history doesn't start with the Budapest Memorandum. It's a very important context, and people should understand it. I'm just afraid it feels esoteric - like saying, 'we should help because of this one thing.' Ukraines' actual history is long, interesting, and tragic; and it is not even slightly new that the USSR / Russia has been trying to erase it. So if 'we should help because we agreed to' isn't enough, I do recommend people learn some of this history.</div>

After his controversial post yesterday where he called Zelensky a dictator, you had comments in the conservative sub saying “I’m struggling to see the 4D chess aspect of this, maybe there’s something we don’t know yet?”

It’d be hilarious, if it wasn’t so sad.</div>

We can do both

He's correct on the structure of current education. Since the industrial revolution, it's been about effectively turning children/people into machine operators and system workers for production. Now that automation will increasingly fill those roles, the way forward is through instilling *how to learn* and to be able to quickly adapt to change. To be creative.</div>

E.g. drone surveillance l, digital surveillance, wire tapping etc. I think they're using intelligence in the espionage/surveillance sense rather than the biological sense. Especially given the next sentence is "or impair the effectiveness of an intelligence **method** currently in use" methods aren't biologically intelligent in any sense so the only context in which that sentence makes sense is if intelligence is being used in that following sentence in the espionage/surveillance sense.</div>

I think there's a definite possibility that they are referring to nonhuman collection methods (i.e. SIGINT, GEOINT, etc) and not "NHI". I'm sure if this report was written today and they wanted to convey that, they would not use the term nonhuman. I feel like NHI wasn't really that common of a term in 2012.</div>

Instead of dreams or any of the FORD items, instead talk about the shared setting you are both currently in. Yes, that means the weather. But it can also mean "What do you think of the atmosphere in here?" These types of discussions are great for building a shared experience.</div>

Of course weekly active Users is different from the original User number. And there does seem an uptick in User numbers and social acceptance.

Once you have started using chatgpt or Claude or deepseek, you get used to its style. And chatgpt have done rather good job in being product facing too.

                                <div class="reply-body">One of the concerns is how much users are actually recurring users. How much just drop in once a month for a request vs are daily users. I think their DAU is far from 5% of the world population. 

If their churn rate is over 50% (which I think some people have noted), it is also a concern. For reference Netflix is sub 10%. The true question is whether they do have a moat - they are top of mind for most people but as we saw with DeepSeek topping the download charts a few weeks ago it may not be guaranteed forever.</div>

No, this does not appear to be a 'cleaning of house' -- this is a magic trick.

Anyone thinking that just one of the parties has dirty laundry is naïve to say the least. And this has nothing to do with current politics, this been happening for decades so unless this person selectively exposes a few things here and there to come down on one side of the political spectrum, nothing will come from this.</div>

You will never hear about how Allen Dulles was the head of the CIA while his brother John Foster Dulles was the Secretary of State. Or how their grandfather was Secretary of State John Dulles. Or how his brother in law was Secretary of State Robert Lansing.

How many American families can boast of having THREE men who became Secretary of State?

The Deep State is responsible for a century of American imperialism in Latin America.</div>
