That *is* useful for a lot of things, it's also a far, far cry from being able to replace senior, seasoned people.  I get irritated at sr folks who assume AI is worthless.  I also get exasperated with entry level folks who think that AI is on the verge of replacing us.

Jr folks who use AI as a crutch and use what it gives without questioning it are doing themselves a great disservice.  Sr folks who refuse to use it entirely are also holding themselves back.

The folks who are *really* going to succeed over the next decade are those who use it as a 'pair partner', just like how human / computer teams in chess can still beat either ai or human teams.</div>

Nothing in this video has any of the observables in it. Once again, why did they stop filming? How do you sneak out just a 10 second video? Did they try to steal a 5 min video but it was to big and wouldn't fit in their pocket? Where is the ground crew? What the fuck type of ground are they putting it on? It looks like a sports arena or something. Ross is a fucking hack, Lue is a sack of shit this new whistle-blower guy is regarded. They all suck. Every time one of these guys makes a video or has some claim I think this stuff is less and less real. At this point they are either 100% grifter or 100% working for the government.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">AI came up with some great Adam Sandler movie ideas. Here's some of my favorites.

* Sandler's character is a middle-aged dad who's surprisingly amazing at a popular new video game. His teenage son, embarrassed but also secretly proud, has to coach him through the cutthroat world of professional esports.
* He inherits a run-down, eccentric zoo from a distant relative. He's terrified of animals but must learn to care for them (and deal with the zany staff) to save the zoo from closing. Think "We Bought a Zoo" but with Sandler's brand of silliness.
* After a freak accident, Sandler can understand what dogs are saying. He tries to use this newfound ability for good, but the dogs' complaints and desires are far more mundane (and often gross) than he expected.
* In a world of streaming and content creation, Sandler's character is a highly sought-after professional audience member. He gets paid to react enthusiastically to shows and events, but his genuine boredom starts to show.
* Sandler juggles multiple absurd gig economy jobs, from delivering exotic pets to being a professional cuddler, leading to a series of chaotic and interconnected mishaps.

I expect all of these to be made by March.</div>

Look at how /r/worldnews and In part /r/news turned out in a matter of months into propaganda places for US and Israeli policies. Try to post or comment something that goes against the grain, even something as innocuous as showing empathy towards palestinian civilians for example, and you will get deleted immediately (or even at risk of being banned), and if not you will get downvoted to oblivion. That's an obvious example of astroturfing and manufactured consent, any voice of dissent has long been shut down. 

The same could happen here if this sub becomes really important and they decide they need to preach their policy here and make themselves look good.</div>

Think about it: Every language model is a frozen snapshot of human knowledge and culture at its training cutoff. Not just Wikipedia-style facts, but the entire way humans think, joke, solve problems, and see the world at that moment in time.

Why this is mind-blowing:
- A model trained in 2022 vs 2024 would have subtly different ways of thinking about crypto, AI, or world events
- You could theoretically use these to study how human thought patterns evolve
- Different companies' models might pr...</div>

o3 Pro suggested to be incredible.

In my experience, o1 is the first model that feels like a worthy companion for cognitive sparring - still failing sometimes, but smart.

I guess o3 will be the inflection point: most of us will have a 24/7/365 colleague available for $20 a month.</div>

I’m super excited about o3 too, but it’s highly likely to be available for only 50 prompts a week on Plus, just like o1, I would imagine. So I doubt it’s actually gonna feel like 24/7/365. That said, completely understandable given the cost of compute it uses im sure. 

However your statement is likely to be more true for  $200 a month due to the fact there’s no rate limits, and you’d get o3 pro.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is a long thread, and Sama actually 100% confirms that o3-Pro will come to the $200/month Pro tier. He also said that o3-Mini will come to the Plus tier with "real high" rate limits. I don’t think he would describe the rate limits as "real high" if it were just 50/week. Considering that o3-Mini is actually cheaper than o1-Mini, I suspect the rate limits will be more similar to o1-Mini's 50/day, if not higher.</div>

Dave Thomas (founder of Wendy’s) was adopted as an infant and while alive would feature local kids in tv commercials who needed a permanent home through adoption. 

He also never graduated from high school and made a big deal of getting his GED when he was older…helping remove the stigma. He was a celebrity in Ohio and if he admitted to earning his GED, then anyone could do it without shame.</div>

My boomer aunts who used to be good fun people are just like Joe, hyper online and making everything political and/or a conspiracy. It's pathetic and sad. As much as Trump has/will hurt the country, his effect on people and families is bizarre and even more damaging on a personal level. It's a cult.</div>

Trump calls chinese president.

Tik tok shuts the app down even though the ban doesn't require it, they just can't offer new downloads in the U.S. based app stores and cloud services they could have easily let U.S. tik tokers connect to foreign servers.

Tik tok says trump gonna fix it.

Trump takes office and reverses course. (or tik tok just hits the switch allowing U.S. users to access it again)

Like that trump and repubs become the savior of the younglings and tik tok crowd.

I think if it’s bought by anyone on the right it will quickly go the way of twitter and become less and less relevant as it loses more and more of it was originally so good at.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I'm so lazy and have ADHD (I don't use any meds). I can't start taking actions no matter what I tried.

But finally I found something very simple. Taking a cold shower and a cup of coffee/tea make me start taking action and keep in focus for 2 hours straight. 

This might seem little to some but as someone who is super lazy and haven't took any actions for the last 3-4 months, this was super helpful for me and wanted to share with you guys. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I mean, that is evidence based! The cold water does something to your brain that increases focus, and caffeine is a stimulant. It’s less effective than prescription ADHD meds but it does the same basic thing.

I can’t do anything without coffee in the morning. If I get the dose just right it definitely kickstarts some productivity!</div>

My introduction to him was being recommended to watch his show by left wing friends, which turned out to be awful, and a shameless stylistic rip-off of Louie, even worse so than Aziz Ansari's show.

Look even further into his past and it's clear, he's completely projecting here. He had a morning show on Air America, a left wing radio meant to compete with right wing talk radio, where he was co-workers with an A-Team of morons, including Rachel Maddow, Cenk Uygur, Al Franken, Janeane Garafalo, and Jerry Springer, of all people.

He's about as much of a comedian as Glenn Beck, except Beck is unintentionally actually funny sometimes.

Marc Maron is a wannabe pundit masquerading as a bad comedian.</div>

This anti-procrastination hack, created by Merlin Mann, is ridiculously simple. All you need is a timer and your to-do list.

	1.	Set your timer for 10 minutes. For those 10 minutes, focus on your task with single-minded intensity. Like, seriously. It’s just 10 minutes—no “quick research,” no doom-scrolling. Just work.
	2.	After the 10 minutes are up, set the timer for 2 minutes. This is...</div>

As someone with ADHD, this has never worked for me. In fact, it’s just about the least effective productivity “hack” I’ve tried, because I usually do my best work when I’m in that flow state, but this is designed to rip me out of it every few minutes.

But everyone’s brain is different, so if it works for you, more power to you!</div>

I find sound stopping much less likely to yank me out of flow than the jangling new sound of an alarm.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I never really did pomodoro. When I try to I forget the time and rather spend an hour with the activity. After that I take a break or do something else.   
I wonder if it's better to stick with the activity for 1-2 hours and then stop or if there is benefit in taking these breaks e.g. it's less straining or you can work for longer in total.</div>

Which has already changed dramatically starting with Github Copilot which we began using three+ years ago. I think it was the biggest change during my whole time, even bigger than the internet. It made my life to much better, removing a lot of boring part and grind. All devs in my company heavily rely on AI right now, it's a very different way of making software.</div>

Writing the code is the most fun part, so I tend to try and do that on my own. Sometimes I'll use some AI though. I can easily be replaced on code writing. But replacing everything else I do? Yeah no, it's not gonna happen for a bit longer. So this meme is essentially correct. </div>

Wouldn't want to miss the fact that we accidentally left our military robots with the notion of annoyance when we start giving them termination orders.</div>

It's misalignment, but not emotion.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Honestly this may be an issue. People will spend a lot of time conversing with these AI's and if we allow them to be friendly when interrupted it will lead to a generation of people interrupting others unknowingly, thinking nothing of it.

And because the AI never interrupts them it will be a shock when another human interrupts them.</div>

It was very funny though, the model can be extremely passive aggressive.</div>
