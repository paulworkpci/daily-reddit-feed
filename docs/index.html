Try not to close more than half the vents.

                        <div class="comment-body">First off, I think this is really common! I found when I was at school my brain was wired to ‘get tasks done’. Ticking things off a to do list is satisfying, and helps you feel like your day has structure and purpose. The inverse of this is an open, unstructured day where you’re free to do what you like. In theory, this should be a joy! Look at all this free time I have! But I get the tendency to ‘optimize’ your free time and make the most of it. My rec to you would be to start your day by going on a long walk, and setting a timer and dumping everything that’s on your mind into a list on your phone/onto paper. That way you can see all the tasks, anxieties etc that might be surfacing when you’re trying to enjoy your free time. Once you’ve done that, you can review your list and mentally (or you can write) how/when you plan to tackle or resolve each item. For me, that gives me the mental space to feel at peace to take a day to rest, without feeling like I ‘should’ be doing something else. From there, I would be kind to yourself and give yourself a few ‘goals’, but stay flexible. Only get 1/3 things done, no worries! You can try again on your next day off. Let yourself rest!

I don't have a phone addiction, but I do find it easy to lay around. So one day is devoted entirely to my work, which is pretty demanding. The next day I use for me, but still productive. Gym, meditation, reading, etc.

I think the big goal for days off is to make sure they are treated like you are looking out for yourself. Don't drink yourself numb, fall into vices or use crutches to make an unsatisfying life bearable.

Put time into things that will pay you back, and don't play the "will I won't I" game in your head; regardless of your choice it will make you feel like a loser.

Hope this helps some, know it's not the most practical advice.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree with the general sentiment but AlphaStar was not superhuman, it was \~1000 MMR below the top player on the ladder and would not have been able to beat the best SC2 teams or win the world tournament.

AlphaStar did reach top 0.1% SC2 performance, but never got to the very top or beyond. The original showmatches were unfortunately tainted with impossibly fast/precise unit control and seeing the whole map at once, once reasonable speed/reaction-limits were put in place, AlphaStar reached pro level, but below the best players.

And unlike in Go, there was no new discoveries about the game from AlphaStar, it did some things differently, but it was generally objectively worse. AlphaStar, also, unlike in chess and go, needed a lot of human game and supervision to keep it from ending up in loops, they did AFIK never figure out how to make it improve itself without human examples like AlphaZero.

Though I have no doubt that it would be possible for Deepmind to eventually get to superhuman performance in SC2 if they had kept pouring resources into it, but after some millions of dollars in research/compute they got in the top 200 on the ladder and moved on to more pressing matters.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Woken up in the middle of the night by banging on the front door. Security camera showed a man kicking at the door and carrying a axe which he would occasionally swing at the door/handle. We called the police and they were in route. With 911 on the phone (on speaker) I got my shot gun and yelled to the man that he needed to leave and that we were armed. Partner stayed with the kids in their bedroom. I shouted several times that he needed to leave and that I would shoot him. He kept kicking the door. He finally broke the door enough to get through. I leveled the gun and shouted again and he came at me and I fired. 00 Buck shot in the upper chest. I kicked the axe away and kept the gun pointed at him. The police arrived less than 30 seconds after and I put the shot gun down with my hands up. The police officer took my shot gun, handcuffed and rendered aid to the man but he was already dead. I’m assuming they (the police) still have to try. The police took a statement and I emailed the video (front porch and inside) to the detective. 

A few days later we got a call from the police that the family of the man wanted to talk to me and the detective said he thought I should. They were very kind and apologized for their son’s actions. They offered to pay for the door he kicked in and any other damage to the house. The father was very quiet but had a kind expression. The mother did most the talking and explained that their son had gotten involved in drugs and they “lost him” year ago. They both apologized many times and offered to help. I explained that our home owners insurance was covering the door (it was an antique mahogany door with stained glass) and damage to the house. 

We sold the house shortly after (kids and us were not comfortable living there after) and moved across town. Every year since we have gotten a Christmas card from the parents.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Actually, watching military plane flight patterns is a weird little hobby of mine and over the past week I was seeing a frankly absurd number of P8 Poseidons (advanced submarine hunters) flying over land/mountains for whatever reason. There's also been a somewhat unusual number of signals intelligence and electronic warfare planes out and about, including one instance where two Constant Phoenix were up at once - those are planes specifically designed to detect radioisotopes in the atmosphere. Usually don't see more than one up at any one time.

Also had a couple days where two B52s were doing odd little patterns at ~25k ft, which seemed low for them. Could have been a training exercise, but B52s [can also potentially be used for advanced signals jamming.](https://theaviationist.com/2024/07/12/upgraded-alq-172-tested/)

Lastly I've seen the new [Compass Call](https://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/ec-37b-compass-call/) up several times this week, which I found interesting as I haven't seen those on public ADS-B before. Probably test/training flights. One of them did high altitude racetracks at the Washington/Canada border for like half an entire day.

There have also been many, many tankers. More than usual.

A lot of this could be explained by pilots needing to get their required hours/landings/training done before leaving for the holidays. So it's not proof of anything. But it is fun to follow.

[This is my FR24 filter list for US/Canada military](https://freeimage.host/i/2OnmB71) if anyone wants it. I like to swap between FR24 and ADS-B Exchange since some planes will show up on one but not the other.

(Also I have screengrabs of most of these interesting flights, just don't really feel like uploading a whole mess of random flight tracker screens for no reason.)</div>

They proved they can track and stop unknown drones. 

Yet, in over a month they've done nothing about this and plainly lie to us. 

They rubbed it in our face by publicizing and bragging how quickly they caught those two.

But we still have no answers?!</div>

I've long held the stance that it's not even buzzwords, or a lack of, being the issue.  It's knowing somebody within the company that gets your application streamlined to the interview process.  Doesn't have to be a higher up, it can be anyone already working for the company, but a higher up will streamline three process even more.  I've applied to hundreds of places where I would be a great pick, did extremely well on the rare interviews I had, only to never get a call back or get an email saying they decided to go with somebody else.  I don't know anybody in my preferred field.  All my friends do something else.  A friend that works in automotive told me to apply for his company and put him down as a reference.  They wanted experience, and I had none in that field.  I applied anyway and started orientation 2 weeks later.  Maybe a month ago, some of the guys and I were standing around talking when it was slow, and one of the guys was talking about how he was dissatisfied with the company and thinking about getting another job, but said it's so hard finding work nowadays.  I mentioned my "need someone on the inside to get the job" theory, and that's when all but one of the 10 or so people that were standing around talking said that they think they only got the job we had now because they knew someone already working there.</div>

TFWs.

They could hire their cousin without the ad.

But, they can't justify hiring temporary foreign workers (TFWs) without one. Companies have to show that they've "attempted to" hire locally before they can bring on the *much more affordable* TFWs.</div>

What if AI does give a proof to a conjecture? They gonna verify it? If it is one of Millennium problems, and AI outputs &gt;40 pages proof, it will take a while.

Plus, did they double check whether process output by O3 in this test are entirely rigorous and correct?

And yeah, the set you described can be made.</div>

The lowest difficulty is called "Medium" and as far as I understand, these questions should be solvable for any graduated mathematician.

Anyway, since o3 solved 5 - 25%, it's likely that these were some of the easiest questions in the set. They are probably proofing the benchmark for the future, when there will be AIs solving the toughest questions in that set.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">From chatgpt: Project 2025, developed by the Heritage Foundation as a policy blueprint for a potential future conservative administration, does not advocate for universal basic income (UBI). Instead, it proposes significant reductions in federal social welfare programs and emphasizes work requirements for assistance. For example, the plan suggests tightening work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and changing eligibility criteria for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), potentially reducing access to these benefits. Additionally, Project 2025 calls for the elimination of programs like Head Start, which provides early childhood education for low-income families. 

These proposals align with actions taken by some Republican-led states that have banned the use of public funds for basic income programs lacking work requirements. For instance, Iowa recently became the fourth Republican-led state to prohibit such spending. 

In summary, Project 2025 does not support UBI; rather, it focuses on reducing federal assistance programs and enforcing work-related conditions for aid.</div>

I realised this issue so I checked reddit for answers. One of them was to put the phone in another room. Now I have tried this and it didn't work 2 years ago but this time I put the phone where the reward was. For example after I finish a coursera I could go play drums or after I exercise I eat. I just wanted to share this because I'm fascinated how effective it is.</div>

Unlike other apps that completely block access, we draw on Cognitive Behavioral Theory (CBT) to help you recognize your screen time habits through regular prompts and inculcate healthier behaviours without restrictions. It's an independent app that's easy to set up, intentionally has limited features, and offers a lifetime plan too.

                        <div class="comment-body">Non trivial economic value if successfully applied and deployed. Applied and deployed are the key words. I have no doubt AI will be ridiculous, but I agree with Sam Altman; ~’AGI will come and no one will really care’~. 

Even if LLMs plateaued today there would be years of integrations, and applied deployments/ configurations.

Do I think AI will be so good we can accelerate that part? Yes absosultely, but I’m not expecting b general public to see the economic hit on mass for another 2 years</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My belief is that Copilot is going to surprise workplaces. It's called "Copilot" now but I feel like all these side by side tools are going to eventually get agent features and then you come into work one day and your Copilot already got half your work done.

That sounds like sci-fi, but right now Copilot is around GPT3.5 in terms of capability and OpenAI is already announcing o3. Companies have generally wanted to avoid the reasoning chatbots, for a number of reasons; but when agent capabilities come out they'll likely be using some of these reasoning capabilities and it'll be unavoidable that they're useful.

So I imagine the wide-spread acceptance of Copilot is going to be the backdoor that AI takes to weasel it's way into the workplace faster than people expect. Everyone accepts the AI tool into their workplace and then upgrades eventually push it to start usurping jobs.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">People should remember that such was said about almost every single piece of modern tech ever:

**Rail travel (1825):** “The gross exaggerations of the powers of the locomotive steam-engine…may delude for a time, but must end in the mortification of those concerned.”  
—*Quarterly Review*

**The telephone (1878):** “The Americans have need of the telephone, but we do not. We have plenty of messenger boys.”  
—William Henry Preece, Chief Engineer of the British Post Office

**Light bulbs (1879):** “Everyone acquainted with the subject will recognize \[Thomas Edison’s experiments\] as a conspicuous failure, trumpeted as a wonderful success.”  
—Henry Morton, President of the Stevens Institute of Technology

**AC electricity (1889):** “Fooling around with alternating current is just a waste of time. Nobody will use it, ever.”  
—Thomas Edison

**The automobile (1899):** “The ordinary horseless carriage is, at present, a luxury for the wealthy; and although its price will probably fall in the future, it will never, of course, come into as common use as the bicycle.”  
—*Literary Digest*

**Planes (1911):** “Airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value.”  
—Marshal Ferdinand Foch, Supreme Commander of the Allied Armies in World War I, 1918–20

**Sound in films (1928):** “I don’t think people will want talking pictures long…. Talking doesn’t belong in pictures.”  
—Joseph M. Schenck, President of United Artists

**Television (1946):** “Television won’t be able to hold on to any market it captures after the first six months. People will soon get tired of staring at a plywood box every night.”  
—Darryl F. Zanuck, Head of 20th Century Fox

**Home computers (1977):** “There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.”  
—Ken Olsen, Founder of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)

**Laptop computers (1985):** “For the most part, the portable computer is a dream machine for the few…the real future of the laptop computer will remain in the specialized niche markets.”  
—*New York Times*

**The internet (1998):** “By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”  
—Paul Krugman, Winner of the 2008 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences

**The iPhone (2006):** “Everyone’s always asking me when Apple will come out with a cell phone. My answer is, ‘Probably never.’”  
—David Pogue, Technology Editor of the *New York Times*

So, being "smart" is not really a preclusion for being wrong or failing to adequately predict how an emerging disruption could alter the landscape.

Also "smart" is a shallow method to judge people.

Steven Pinker has illustrated himself to hold very stupid opinions. He's to humanities what Gary Marcus is to AI.

That guy larped as a "smartie mac smart" for years, using shoddy sources like white supremacists blogs (Steven Sailer) and the like.

When you think of Pinker, Marcus, Peterson, one might think there's something going on with a portion of psychologists in the english speaking world... All these people have in common of talking BS way beyond their field of expertise.

That's why i hate the idolization of particular individuals and the cults of personality which are born from it.</div>

Submission statement

Looks like some of the coast guardsmen who claimed their boat was followed by a fleet of mystery drones are starting to speak out after the White House accused them of misidentifying commercial airliners flying into JFK international airport.

“It’s the implication that’s insulting,” said the Coast Guard member, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “It’s implying we’re making sh-t up, when the ones making up sh-t are down in Washington, D.C.”

Looks like some of the coast guardsmen who claimed their boat was followed by a fleet of mystery drones are starting to speak out after the White House accused them of misidentifying commercial airliners flying into JFK international airport.

“It’s the implication that’s insulting,” said the Coast Guard member, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “It’s implying we’re making sh-t up, when the ones making up sh-t are down in Washington, D.C.

We were actually out there to see if we could spot any drones, because of all these sightings. Well, we found some drones. Or more accurately, they found us .

I’m terrible with measurements, but [the swarm] was about 80 to 100 feet above us. They had four propellers. Seven feet across. The flashing lights, like you’ve seen. The festive green, red, and white lights, around 20 knots, which is just over 20 miles an hour. 

Commercial airplanes don’t move like that. I’ve been out there when planes were coming in for landings in New York, and trust me, you can tell the difference. We’re not idiots, we know what drones look and sound like.

 I can’t pretend to know what’s going on, because I don’t, but they weren’t the types of drones you can buy at the store. These were government drones. If [the drone swarm] fired at us or engaged us in any way, we would’ve fired back.”
