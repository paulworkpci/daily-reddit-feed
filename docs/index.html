I was part of the Green Day fandom from 2018 to 2023. I know that many people in this subreddit were/are active on social media, and experienced a band and/or celebrity through that lens. I was the same way until I left social media in 2024 due to negative experiences in the fandom and personal mental health struggles. I don’t see myself returning, and looking back, there’s some advice I wish I had taken sooner.

Now I just listen to their music when I want and don't worry about following every little thing they do online. Made me enjoy the band more tbh.

We didn’t have Green Day message boards, but I would buy tons of magazines, plaster my walls by every cassette and CD and tape everything that was playing on Much Music (canadas mtv when mtv actually played music videos). It was actually my earliest memories of experiencing Limerence and obsession , and it was same for Nirvana and Kurt.

                                <div class="reply-body">yeah this happened to me yesterday with gemini.

my wfie's passport expired 7 months ago, and she wanted to be sure she could use the simplified renewal process to renew it, rather than having to re-apply for a new one with guarantors etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Unfortunately, **you can't use the simplified passport renewa**l process if your passport expired 7 months ago.

Here's why:

* **Eligibility:** **The simplified renewal process is generally for passports that expired less than 5 years ago. Since yours expired 7 months ago, you fall within this timeframe.**
* **Application:** You'll need to complete the **Adult General Passport Application (PPTC 153)** instead of the simplified renewal form.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think in reality it’s going to come in phases and each phase will probably last longer than most on this sub would say. Most people on here don’t work in tech I presume as it shows. 

I agree with the sentiment that fully remote is most at risk, especially in companies with an actual office space. Most of them miss out on a lot of collaboration opportunities because they don’t even hear about them. Unless they are proactive about it people often don’t know much about them outside of the work they produce. 

Humans are emotional creatures and so there’s the simple fact that managers will be biased towards people they see in the office too. I foresee a lot of blended roles happening. Speaking of managers it’s become less common to *only* be a manager. 
Maybe you’re a dev who also is personable (yes they exist) and can take on some marketing responsibilities. Perhaps you’re a QA who’s technically very capable and can start taking on dev tasks as the QA workload decreases etc.

I think this is where the next phase will happen after the initial wave of employees is let go, is a lot of blended roles and that could last a while. 

Until humans produces 0 value that can’t be replicated for cheaper there will be a benefit to having more employees of higher quality than your competitors. If 1 person produces the value of 100 10 years ago then 2 is still double.</div>

That’s what I thought about this too. The US has used the guise of terrorism to cause terror all over the world. 

Which creates extremism in those countries. Then that creates actual “terrorists” 

Personally I’m not even sure we can call them terrorists anymore. 

Imagine growing up in a small town, you walk to the market and just as you get on your street a drone you can’t see or hear drops a bomb on your families home- you see them die. 

That guy isn’t exactly a nasty terrorist for wanting revenge on our country. And the only way to hit a country like ours when you’re poor is to engage in dirty warfare.

Edit: remember if we need to use our second amendment we will be labeled as terrorists until we win</div>

https://x.com/arcprize/status/1890464924075282549

&gt;Inspired by @karpathy's recent tweet - games are a great test environment for AI

&gt;They require:
&gt;• Real-time decisions
&gt;• Multiple objectives
&gt;• Spatial reasoning
&gt;• Dynamic environments

&gt;So we built SnakeBench to explore how LLMs would do

Damn o3-mini and R1 are MUCH better than everyone else, impressed by how many apples o3-mini got. Really excited to see more benchs like this, i assume labs are building tons of benchs like this internally to then train their models with RL against them.

And thats vanilla o3-mini, not even high! https://x.com/GregKamradt/status/1890468362284683656

They used o1-pro to generate the game engine, it one-shotted it https://arcprize.org/blog/snakebench

&gt;o1-pro one shot

&gt;The initial snake game was produced by o1-pro in one shot. It effectively aced the environment's logic during tests, requiring minimal re-prompting of the game engine.

&gt;The prompt used:

&gt;Can you make me a snake game I can play?

&gt;but instead of an automatic timer it is turn based?

&gt;With an arbitrary amount of players, so multiple snakes.

&gt;Each snake will submit a turn they want to do, and then a "round" will happen.

&gt;Make a function that will ask each "player" what move they would like to make.
Multiple LLMs decide where they want to go. I want to make LLMs battle in snake.

&gt;Make the grid size arbitrary too.
I also need a way to replay the game, so make sure to store history state.</div>

I'm from the UK and most people my generation are screen addicted unfortunately, I'm not too sure how it is in other countries.

                        <div class="comment-body">Im 25 so a bit older gen Z. Fortunately people around my age are not THAT into internet culture. Some are and having conversations with them is impossible, its all internet jokes and reference that i dont get (been off most socials since 2019). But im still glad i got a bunch of friends who would perk up on mentions of hiking or sports, tho most of us are busy in our newly acquired jobs so we rarely meet.

I think it helps that we did experience some part of our childhood without the internet. I remember getting on facebook and youtube when i was 11 but it was still a rare thing and it was actually social media back then unlike now. So when it all became a mess and algorithm driven it was noticeable (at least to me). I think it all comes down to that are people around you aware of what social media is doing to them?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not said enough. The government generally receives more tax revenue from the spending of social welfare recipients than from corporate income taxes. Corporate tax revenue in 2023 was $425-475 billion. Corporate taxes typically make up only about 7-10% of total federal tax revenue. Total social welfare spending in the U.S. is $3-4 trillion annually. A significant portion is recycled into the economy, generating sales, excise, payroll, and income tax revenues. While it's difficult to produce an exact number, estimates suggest that tax revenue from the economic activity of social welfare recipients spending welfare dollars surpasses corporate income tax revenue in many cases.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Fox News has been propagandizing people for decades now. I’ve watched its effects on my parents over the past thirty or so years and it’s almost depressing to see how far from their true values their political beliefs are. They’re loving, caring people who would go home to get food to give to some hungry person they passed on the street, but when it comes to politics they buy into conservative media 100%. It’s finally getting to the point where they’re going to have to confront the cognitive dissonance.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/TommyShelbyPFB:

That quote about NHI is right below the title, from **Prof. Michael Bohlander (*****Chair in global law and SETI policy, Durham Law School*****, UK)**

Is everyone noticing a huge change in coverage from the mainstream lately? They are openly connecting UFOs to NHI and ET now:

&gt;***The unspoken implication is that at least a small proportion of these sightings may relate to what is called NHI – non-human intelligence. If that were to turn out to be true, the consequences for our worldview as the human species would make the Copernican revolution pale into insignificance. Serious research is more than warranted.***

And yet another mainstream article calling out Sean Kirkpatrick for his Calvine UFO photo debunk:

&gt;***There is*** [***no credible evidence***](https://shura.shu.ac.uk/34877/) ***to support Sean Kirkpatrick’s suggestion that the photograph is the reflection of a rock in a lake, nor is it an image of*** [***a mountain top peeking through low-lying cloud***](https://anthologycouk.substack.com/p/could-the-calvine-ufo-actually-be) ***as the MoD suggests. It should be noted that in 1992 British intelligence shared the photograph*** [***with the US Department of Defense***](https://drdavidclarke.co.uk/secret-files/the-calvine-ufo-photographs/)***, which undertook its own analysis. It would be interesting indeed if these missing documents were to be located and released.***

I cast an eye over our national paper this week and they didn't seem to cover Paulina Luna's announcement about the investigation into jkf et al.

So msm cognitive dissonance or their maintenance of the conspiracy is still firmly locked in place. However every little wiggle will lead to another

Rubio has none of the baggage that almost every other candidate has brought with them.  Hell, even look at Noem.  She's incompetent and not very smart, and some feel that is an issue, but she doesn't have Gabbard, Hegseth, or RFK Jr. level red flags or suspect loyalties.</div>

Exactly. Liberals and progressives might dislike any conservative getting an appointment. However, Rubio might be the least controversial of all the nominees for these positions. 

Dislike his political views all you want, he is very experienced, a ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and generally liked by both sides. 

I'm not saying he's a **good** pick. Just that he's non-controversial.</div>

It fills me with anger and frustration. Passive income is the way to go. Easier said than done, I know.

I was like this, because my father was like this, and I'll be real: we were assholes and so are you.  Your friends don't really like it as much as you think they do.  And why in the world would YOU being able to "take a joke" mean the people around you enjoy being treated this way?

(Though this stuff can manifest in a Sick System, where everybody's an asshole and everybody needs to do some work on themselves.)

I recommend finding some material on Active Listening.  Because you're not even really listening to people with your full attention, you're just looking for the hook.  You're treating them like material, not people.  But just the basics of Active Listening will help you slow down and think before you speak, and your priorities will start to shift.

There's a really good book called The Art of Showing Up: How to Be There for Yourself and Your People.  It's one of those "If I could give every 16yo a personal library, this would be in it" books for me.  It also gets at the heart of this behavior: if you're treating other people like this, your own self-esteem isn't great either.</div>

That said, OP does seem to be going at it somewhat... obsessively. And it seems to be causing him distress. That is a valid reason to want to seek a different way of thinking/feeling, even if his friends never wanted or needed him to change.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The reason OP included the part about being able to take a joke, I’m guessing, is because people who dish it out but can’t take it are pretty much universally reviled, where people prepared to engage in two-way banter are appreciated by at least *some* people.

I’m not saying that’s an excuse, and OP is clearly trying to change this trait, but at least there’s an audience for that type of person. I’ve never heard anyone say, “I really appreciate how that guy rips on everyone and then throws a tantrum if you say anything to him. You’ve gotta respect that about a person.”

You don’t always have to roast people, but you must always be able to take what you give.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Keep in mind that you always got laughs....from other teenagers. This is very immature humor. If you said these things aloud now most adults would wonder why you are acting like a stupid teen. 

What is edgy and hilarious to a teenager is usually cringy for an adult. Stop seeing yourself as funny and clever for these thoughts. When you think of them, correctly identify them as cringy and emabarrasingly adolescent. That reframe may help you get less satisfaction from roasting people in your head.</div>

Old comedy tv shows and movies from the 90s and early 00’s are far more about mean targeted humour than wholesome laughs. I’ve been shocked going back and rewatching some things that I loved when they were first released.</div>
