MASS was trained on observational data from various physical systems (like pendulums or oscillators) without being explicitly told the underlying physical laws beforehand. The research found that the theories MASS developed often strongly resembled the known Hamiltonian or Lagrangian formulations of classical mechanics, depending on the complexity of the system it was analyzing. It converged on these well-established physi...</div>

1) generalised coordinates (gen positions and time derivatives)
2) the condition that everything is described by a single scalar that depends on them


completely undermines the idea that the AI came up with it independently. Those are two huge hints and pretty much restrict any correct output to be Hamiltonian or Lagrangian based.


Knowing that a physical system can be predicted from a scalar evaluated only on 0th and 1st derivatives is highly non-trivial and was basically the most important step in deriving the action principle in the first place.</div>

Lagrange systematically used generalized coordinates (positions and velocities) in his *Mécanique Analytique*. This doesn't really take away from what the AI did.</div>

E.g. use RL to reward models for coming up with the next year's science (like mathematics discoveries between 1945 and 1946 etc). Of course you'd be limited to science that is purely theoretical or could be simulated somehow (Maybe since you know experimental outcomes from the past you have an up to date LLM provide outcomes to proposed experiments). </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My job manages fundraising and philanthropic giving programs.

One of our largest regular donors owns a construction company that has a program hiring recently released ex-convicts to help them get back on their feet so they don’t have to fall back in to crime to support themselves. The majority of people in the program are minorities.

He lost several federal contracts because that program is considered “DEI”.

That closes a work program that reduces recidivism rates for former criminals, potentially shuts down a business this guy built from the ground up, and takes money out of charities he had been donating to for years.

All because he was hiring too many black and brown people.</div>

The PRODUCT of this process will be hyper advanced RL algorithms that have true cognitive structures and will ace most AGI benchmarks.  Then THOSE algorithms will be used to do what we call "RSI".</div>

*Observed today in Nowy Targ, Poland. I received the video from one of my readers and shared it on Facebook. Some people believe it might be a military exercise or possibly parachute jumps. However, I’ve never seen any military drills like this since I started following this topic — but maybe I just haven’t seen enough in my life. Many local residents witnessed it. I'm waiting for more footage to come in.*</div>

Considering the geopolitical situation and from what I know about Poland's position on the situation, military exercises could be an explanation.

The flight path doesn't show any anomalies. More than that, I don't know...

I feel like I'm wasting my life in a way nobody else has done in the past generations. I check my email as a nervous tick, there's nothing on there.

                        <div class="comment-body">I was interested in nostalgia mode before, but is not necesary to idolize the past, what we want is an specific use and not beign triggered into doomscrolling for hours after setting a song in spotify.

Here is a list of technology I'm re introducing to replace the smartphone use:

1. Simple, normal analog watches, wrist or walls, whatever you need; an alarm is super important, using the smartphone first thing after waking up is the worst for the brain.
2. Normal Lintern for emergencies.
3. A Camera if you like photos, digital is fine.
4. Mp3 player or similar for music, both portable and non portable, the point is avoiding super interactive screens.
5. Landline phone is very cute and nostalgic, but there is the installation and all that, a dumbphone is enough, just have it at home if you want, anyways people barely do calls now.

You don't need to get ride of the smart phone, I just have it turned off most day, I see it as super portable computer rather than a phone, so if go outside I ask myself if I need that computer or not, for paying certain stuff or other tasks I need it, but most of the times I don't.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">First off, delete all your social media. After two or three days you won’t miss it. 

Read this book called STOLEN FOCUS. It will enlighten you. Your phone and social media are partially to blame for your problems with focus and attention but the causes are greater than that. 

Perhaps get a desktop computer - not a laptop that you carry around everywhere. Keep that computer at a desk in your home. That is where you now access the internet. 

Take email off your phone. Keep things like maps, Spotify, weather, your camera app, and things like that. I’m 36 and BELIEVE ME, i wish I had those when i was in high school and college. 

Practice being bored again. Waiting in line to order food at a restaurant? Don’t look at your phone. Walking to the bathroom? Don’t bring your phone. Getting lunch with a friend? Leave the phone in your car. These little steps will change a ton for you!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I second the idea of learning to be bored again. I practice it regularly, standing in lines and such. I'm in my sixties so was in college before any kind of cell phone was available. In the years since then I found that In the moment boredom sucks, but it leads to communicating with people around you (even making new friends like I did talking to people in the halls between classes), being aware of the moment and living in it, and maybe using the time to think about things a little more in depth. 

Our brains need a break from the constant input. Boredom is underrated in the modern world, and the compulsion to kill boredom is killing our ability to think creatively. That's my experience anyway.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm going to say that the 90's and early 2000's looked a lot better than they actually were. I think a lot of younger people see happy photos and cool things and think that's a reflection of reality.


What you see as the 90's is the photos people took and the millennial memory. Photos were expensive, and so only things people wanted to remember were photographed. Everything else either didn't get photographed or the pictured were thrown away. The millennial memory is from a time back when they were all told Disney-esque lies but before the ramifications smacked them in the face.


I can tell you how to live 90's tech-wise for anything you want. For the phone, I would recommend a flip phone with a Bluetooth landline adapter. It's going to be the cheapest and most configurable option. If you get an actual landline VoIP box, they can hold your phone number hostage after you've given it to people.


For an alarm clock, just go to Walmart and get an radio clock. Nobody had alarm clocks with a CD player. They just tune to whatever station they like and set the time. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">As a millennial that grew up in the 90s, this is absolutely correct. It's kinda funny seeing the 90s being romanticized now similarly to older decades.

One thing I want to add, if you truly want to live like the 90s, be prepared to be bored. Our devices to "kill time" were very rudimentary; no social media in our pockets, no scrolling.

As a kid, I developed a wild imagination because there was nothing else to do sometimes. Like looking out the window in a car and imagining a ninja jumping on the buildings we drove by. Or on a rainy day, I'd "race" the water droplets on the window and silently cheer for one to reach the edge first. Sometimes I would imagine whole stories/ideas I could have written in a fantasy novel when I had nothing better to do. Yeah we had CD players and Gameboys, but those could only entertain for so long before they got boring too. 

And don't get me wrong. Boredom is actually healthy for your brain. It forces you to get creative and motivates you to do things. Nowadays, phone scrolling artificially soothes that boredom and makes you lay dormant for hours at a time.

But it is a challenge to get used to boredom again.</div>

They have caused too much hype for GPT-5 and if they would release a model named GPT-5 and it disappoints it would cause evaluation to plummet or perhaps even spook investors so much it could cause another AI-winter.

Hence the weird naming schemes all of these companies employ, hoping to prevent people to form expectations of new models compared to the past which obfuscates how good (or bad) the progress between newer systems is.</div>

It's giving me all sorts of insight into the contract, and flat out said "Do not sign this version of the contract under any circumstances." And it listed out the various reasons why. 

I'm not an idiot, so I am working with a business lawyer to review it.

But everything that Gemini called out, the lawyer called out. And I was able to state "&lt;section #&gt; is not clear in this regard" because Gemini already pointed that out. For a few different sections.

And this stuff is only going to get smarter. I am wondering at what point I'll personally feel confident not engaging with a human expert.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">We already know how to make things better.

The problem is NOT the knowledge, the problem is THE TYRANTS IN CHARGE DO NOT LISTEN.

* We Know How To Solve Global Warming: STOP BURNING OIL.
* We Know How To Solve Homelessness: GIVE PEOPLE HOMES.
* We Know How To Solve Drug Addiction: REMOVE THE HARMFUL DRUGS AND GIVE PEOPLE SUPPORT.
* We Know How To Solve Poverty: GIVE PEOPLE MONEY.
* We Know How To Solve Hunger: GIVE PEOPLE FOOD.

If we invent a superintelligent computer and ask it those questions, it will give us the same answers.

But the way society is currently structured, greed and addiction to money prevents any of those problems from being adequately solved.

The ONLY way AI / AGI will improve society is if it can be allowed to take control of society to run it on behalf of the people. But there will be a lot of billionaires and very powerful people who oppose this because - even if they don't lose a single dollar - it will diminish their control over the rest of society.

Science fiction stories about machines going to war usually frame them as an enemy - but there's a rapidly improving possibility that a super AGI machine could decide to go to war against the tyrants who refuse to listen to the will of the people.</div>

Now emergent capabilities gotta improve. Its still insane that the models dont seem to learn the patterns of i.e multiplication. This is a huge flaw.

                                <div class="reply-body">Beating pokemon would be fairly doable if they specifically designed models for it. They are going to focus more on new science instead. I'm sure he'd figure it out eventually so this is an imperfect analogy, but Issac Newton would probably struggle with pokemon if a time traveller handed him a gameboy.

The models don't even have a consistent stream of video based input yet. And it's not a capability issue, it's more of a cost issue.

That said, i doubt we'll be getting a solid innovator, i.e., something that can do good, consistent new science, before the average model is an agent decent at beating pokemon. I'd give it a couple of years.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Don’t get me wrong: I’m aware of and acknowledge how closed a company called “OpenAI” has been since early GPT-4 days, and I hate arguing in a manner that advocates for a such a company… But, as hated as they are for their principle backwardness…

They have constantly, and with almost every major release, completely changed the game. Just think:
- GPT 3.5: I would (without evidence) argue that 80% of the members of this subreddit would not be here right now if it weren’t for GPT-3.5
- GPT-4: I mean, seriously, we still have commenters that swear and stand by the original GPT-4. They argue that it was something different, something that understands and acts on users’ intents in a way that is just different (hindsight bias could be the case, but a lot of people advocate for the original GPT-4 in the same way they advocate for Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- GPT-4o: This is self-explanatory. It was one of the first models that unified multi-modal inputs and outputs, all while maintaining a generalist coherence that is accurate, fast, and without question, SOTA
- o1 &amp; o3 Mini: Like many enthusiasts suspected (even the crooked Reflection 70B model, which claimed to allow a model to reflexively and iteratively improve its own outputs), the models can analyze, assess, and refine their own outputs (hence the inference-time scaling paradigm we’ve seen recently). Whether it’s internalizing a CoT that plans before outputting or recognizes its own errors, asking for consensus views from many models in a panel-like format, or running 64 generations on a benchmark and picking the best outputs to synthesize a response from, it has been known (or at least theorized) for a while that maybe, just maybe, the model’s first output to a user prompt is not optimized, ideal, or correct, but ALSO, that the same model that generated the output might be able to review and improve upon its own initial output. o1 and o3 Mini (and DeepSeek, via GRPO) have definitively proven that this concept is feasible and functional.
- GPT 4.5: Although it lacks the brute-force powers of other reasoning models, this base model is LARGE, uses amazing datasets in pretraining, and consistently surprises even the most seasoned LLM users. Once this model’s output is used to train some form of reasoning model, I have no doubt that it will be SOTA and competitive (if not just better) than any other of the models of similar size.

We’ve seen a paradigm shift: models’ intelligence can be distilled to smaller models. Models can assess, edit, and IMPROVE their own outputs if given the proper prompts and context. Without question, OpenAI has consistently surprised and retained the lead that many suspected them to have since the early days of GPT.

So, all of this is to say: I would not be surprised if they have something special. Their models and releases have consistently surprised others, changed the game, and inspired other companies and research efforts to match their performance and features. Whether it’s image generation and editing or solidifying the concept of reasoning models in a practical way, the technology itself has significantly improved and OpenAI has consistently set the bar for this performance level. 

I hope what they are claiming is true as it would be beneficial to all of humanity. As much as I hate many of the company’s principles, their lack of openness, and their product-hyping executives, they have consistently changed the game by delivering SOTA products that encourage competition from other AI companies and research efforts. I can only go forward assuming/hoping that this post has some level of truth to it.</div>

I didn’t expect much, but it ended up completely transforming how I manage my day.

Could be simple or unconventional, just something that made a real difference.

Paired with
“Do things tired.”

If there is something that will take 1-2 minutes then just set a timer and go pound it out. Just **execute** it. We don’t need to put it on a list or think about doing it when I have more energy. I was like a procrastinator for little things and if I just set 2 minute timers and do it 5 times that’s 10 minutes but I can normally get a bunch of little things done. Clear my mind. Get a dopamine bump of accomplishment. Then take a 15 minute nap if needed.</div>

Dress up: Even if I’m not leaving the house, changing into something a step above loungewear tricks my brain into “show up” mode.  
Fake commute: A quick walk around the block or even just making coffee while listening to a podcast helps me mentally shift into work mode.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I try to keep work in one specific area of the house and avoid mixing it with relaxation spaces. I also use the Pomodoro Technique, where I work for specific hours and then take short breaks. It helps me stay focused without feeling burned out. 

On tough days, I try to break tasks into smaller chunks so it feels more manageable. But honestly, it's ok to not be perfect everyday because some days will be harder than others, and that's normal.</div>

But him completely ignoring what's going on and what his friends are doing really disappointed me. He's obviously trying to keep an audience because of his family, but it goes completely against what he preached about for years. It goes to show how truly fake people are. All these people want is more money. Even the gurus he claims to admire and learn from just wanted more power and money. Humans are all animals that just want to be at the top of a tree.</div>

FAA Drone Detection Testing

Friday, April 11, 2025

[https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-drone-detection-testing](https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-drone-detection-testing)

Now it's Official!

It wasn't Trump who said it, nor his secretary or Fox.

It was the FAA itself, on its official website, that confirmed this operation.

Could it be that they are predicting a new wave of Drones (UFOs)?

People in this area should be careful, because in these two weeks, the sky should be quite agitated in this region.

Good images may emerge!

                                <div class="reply-body">Boil a frog a live is a good analogy i think. Draconian authoritarianism is usually implemented through a slow but consistent repeal of rights and laws.

People riot if you suddenly take away all of their rights. They don't riot when you do a slow drip over a period of time. Especially when you get half the country on your side and have the people fight each other.

Not to mention, we've become accustomed to issuing our grievances online, where it doesn't really do much of anything. And the people that are actually willing to riot and storm the political offices are on Trump's side.

I don't see people doing much of anything until its far too late.</div>

Liberals right now, they've pretty much all but given up (acceptance). A minority are still fighting and protesting (denial) but the time to stamp this out would have been January 20th when Biden took power. 

Conservatives are in the reasoning stage right now, they got what they wanted and now they're just trying to come to terms with it.</div>
