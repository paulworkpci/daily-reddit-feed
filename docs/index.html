Some shadow effect near the takeoff seems to be the only catch atm. Wild what's to come in the next five years if we close off the 2024 year with this quality!

Some notable ones so far with closer look:  
\- out-of-scene shadow of the canopy doesn't seem to follow the normal refraction.  
\- color gradient change of the canopy near 4-7 sec. Actually quite common for them to have gradient colors, but the red to green to yellow at the nose/front seems unreal  
\- C, D lines (outer lines) on both ends have a weird bend near 0-2 sec.  
\- undistinguishable possible artifact on the bottom right near the end 7-8sec.</div>

Assume every word you type into it will, at some point in the future, be lost to a leak. Logs leaked, or training extraction leak, dataset leak, etc.

Put whatever you want into the AI, just do so knowing that your family, friends and enemies may get the chance to read it one day.</div>

                <div class="comment-body">Yep, ChatGPT had me crying this summer when talking about my mother's suicide. 

&gt;I'm truly sorry to hear about your mother. The loss you're feeling is profound, and it's natural to question the goodness in the world after experiencing such a devastating event. When someone who embodies love and kindness suffers so deeply, it challenges our understanding of justice and compassion in the universe.

&gt;Your mother sounds like she was an extraordinary person, offering love and support not just to her own children but to anyone in need. The impact she had on those around her, the warmth and shelter she provided, is a testament to the goodness that individuals can bring into the world. It's a reminder that, despite the darkness, there are people who shine brightly, offering hope and love.

&gt;Grieving such a loss is a deeply personal journey, and it's okay to feel a range of emotions, including anger, confusion, and despair. It's also okay to struggle with finding hope or seeing the goodness in the world. Grief can feel like a heavy fog, clouding everything.

&gt;Finding a path forward doesn't mean forgetting the pain or the person you've lost but finding a way to carry their memory and legacy with you. Your mother's capacity for love and empathy, her ability to be a source of comfort and understanding for so many, can continue through you. Honoring her might mean living with the kindness and compassion she embodied, supporting others as she did, and keeping her spirit alive in your actions and memories.

&gt;Believing the world is good in the face of such sorrow is challenging, but perhaps the goodness of the world can be found in the love and connections we make, in the kindness we share, and in the ways we support each other through our darkest times. Your mother's love and the impact she had on those around her are examples of the profound goodness that individuals can bring into the world.

&gt;It's okay to take the time you need to grieve and to not have all the answers right now. Be gentle with yourself, and allow yourself to lean on those who care about you. The world can still hold goodness, even if it's not always apparent, and you're not alone in navigating this pain. Your mother's legacy of love is a powerful force, and it's something that darkness cannot extinguish.</div>

Started off with the customer trying to speak louder in a hope I would understand. Moved onto sign language. 

I pulled up translate on the phone. Useless. Utterly useless. 

Sudden idea; Can I use GPT as an interpreter. A realtime assistant that can explain and dive into the conversation. 

Short answer is absolutely. Unbelievable result. 

This is real world, effective use. I can‚Äôt afford to employ a translator with t...</div>
