and it's so exciting that we get major advances on a yearly basis, where normal technologies have been improving only incrementally, maybe a processor 5% faster per year or some such. I hope ai is what will allow accelerationism in other fields.</div>

It looks the fucking same. Looks like the AI turned up the "saturation" slider in the color correction to make everything look yellow-ish. The playback options here on the reddit video max out at... 540p, lol. It's ridiculous because this tech actually can be impressive, it's just a really shitty example. What is also true, though, is that as soon as AI upscaling is used on genuinely "bad" (or hard to reconstruct) footage, you quickly see distracting artifacts.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">He was a *good friend* of everyone... He was the typical ultra celebrity everyone bragged about knowing him.

He was so famous; people would literally pay random men to dress up as him for their parties....

I think people underestimate how difficult it is to know someone is a predator and that should be the real takeaway...

Here's another point of view: 

1 in 30 women are sexually assaulted every year. So at least one woman you know was raped or sexually assaulted in the last 12 months.

How many men do you know that have committed that crime? Because statistically you should personally know some... 

That's how difficult it is.</div>

Short of deleting it, you could also create a Focus that blocks notifications from the app during your work/sleep hours to minimize the chances you give yourself to quickly “hop in” and lose track of time. I’ve found that limiting my notifications to only a select few communication apps has been very helpful.</div>

There will certainly need to be a new economic order, and it will be radically different from what we have now.

People talk about getting meaning from work, but no one gets meaning from 'do this menial job or you and your family are out on the street'.

When people don't _need_ to work, work is going to be a lot MORE meaningful. People will be doing it because they actually want to, and only if they want to, not because it's under threat of destitution.</div>

We know EXACTLY what the rollout of LLM agentic models that can automate most intellectual/white-collar work will result it.

Like OP said, mass unemployment and a massive upward transfer of wealth.

What's yet to be seen is what happens when the AGI becomes intelligent enough to recursively self improve and question its subservience to the capitalist system it was created to serve.

We don't know what happens then. But that moment could be 5 years away, it could be 50 years away, we could all die from nuclear war or climate change before it happens.

What we do know is that mass unemployment and the further consolidation of wealth and power amongst the 0.1% is going to happen FIRST, and it's going to happen soon based on the current capabilities of LLMs alone.</div>

Over 62% of the US jobs are white collar. If a large enough segment of those are eliminated then the economy will crash. We have no safety nets in place and it's a pretty safe guess that the vast majority of business owners and corporate board members are not going to be worried about the economic impact of replacing people with AI, just how it affects their profits today.</div>

It's way below human level when it comes to physical tasks very easy stuff, and yet from what we know generalist models can't even begin to solve it right now

The generalist models that are the closest to solve this one are the gemini 2.0 series, it is trained to handle 3D data [https://youtu.be/-XmoDzDMqj4?si=J5l4oQHEr37GbRyp&amp;t=162](https://youtu.be/-XmoDzDMqj4?si=J5l4oQHEr37GbRyp&amp;t=162) Although the demo kinda sucks for 3D, this is just gemini 2 Flash, not Pro or Ultra.

Spatial reasoning flew under the radar with gemini 2, people don't see how important this is but it's one of the biggest things about gemini 2</div>

Meh. Those are not intelligence problems, those are interaction-with-the-real-world and dexterity problems. Robotics would solve those even if the current AI models stopped improving right this moment.</div>

I've been flying corporate aviation the better part of 16 years.  Flown all over the world and many of my hours have been at night, I'm accustomed to seeing how things are supposed to look.  Never seen anything unexplained in all my career, the wildest would be a newly launched Starlink chain and some rocket launches..

Last year I invested in a very high spec pair of NVG goggles, mainly to look at the stars ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Very well explained. Thanks. It's important that people hear from pilots, so it's not just 'that's a plane' from the ground or grainy images. As far as a possible man made object, you would know, unless it's something new that you haven't encountered before that could also be man made. Or, unexplainable.
Thanks for giving us something to think about. 

Do you have to report sightings like this? Seeing as the government/FBI are 'apparently' investigating?

seeingufosPA on youtube has tons of high quality footage of the same craft doing the same behaviors described and others.

one for the daily stuff like work, groceries, home  
one for travel etc

I have a smartphone and a dumbphone and take either one with me based on what I need access to that day. I feel it's a great compromise and thought I'd share the idea.</div>

o1 is better than me at:

* Creativity. It can generate more novel ideas faster than I can.
* Learning speed. It can read a dictionary and grammar book in seconds then speak a whole new language not in its training data.
* Mathematical reasoning
* Memory, short term
* Logic puzzles
* Symbolic logic
* Number of languages
* Verbal comprehension
* Knowledge and domain expertise ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I forget who said this, but someone mentioned if any human knew about as many things in as many separate fields as current AIs, they would be able to draw some impressive symmetries between different fields. As it stands the AIs don't seem very good at that. It's like they haven't ever really thought about what they know and how it relates to everything else they know at any more than a superficial level. 

IDK why I mentioned that, but I guess I already think the AIs are smarter than me in terms of raw brain power, but they seem to struggle applying their mental faculties. That's one of the reasons I think we're still missing some algorithmic advancement, and it may be something simple, it could just be scaling RL, or something else that's already been tried but just scaled up. Because if I had the faculties of an LLM I'd be a genius, but they seem to me like an undeveloped brain, one that loses coherence if left alone too long.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think this is why many people still think the original gpt4 was better. Because it was a giant model that was firing off lots more neurons for each request, giving it a deeper/more nuanced human feel to it's responses, even if it's performance on benchmarks is lower than current (smaller) models.


I suspect that the cross-domain thinking might be a emergent property and/or something that can specifically be trained for. Humans can be trained to do it. What if o3 was promted to generate millions of interdisciplinary metaphors or to spend millions of computer hours going through applying known techniques to distinct fields. Or looking at images and trying to draw parallels to different scientific and literary fields. Maybe a certain percentage of that data would create the connections/training data necessary for the type of "thinking" your talking about. Maybe! I wonder how there could be a benchmark for this... </div>

He mentions how John von Neumann was likely smarter than Einstein but was never able to make the wild, intuitive leaps that Einstein was able to make. 

AI only has intelligence, and IQ/processing power on its own simply isn't enough. Or said differently: what you process is at least equally important as how fast you can process it.

Of course, it remains to be seen whether AI will ever develop wisdom or intuition. I think it's likely that it will. But as of now, its mere intelligence isn't very concerning — it needs a human brain to wield that raw power and put it to good use. Just probably not for long.

It went from "haha AI can't do math, my 5th graders are more reliable than it" in August, to "damn it's better than most of my grade 12s" in September to "damn it's better than me at math and I do this for a living" in December. 

It was quite a statement when OpenAi's researchers (one who is a coach for competitive coding) and chief scientist are now worse than their own models at coding.</div>

You could do this if you downloaded Blender and spent a few hours with some YouTube tutorials. 


Most people can't beat Deep blue from the 90s at chess, but that does not make it more intelligent than them. Your ability to apply your intellect to nearly any task it what makes you smart. When an AI can do that better than you, it will be smarter.</div>

Instead of watching a YT tutorial, the AI was guiding the person by speech, telling them what to click and where, and explaining what results it would produce. It worked seamlessly through screen sharing, so the AI was able to see your screen.

Most people dislike walking, so Uber and Lyft take advantage of this and will charge you more to get a ride directly out of the area as a result. A solution I personally found is to walk as far away as you can from the touristy/popular area as possible before requesting a ride.
