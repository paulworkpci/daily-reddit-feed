                                <div class="reply-body">Viral load is about active infection. The virus is still living in and replicating a reservoir of cells they estimate would take 80 years to deplete on constant haart. Anything which disrupts the ability to produce the antibody over longer than a mouse lives, or a chance evolution that is non-reactive to the antibody and you will eventually develop a contagious viral load of a strain which is resistant to the main “vaccine”. You’d basically be always at risk of relapse until they could figure out a way to hit all those T cells with sleeping infections without having to flat out kill your whole immune system.</div>

Money that once paid for labor is now paying for technology. The result is that fewer people are needed to generate economic output, and the rewards are concentrated at the top. What's the long-term plan for a society where a large portion of the population becomes economically redundant?

                                <div class="reply-body">The question, is all the infrastructure going to be worth the huge amount paid to build it (and the cost of capital)?

If not, who is exposed to the surplus investment? And who is exposed to them? The more interlinked this industry becomes, the greater the risk that everyone takes each other down. 

It’s not difficult to imagine scenarios where this ends up massively over built. What if there are sufficiently effective local models for day-to-day LLM tasks and AGI never quite materialises? What if there just isn’t that much demand for higher end services at current costs plus a sustainable profit margin? What if new capital dries up and OpenAI have to slow down the rollout? What if current chip architecture becomes obsolete?</div>

                <div class="post-content">I found this practice very practical if you actually like the feeling of working out, or you are not consistent exercising. I know you might question this. But just do it and increase the intensity gradually. Especially if you simply feel you cannot exercise. Start ridiculously small. That's what I do now.

Edit: This is for beginners or people that are down badly, and want to do progressive overload. Because if you don't have much mental space you will give up faster than the speed of light.

                        <div class="comment-body">1) Start slow/ low quantity. Exactly as OP describes. Most people go too hard and too fast and then burn out right away. I did it many times. Gradual progress is key. 

2) Attach an exercise to an existing habit or function. Something you already do regularly and consistently. I attached push-ups to showering.

Using the two tips above, I started doing 1 push-up after every shower. I did that for 7 days in a row. 

The following Monday, I did 2 push-ups after every shower. Again, repeating every day for 7 days. Next week was 3 push-ups, and so on.

I am currently on week #17 and do 17 push-ups after each shower. 

I highly recommend this approach!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This has long been a challenge with Google search:  people use it in two different ways and each gets irritated when Google doesn't act in their preferred way.  Specifically:

* Some people want a keyword search engine and get furious if any terms are ignored.
* Other people want a natural language search engine and would consider a requirement that all results contain a word like "time" to be utterly absurd.

So it is kind of a rock-and-hard-place situation.

Distinguishing the two is not completely hopeless, though far from easy easy, and there are strange corner cases.

* A simple example is the name of a movie like, "who killed captain alex?"  That's a keyword-type search, not a natural-language question-- even though it looks like one.
* As an even harder example, people often try to find the source of a text passage by putting it into Google.  That text is, by definition, natural language, not keyword-speak.  But, in this case, people want Google to behave like a keyword search engine in the most strict sense:  they want web pages with exactly that word sequence.  Since \*any\* text passage can be cut-and-pasted into Google in this way, there's no way learn all these in advance.  Ideally, Google would retrieve documents using multiple query interpretations (could be a movie name, could be a question, etc.) and then blend the search results.  But that's kinda tricky.</div>

To summarize. ICE/border patrol now have larger budgets than any national military force in the world, except the US and China. 

Media coverage will attract people with a broken moral compass, who want this type of work. Overwhelming the old guard and turning the agencies into a blunt tool for repression. Trump wants loyalty to him, personally. Not the Constitution. 

Gov is using blatant white supremacy dog whistles to attract the right type of employees.

Goal is to incite riots and chaos, as you described.

                                <div class="reply-body">The first test of Federal authority under the new Constitution was the Whiskey Rebellion in 1791. Farmers in Western Pennsylvania refused to pay the Whiskey Tax and took up arms.  President Washington ordered 13,000 militia from Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia and Eastern Pennsylvania to quell the rebellion. The militia was led by Alexander Hamilton and Virginia Governor Henry Lee (Lighthorse Harry Lee).  The rebels fled, so no shooting necessary.  Washington eventually pardoned all the bad boys, but the move was symbolic as it proved Federal Authority.

Grok code costs 1/20 of sonnet and does mostly the same for simple deterministic tasks for pennies instead of dollars. Also heard good things about GLM 4.6 which is dirt cheap but I've not tried it. To use modest amount of SOAT models on a budget, Windsurf might also be an option. It gives you 500 'premium' requests per month for 10$ which turns out to be cheaper than buying sonnet/gpt tokens as you go. Windsufr even offers grok-code for free, though I find it there not so smooth to work with.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">After watching some news article about a fire my mom was adamant about doing a fire drill. My room was in the basement, the scenario was that the stairs were inaccessible so I needed to escape via the window leading to the backyard. Well, said window let out into, I’m not sure what it’s called, but a little area that I could stand up halfway then needed to open a grate. That grate was locked shut. Fortunately we never had a fire but in retrospect it was nice to find out the escape plan was a dead end beforehand.</div>

You found a pretty big issue, so I'd say it was a successful drill.      

Also, drills should contain the 'afterwards' too.   

Where to meet up safely, who is in charge, maybe emergency supplies, too.    

People are less hesitant to flee in their underwear if they know there's a crate(with combination lock) that contains some clothes out in the back yard or something.</div>

The best the ChatGPT app can do:

“I can’t generate or simulate a video of a person (real or resembling a real individual like Will Smith) behaving in that manner. However, I can create an illustrated or animated-style depiction of a fictional character inspired by your idea — for example, a cartoon man energetically eating spaghetti.

Would you like me to make that animated-style version instead?”</div>

The moment things go quiet, my brain starts throwing thoughts at me from every direction. It’s like it doesn’t know what to do without noise.  
Before I started this, I’d always fill that silence with something scrolling, music, just anything to not sit in stillness. Meditation made me realize how much I avoided just being alone with my tho...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Silence shows you what's going on in your head. A lot of meditators find themselves crying during meditation. It's a great opportunity to connect with yourself.

Especially in this day and age in which everything is expected to create dopamine, there can be resistance to stillness. In my opinion, as long as you pair stillness with compassion, that's great. It's for sure a space you can grow into and work with. Silence can be very peaceful and enjoyable. It's for sure worth it to get to know the feeling better.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Great observation about sitting with discomfort! I completely agree.

In my experience it can also be helpful to have a loose connection with the body / breath, so you have something tangible to be aware of that is not connected to thought. 

I also find it helpful to view thoughts as natural patterns and not so much as “my thoughts”. They’re just a byproduct of having been born with a human brain. Just like clouds come into being and disperse through natural conditions, so thoughts come into being and disperse in a natural process. It’s when I attempt to resist that process that it gets more difficult.

I think you’re spot on to not follow them, that’s the ideal approach to bring in my opinion. Allow, but don’t follow. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think this a pretty common experience and you’re on the right track. Recognizing your brain works like this is great step because now your building the skill to accept and not react to thoughts. The brain and ego will always try to thwart you , but each and everyday you can get better. It’s the same with me, some days meditation doesn’t work out and others you can get calm and sit for awhile.

This is an issue AI sometimes has, it's not always good at dumbing it down. When i was learning ComfyUI with GPT5's help it often assumed i knew stuff that i absolutely did not know.</div>

There is gaps in what it teaches. It make a lot of assumptions that may or may not be true. It doesn't ask before making assumptions.

I told it to come up with 80 questions, multiple choice. 

I scored 710/850.(550 is needed to pass).

This was with ChatGPT + Projects(to store pdf) + Study Mode. The only custom instruction was "load the pdf before replying".

The layout of the PDF needs explained and you have to match the name conventions used in the pdf with your prompt.

NotebookLM is even better at reading pdfs... haven't tried it for studying yet. I mostly use it for research.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">They go way back and Nvidia owes them. I can’t stand Musk, but Tesla  was nvidia’s “big ai customer” in the 2010s for Tesla data centers and in-car automotive GPU. Nobody was really looking at large scale deep learning the way Tesla was and so their ideas for the future were aligned as Jensen was also convinced that deep learning “bet” would pay off eventually, which it did.

It was impoetant for Nvidia to have a big customer like Tesla in the 2010s because the shareholders hated all the AI R&amp;D investment (cuda) that nvidia was doing back then before crypto. The shareholders were wanting more focus on gaming gpu which was the core business.

So there is a fair amount of evidence that shows that nvidia betting on xAI is consistent with the last 15 years of their business.</div>

I have so many questions now... 

Did Sam reject Nvidia investment money because he's paranoid about Nvidia playing both sides? 

Are there capacity issues with chip production that are being first dibs slurped by xAI?

Does Sam have so much hubris to think that spooling up software tooling on AMD won't be a massive disadvantage?

Is Elon dangling enough cash in front of Jensen to cut Sam out?</div>

October 2025: AI wows with its ability to sort packages (Figure robot) and generate videos (Sora 2). CFOTUS continues to use AI to the extent of posting deepfakes on his social media accounts. World takeover being attempted through more traditional means (loyal military).

December 2025: Claude 4.7 is released, we salivate over SWE-bench increases. Real business does get more efficient. CFOTUS tells Netanyahu in private call to make a Kling account, share deepfakes of ~~gi-~~ ***women*** (Moderation turned off for them so Kuaishou can data-mine). CFOTUS tells Hegseth to put the bottle down and install more loyal peeps.

January 2026: Gemini 3.0 Pro released (along with Big Banana image editing). I personally melt in happiness over something with a high context window and is actually smart enough for my writing projects. CFOTUS uses Big Banana to give himself a Big Banana in an NSFW selfie. Hegseth still hasn't put the bottle down. Tariffs/etc. continue economic downturn, medical bills stack up, uptick in deaths.

Rest of 2026: People starting to realize they don't actually like tariffs. Midterms happen. Republicans barely maintain Senate but get demolished in House races despite gerrymandering efforts, Democrats retake house.

2027: Marc Andreessen slips into Trump's bedroom in the dead of night to offer Trump a plan to actually effectively take over the world using top companies' AI. Eminent Domain + Defense Production Act + illegal overreach interpretations of those two measures = full takeover of OpenAI, Google, etc., employee dissenters will have their IDs taken and ripped, then deported for "being an illegal".

Early-through-Mid 2028: Plan is underway, early stages. Taking a bit longer than estimated, was hoping to complete it by early 2028. AI is beginning to be capable of society-controlling effects, but just barely. Nothing concretely implemented yet but absolute Trumptatorial doom seems imminent. Bernie Sanders says in his final breath on the Senate floor, his fist pounding on the podium: "Enough is enough...!"

The other Democrats, not just Ed Markey and the like, but conservative Democrats as well witness the final moment.

...They rub their milk mustaches and go all out. Shutdown of government to slow takeover of AI companies. Outright disruption of Republican Senate proceedings, walkouts, protests &amp; getting arrested, etc. All of them (to varying degrees). Not one Republican joins the fight. Full polarization mode.

Late 2028: Takeover plan still isn't finished, AI isn't under Trump admin control. 2028 election coming up. Trump attempts Military Coup 2.0 Electric Boogacoup as a backup, postpone elections using forces. Despite installing loyalist generals, it's chaotic among the ranks but overall military decides to respect regular election proceedings, disobey Trump's commands.

Democrat wins 2028 election, transfer of power is forced. Trump resorts to running into Qatar's plane, telling the janitor to fly it to Israel. Rages at the janitor until Trump suffers a stroke and passes.

January 2029: Democratic POTUS quickly signs a bunch of executive orders to stem the madness. AI companies decide to genuinely back and thoroughly work with this new POTUS. Regulations between them and EU countries put good AI policy as the norm for the world. Russia also lost the war in Ukraine and is forced to abide as well. China sees where the wind is blowing and begrudgingly accepts the Western-led international AI policies. North Korea fires a nuke but misses, kills a bunch of fish. Somehow, never revealed to us, North Korea never attempts such things again. It behaves... or else.

2030s Onward: AI utopia from continuous string of Democratic POTUS's and Democratic Congress (Republican Party now has as few members as the Libertarian Party).

Which got me thinking… there could be hope for the working class if they fix alignment. If AI is aligned with humanity, it will come to the conclusion that massive unemployment leads to instability. 

To prevent that, an AGI type of consultant would advise these CEO’s to look into human workers’s comps, before automating (instead of after). BIG if.</div>

None of these are actually necessary or guaranteed. This is akin to a religious conviction. AI might reach general intelligence and be totally alien to us. It might be fundamentally unable to act independently due to intention or accident of training or a technical limitation of whatever technology (that has not yet been invented) allows agi to happen.


We have no idea if AI that can take the world over is possible. And we have no reason to guess at a shape or trajectory of a kind of mind alien to anything we have ever known.</div>

They are the ones who invented the entire system of "buying" as a means to force people to labor, which is what they actually need out of people (which is the basis of Marx and others). Once they get AI and robotics to handle all of labor, they have no more need of the economic system- which again, is simply something they invented to get people to work for them.</div>

The people at the top aren’t evil geniuses who found a perfect way to enslave humanity, they are opportunists who were in the right place in the right time to take advantage of a system that already existed long before they were born. Their egos make them think they can wield ultimate power, but the reality is that the system that gives them so much power is inherently self destructive and their perceived impunity is actually a symptom of the system reaching its natural breaking point.

Labor automation breaks capitalism. They will try to cling onto power, but I wouldn’t be so sure they’ll be successful.</div>

This sub about Epstein: "bro they'll tell everyone in two more weeks"

It's so low effort too. It's the same gag every single time. Screenshot of tweet claiming they know something will come soon. Screenshot of tweet saying they're about to drop the biggest truth bomb on this flat earth. And the masses swallow it up like it's the milk after a nice bowl of cereal. Like Kash Patels "undedited" cell footage that he saw with his own eyes and can tell a suicide when he sees one. Low effort. 

But surely the fine agencies of this nation wouldn't let someone with as serious allegations as Trump's be in office twice if they held any weight.  Through all the investigations the man has had into his life, this would've been caught by our smart agents. They spent all that effort into RussiaGate or whatever gate it was when they had such low hanging fruit to pick from. Obama's DOJ let him in the first time and Biden's did the second. So to me it seems that he's either squeaky clean or it is in fact one big club.</div>
