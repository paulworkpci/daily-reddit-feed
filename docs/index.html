It's significantly cheaper than Claude Code subscriptions, I'm curious if it's worth giving it a try. I mostly use Sonnet 4 via GH Copilot VSC Insiders and while I'm mostly happy with the code output I find this setup quite slow. I also tried Sonnet 4 in Claude Code and haven't notices any code quality improvements, but the agent was faster and I like how CC cli can be customized.

I'm also interested how well these "...</div>

Also as a backup (or for testing diff models other than glm) i have [nanoGPT](https://nano-gpt.com/invite/9yrQteBR) \- also subscription based (8$ / mo for 60k requests per month - pretty awesome deal + you have top opensource models available aswell for different purposes, not coding only). Can recommend both of those - especially now for the current prices as both those in total would cost still less than claude code subscription + will be way more reliable tbh.</div>

Pretending this is an issue with liberals is disingenuous and inflammatory. He got away with it because he knew his audience is comprised of uneducated, bitter losers who want to feel like they're part of the good-guys. 

He was adamantly pro-2a, admitting that he believes that deaths would acceptable. He just didn't think it would impact him directly. He was mistaken. Thoughts and prayers.

                        <div class="comment-body"> Are going to pretend two democratic politicians weren’t murdered in Minnesota 2 months ago?   

It’s not a left or right thing.   This country has a serious gun issue and a serious violence issue and it’s only going to get worse as our politicians on both sides exploit our worst impluses and stoke anger for political points or a couple ticks on opinion polls.   Exactly what he was doing in the post above.

It was awful that he was murdered.   Both I think the issue with some people is that it’s hard to show empathy for a person who made a career of having none for anyone else.  His wife and kids don’t deserve this.  He didn’t deserve this.   But nobody does.   Yet day after day after day it’s repeated in homes and schools across the country.  515 kids killed in schools since 2000.

Yet all we seem to have to offer is thoughts and prayers.</div>

Live by the sword, die by the sword. It's in the fucking Bible.

Not that he actually read it.

Yeah, his kids are fucked. Not only because he helped raise them. I hope they turn out OK. But his wife knew what was up, she gets no sympathy.

He made a living grifting off fear and hate. That was how he made his money. He had no other skills.

The sound and feel of a motor as well as the switching of gears can never be replaced.

The problem with engagement is the weight. If we want a car that's responsive, we need to stop fighting physics and thinking that we can hide two-plus tons of mass behind stupid amounts of horsepower and magnetorheological dampers.

You make an EV that's under 1000kg, and it'll be a kick in the pants.  I've driven EV karts and they're a riot. They also only last a double-digit number laps of an indoor karting track before they need a recharge, so there's a balance to be struck.</div>

The fact that is was so gruesome and someone that supported gun rights makes the imagery stronger. We hear about a lot of death but never quite see it like this.

Even if people didn’t like him seeing a man with a family go limp and shoot blood like that was an image that will stick with me.</div>

The fact that his young children &amp; wife were there &amp; that they almost inevitably will see the videos of his public assassination… has stuck with me &amp; shook me.  I know that sounds as if I’m not shocked by other evil acts, but man the in-your-face-ness of it is really going to change things, I fear for the worse.

when people who call themselves "progressives" are celebrating a dude getting his neck cut open and blood spilling out in front of a crowd that included his kids, we've got a very very broken society. luckily there are still true progressive leaders like Bernie out there.</div>

The two most important parts of any Guacamole recipe are RIPE Avocados and ACID

My personal favorite is:


3 avocados, ripe

¼ cup diced white onion (red looks better but white tastes better)

1 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro

Zest and juice of 2 limes

3 garlic cloves

½ teaspoon sea salt, plus more to taste</div>

It's a percentage chance that a model released at the time would be able to write whole or most of a given text.  

That means that this percentage increases the more structured an a specific a text is. The text of a law for instance will always score nearly 100% because it's intensely structured and follow specific textual rules.  

It obviously doesn't mean it IS written by AI.</div>

I was consistently proficient beyond my grade level in school way back in the 90s and 2000s and wrote short fantasy stories for fun (on AOL's RhyDin roleplay community). My proficiency was to the point that I could, and did on a few occasions, bang out an A- essay on the library computers an hour before the start of class.

I am *immensely* grateful that I got through my education long before the advent of ChatGPT. I would be immeasurably fucked trying to give my writing enough "errors" to not get flagged as AI and zeroed out. :\</div>

If you were to compare speeches today to those 50years ago and in between, there would be a lot of similarities - just because 'tradition'.

But I cannot stress how certain phrases being used by one particular personality get absorbed and used to death by their supporters 

- eg: for the birds, did a round a year ago where it was used consistently by all right/center right talking heads.

I think this is one of those cases where the speech writers like certain types of openings and not necessarily AI.</div>

Yes, I'm real, and as I said, I'm from Spain, and I don't speak English in my day to day life. I drafted my outline in Spanish, and since my English posts have very repetitive and hard to read vocabulary, I asked chatGPT to format it for Reddit, and then I'll review it. But aside from that, what motive would someone have for creating a fake post on this sub? That's what intrigues me most about all of this.

It's a little tiring because I've seen criticism on Reddit when a post isn't written natively in English, and also when it's translated.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Have you tried positive affirmations first thing in the morning and last thing at night? you can watch some videos on them during the afternoon then write down your own to repeat prior to bed and first thing in the morning. this may help you/others to program more positivity/acceptance/gratitude into one's life.

Have you meditated on symbols? like the seed/flower of life. imagine each circle is a supposedly separate/disconnected lifeform/ego and the flower within each is surrounding influences. this is similar to the buddhist concept of "dependent arising." all suffering/attachment/identification is a product of dependent arising.

Have you found happiness/acceptance in the ever present here/now? Have you been able to fully forgive/accept your self and others to find infinite potential within every moment?

I've found that when one is walking and/or moving through time/space it is important to pay careful attention within the here/now. the more one pays time/attention/focus to their physical being in relation to their surroundings the more often they are able to avoid unintentional/unconscious living/being and accidents/mistakes/physical-pain. often when one stubs a toe against furniture or gets in an accident they are often thinking about the past and/or future rather than being fully aware of their surroundings. wish you the best.</div>

About the symbols, it doesn't produce that effect on me to be hones.

  
For the acceptance, it's very difficult to do so, but I'm doing better at handling rage or acceptance this days.</div>

Why it matters?:

* If someone steals your Social Security number, they can’t open new credit cards, loans, or accounts in your name if your credit is frozen.
* t doesn’t affect your current credit cards, loans, or your credit score.
* You can temporarily “thaw” your credit online in minutes if...</div>

There are companies that for years have close to no revenue, as they are trying to just increase the market size. Chatbots are actually an abnormality in the tech world where they collect revenue so early on in the timeline of a company.

A great example was twitter, that had no ads and no subscription at all for many years, while they had hundreds of millions of users.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Just started this week, went to a first class where we did bench press alternated with some running. It was easy enough, running and lifting are things I know quite well, thought "heh, CrossFit isn't that bad".

Went to my second class today, the WOD was Cindy. I read "5 pullups" thought "well that's easy enough again". Managed to get 12 rounds total (Rx) it was so fucking hard I thought I was gonna throw up.

Also my right bicep really hurts.

Can't wait to go back.</div>

However, while these changes aren't made, they could use tablets? Could this be more an example of "with our robots we can use any device currently in use, in any factory"
Also they are programming some prom/or veriifying a board - and for that - they physically use a single computer.</div>

Train people well. Sandbox the robot. Full control to human user to turn on or off - any complex task you basically turn on skylink and ask for help. Otherwise robot is autonomous for walking to places.</div>

Also, the reason why it looked like a horse was apparently  to "not frighten horses on the road". That could be true for humanoids in this case as well: "Hey, look, the robot is one of us. It's constantly distracted by its smartphone."</div>

It's like when Salvador decided to use crypto as a legal tender: lots of tech bros got excited but it was a terrible idea and the perfect way to do money laundering. The usual suspect doing it, of course.

Like Economics* hasn't been doing this since practically its inception. It's the non-biased decision making component of it they rely on famously to push their policies. Thatcher's "There Is No Alternative" comes to mind... AI tricks will just be another tool in the unfortunately large rhetorical bucket they already employ.

*it's not a totally useless field, but its got a lot of problems before its ready for prime time, and its almost always been taken over by different brands of snake oil salesmen who's chief goal has usually been pro-status quo embracing in one way or another.</div>
