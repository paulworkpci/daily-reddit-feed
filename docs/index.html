They, like everyone else in the frontier AI space, are shooting for AGI/ASI. Once that is achieved the cost to get there matters not.

Elon’s companies are at the frontier of AI, EVs, Space Travel, brain interface, autonomous driving, and autonomous robots. Of course private investors would like a piece of that, imagine the mind blowing scenario if all his companies actually achieve what they want and have synergy together. It’s basically the Singularity.</div>

It's very evident Elon is an unstable individual and investing in any of his companies is a straight up gamble since he's singlehandedly tanked Tesla's stocks. Who would honestly invest money in him. That has to be on the top of anyone's mind while looking at any of his companies as an investment.</div>

Okay but how were we supposed to know? And don’t bring up how he acted in his first term. Or on 1/6/21. Or his whole 2024 campaign. Or project 2025. Or all the warnings from the left.

Using this tech in work meetings, sales calls, interviews, etc is far more practical and less objectionable. But using it in the context of a date is controversial for obvious reasons -&gt; good engagement bait. Saw so many quote tweets blasting this and giving it more publicity

e: Somebody posted a tweet saying that dates arent actually a use case for the product so yep lol confirmed.</div>

Business meetings and such are the legitimate use case. However - the ad will get a bunch of people arguing about whether it should be used for a date.

Since we're discussing it now for exactly that reason, I'd say it's a pretty effective ad.</div>

Why?

	• A business owner / solo operator / entrepreneur has a killer idea.
	• They build a quick MVP and validate it.
	• Turns out—it actually works.
	• Money starts coming in.
	• Demand grows.
	• They now need full-time devs to scale while they focus on the business.

In the past, a ton of great ideas died in the graveyard of “I don’t have $10K–$100K to see if this eve...</div>

"Killer ideas" are worthless. Every random dipshit on the street has a dozen "killer ideas" bouncing around his head. What separates good startups from bad ones isn't the idea - it's the dedication of the people making it a reality, and a good bit of luck (and funding, if we're being really honest here). 

If I'm a dev, and a startup wants to hire me with a vibe-coded codebase, that tells me a few things: First, the management will in all likelihood be incompetent "business people" who have no idea what it means to do anything technical. Second, chances are that a "founder" that used LLMs to generate his codebase probably uses it like the oracle of Delphi -  every decision I make, and every informed opinion that I have will be second-guessed by a statistical word association machine. 

There is a place for vibecoding when you want to prototype rapidly, but that code can never see production - people who push AI-generated tosh into production almost always never understand it beyond "welp, this looks like it should works!" This is also an industry thing, but in my field pushing code you don't understand into production is at best irresponsible, borderline illegal.</div>

We are moving to a world where you are going to have extremely capable agents in all domains that will follow your directions to a T. This means putting together any feature you want, spinning up a large percentage of web app/ video game ideas that you might have, building them out in any way, shape or form that you wish, pursuing certain marketing strategies that you have in mind, generating content for ad campaigns, etc. Each and every person in a large percentage of countries will have access to things in this ballpark. And then the differentiating factor between people then becomes  what they decide to ask these agents to do - aka their ideas.

And as a caveat, of course you still have to follow through and iterate with the models by subsequently requesting new features and building out new things and improving on certain campaign ideas etc. So agency is definitely also important. The thing is though, acting on this agency is essentially a process of coming up with + requesting your ideas.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">All I hear in this post is "this is bad engineering" not that what the OP said wouldn't happen. You've likely seen or worked in a company with horrific engineering yourself at some point - that means jobs were still provided despite the horror show.

That's fine you won't apply to these jobs but there's plenty of engineers who would and I think the OP makes and interesting point. What I don't know is if the ratio of more efficient engineers using AI will counteract the number of startups that were able to get funding only due to vibe coding. I suspect it's not enough and this is all not a net gain.

Too many devs get hung up on good clean code, this post has 13 upvotes even. But startups are about traction, a vibe coded piece of shit that gets an investor interested in funding? 100x better than an ideas guy who never had the budget to hire a tech person to make a demo. Will that company ultimately succeed? Maybe, maybe not - but that's true of any startup really. Even before AI you have founders with zero business sense or no market so not sure that's new.</div>

Otherwise, vibe coding will just end up in super messy code that's not well optimized, not using good practices and is hardly scalable. Good thing is you can learn all that with AI too. But you need to do it. The dreamy idea of vibe coding the million dollar app will most possibly not work too well.</div>

Even if you hand code everything as soon as you change leadership the new CTO will tell you why they need to refactor. It’s always the same.

You never build an MVP for millions of users and you always discover things you would like to change.

A flaky MVP is fine. MVPs are always hack jobs and guesswork.

If you get scale then start over. You are going to have to anyway.</div>

Now I can see it wasn't just me imagining things, Claude indeed changes it's alignment based on the context.

As an example, one time I asked claude to translate religious propaganda from english, to old english (no context) Claude said that text could be harmful (true). I told Claude that text is a part of satiric comedy, gave it entire text, providing context.

Claude changed it's alignment to one better fitting for comedy, understood the satire, understood how change to old english is making the satire more obvious.</div>

The amount of people who already suffer from, or have  underlying undiagnosed mental health issues that AI is going to have a disastrous effects on is going to be huge.

I personally know people who have been commited to hospital due to AIs influence in 'yes anding' the wildest theories and 'philosophical' ideas/conspiracies. 

And having AI be so intertwined with techno-polical characters like Musk, Theil, Palantir etc.. Sure doesn't help.</div>

Cursor offers a very truncated version of Gemini with a small context, which may be in future updates even smaller looking at their continuous optimization of models. All this is to make the MAX version a good choice. In case you need a lot of functionality and knowledge of a larger range of code, the standard Gemini can't cope and you have to pay (also expensive) for MAX which will charge you a retribution for each use of the tool and you don't know how many times the tool will be used.

I saw a lot of differences in the quality of solutions spit out with code that had a total of one and a half million contexts, and the MAX version did much better because it just had that 1M context available, where the basic one made errors and does not take everything into account. 

You pay $20 for poor models that are suitable only for small functionality and code, and for better ones (MAX) you pay for each prompt + each use of the tool.

It comes out the same as using Roo/Cline</div>

LeCun's big achievement was convolutional networks. Great work, certainly.

                        <div class="comment-body">Obviously. Just that statement in and of itself is recursive.

We try to lean into logic because of its elegance, but we use it not to do the logical thing, but to do the thing that *feels* right, using data to justify illogical action.

Also, the analogical reasoning makes sense. We are a species of storytellers, because this was a very compact way to learn complex concepts quickly. I mean, how many times do you see scientists breaking down extremely mind-bending concepts using stories and analogies (Alice and Bob; the twins, where the older one becomes younger by traveling at the speed of light; etc.)? 

The problem is, this emotional form of thinking is a hindrance. Our OS is outdated; to borrow an analogy, it's like trying to run modern society on Windows 1.0.

So, yeah...we dumb.</div>

Allow thoughts in the background and put your breath and body in the foreground.

Trying to stop thoughts just gives your thoughts more power over you!

Find enjoyment in how you can soothe your nervous system by using your breath to soothe your heart.

Play around with longer exhales that’ll send waves of pleasure through your heart.

Get so engrossed in your breath and body that you stop having thought...</div>

Even if one isnt trying to stop thoughts, the usual instruction is to observe breath and if a thought happens and you notice yourself, gently bring focus back to breath. 

While this is good advice it sorta implies there’s no thought when observing breath when in fact thoughts can come n go but in the background while breath focus occupies the foreground.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yea.  I think the “bring attention back to the breath” is understood by intermediate and above meditators, but I think beginners think that having a thought means they aren’t doing it right and that they have to get away from thoughts.

Having thoughts in the background feels different to me as I don’t see having thoughts as meaning I’m not doing it right.  If I lose my focus on my breath, then I bring it back, but having thoughts in the background is fine.</div>

In my case I have to accept that parts of my focus stay at that intrusive thought and that my mind is not fully focused on breathing.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I used to think the whole point of meditation was to stop thinking completely, and it honestly made me feel like I was failing at it. I’d sit down, close my eyes, and then five seconds later my mind would be spinning with to-do lists, old memories, random stuff. I’d get frustrated and just give up thinking maybe meditation just wasn’t for me. It wasn’t until someone told me it’s not about stopping thoughts, but just noticing them, that things actually started to shift for me.

Now I treat it more like watching cars pass on a street. I sit, I breathe, and when thoughts come up, I try not to chase them or push them away, just see them and let them move on. Some days it works better than others, but letting go of the idea that my mind had to be totally blank made it way more calming. I still have a long way to go with it but it finally feels like something I can actually stick with.</div>

Just wanted to point out for others reading this: OP was talking about thoughts happening even \*while\* focussed on breathing and how it is totally normal as long as you are aware of them in the background while your foreground is one of your attention "resting" on breathing. This nuance is important.</div>

If it sounds kind of like a duck, doesn't walk or fly like a duck at all, and doesn't look anything like a duck, then there's a good chance it's not a duck. This is true even if someone creates their own "duck benchmark" and tells you that it's scoring very highly on it.

AI is nowhere close to the point where you'd say "hire some research assistants for this lab and train them what to do." The reason why we're relying on AI benchmarks is because AI still fails most real world scenarios. They're not even at the point where we're trying to test them with a simple errand list.

It's not just that LeCunn is right, but that even the people trying to say he's wrong will admit in other contexts that he's right. Do you think you'll trust Optimus to walk your dog, drive your car, go grocery shopping, and pick up your dry cleaning a year or two from now?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I can give you one reason- transformers struggle with state tracking. For example, if I give you a sequence of chess moves, determine the final state of the board. State tracking is also important in arithmetic and logical reasoning, because you have to keep track of intermediate results. Here's a paper showing how transformers can't generalize on arithmetic, logic puzzles, and dynamic programming problems 
https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18654

There are other sequence models that do better on this task, but struggle in different ways. I feel like we're running into a no free lunch problem...</div>
