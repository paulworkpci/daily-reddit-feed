This is pretty common in Canada too. I know someone like this and hearing them spew the mental gymnastics to come to the conclusion the dealer is giving them a good deal is pretty crazy.

A friend is a manager at a dealership as well and hearing the stories from them of people just walking in and asking to trade in with thousands owing still completely blows my mind.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Spike Jonze’s Her (2013) intentionally keeps the timeline vague, but based on clues from production design, dialogue, and technology depicted, the story is generally interpreted to take place in the mid-to-late 2020s or early 2030s.

Evidence:
	1.	Technology Level
	•	Advanced AI operating systems capable of forming complex emotional bonds, far beyond 2013’s capabilities.
	•	Minimalistic future tech: holographic gaming, fully voice-controlled OS, and paperless society.
	2.	Fashion and Environment
	•	The world isn’t drastically futuristic: buildings, trains, and city layouts resemble modern Los Angeles and Shanghai.
	•	Retro-futuristic fashion blends 1950s high-waisted pants and soft pastels, suggesting a near-future with timeless aesthetics.
	3.	Lack of Explicit Dates
	•	No on-screen text or dialogue mentions the year. This ambiguity was deliberate to make the film feel “just around the corner” and timeless.

Most film analysts and interviews with Spike Jonze place the setting about 10–20 years ahead of 2013, meaning somewhere around 2025–2035, but without a fixed timestamp.

Would you like me to give you a scene-by-scene timeline breakdown of the approximate time of day and days over which the movie takes place (based on visual cues)?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There was definitely a point during the 2024 campaigns, and early on at that, where it became crystal clear that letting Biden anywhere near a live mic was a recipe for disaster.


Trump is breezing past that point on the daily and appears to be leaving Biden in the dust as far as making catastrophically bad public statements.


Biden's oopsies were garden variety crippling senility on display. Alarming for sure but Trump is upping the ante to incorporate blatant senility with a large dash of self incrimination and stepping on rake after rake with what appears to be zero awareness of how much he's burying himself.


Dude is an imbecile beyond comprehension but we seem to have reached the stage where he no longer even has the capacity for self preservation.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;incentivized not to have children.

Literally the opposite of the message coming from the top. People are being urgently prodded to have more kids as they fan fears of underpopulation. By extension, tying your tubes is seen as literally evil outside of liberal circles.

Where in the world is anyone hearing to stop having kids?

That said, plenty of media is pushing back against UBI as a welfare queen's wet dream. Is that the part you meant? But when push comes to shove, is that message gonna matter when it's the only solution? Billionaires pushed for child labor. Despite some examples leaking through the cracks, how's that working out for them? I'm sure we can find more examples where billionaires don't really matter when it comes to masses of people affecting change in spite of them.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Well, I'm still looking for a tool.

For my complex large codebases I maintain for companies, Claude Code turned into hot garbage unfortunately for 80% of the day. This started some two weeks ago and I stopped my Max 20x plan.

Here in Europe in the early morning hours it did still work like its old self most of the time, but from then it is just creating frustration for me for the rest of the day. I have tested using the expensive Claude API at those times and got the same result unfortunately.

And no, I am not one of those 'power users', I have not once hit a limit or being throttled and I use Opus exclusively in Claude Code. I review every line written by it and I use it just for precise tasks surgically, not letting it run and ruin our carefully maintained codebases. 

I am now researching Roo Code with OpenAI/Gemini API calling.</div>

In the 1990s, the North Atlantic cod fishery collapsed. Everyone knew the fish stocks were dwindling, but each fishing company kept pushing harder, hoping to outcompete the rest and survive. Instead, the whole ecosystem and the industry with it died.

AI-driven layoffs feel eerily similar. Every company is racing to slash labor costs before competitors do. B...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'll take your argument a step further and argue that I think this is exactly why I believe UBI (or a similar social support) to be inevitable.

You don't have to rely on a single scrap of good will for us to throw ourselves into a situation where the government is forced to support the common people in some fashion, and I'd wager, in a pretty damn nice fashion at that.

[I'll give a recap here but here's my longer form argument. It's written much better over here than I will below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1lqu2e5/comment/n15mr7h/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) I address things like robots here in greater detail.

--------

AI corporations will continue to work on AI, and in order to justify their funding, they will release models the very second they are considered safe to be turned loose. For the sake of this argument, let's assume they do it - they succeed, and AGI is revealed. It does everything you could hope for and more, but it isn't quite a magical ASI.

If you are a business owner, especially in a field that is predominantly work that can be done behind a computer/"remote," you are going to soon start feeling the pressure to adopt this AGI-agent in order to remain competitive. If you're in a noncompetitive market, the siren song of MORE PROFIT WIDER MARGINS MORE PROFIT will get louder with every month that passes as more and more businesses report success with the new agent.

This, however, puts us in a dilemma. Any job that 'can' be automated will be automated, due to aforementioned competitive pressures.

...but (as I talk more about in my linked comment chain above), the ability to massively automate physical labor is still years away at best. Decades at worst. But you're laying off all your white collar workers RIGHT NOW.

White collar workers make up the majority of consumer spending; the top 2/5ths of households make up 2/3rds of consumer spending, and those households are predominantly white collar.

So, what does this leave us? Consumer spending is tanking, productivity should be either level (1:1 person to agent) or increasing (AI that is more efficient on a per-person basis).

This explodes the economy. There's no "waiting it out." If you are an oligarch and want to finish automating the economy, you NEED the economy to keep running long enough to replace everybody, but there will be years to decades of time where you can only replace some people while the other people MUST continue to work. No economy, means zero work, means everybody loses.

Okay. That won't happen, obviously. The government will step in, right? I think that's a fair assessment - just like during Covid (though that would be peanuts compared to this), it will suddenly be in the best interest of 'everybody' to redistribute wealth enough to prop up consumer spending. You can be maximally greedy and still arrive at this conclusion. **You cannot exploit an economy that does not exist.**

...which, here's the kicker. Once a system like this is in place, the dynamic changes. Suppose you're a politician - a greedy, soul sucking politician - the single easiest way to garner more votes from your base is to promise more UBI/social support. Unlike today, where you must skim off of the productivity of other humans...in this new world, you're skimming off the top of AI. AI that does not vote, needs only a fraction as many resources as people (on a unit basis, bear with me here), and won't firebomb your datacenters if it goes hungry.

Greedy AI companies opened the door. Greedy businesses painted themselves/the economy into a corner. Greedy politicians keep us well fed and furnished for their own gain after we've gotten out of the bind.

Furthermore, as the economy grows faster and faster as AI continues to improve, the percentage of the whole that is required to support humans grows at the speed of humans, not the speed of GPU forges. Pretty soon, the struggle necessary to reclaim the rapidly dwindling sliver of productivity required to let every human live in luxury is just not worth the squeeze. Why bother? It becomes more profitable every year to put what you 'would' have used to reclaim that sliver into just...making more productivity.

A positive outcome overall, I'd say. It will **absolutely not be perfect**, but it's a long way from being left out to starve. I'm okay with living in a world like this, I think. There's obviously a lot of fine details that could make it better or worse for people, but on the whole, "we need to redistribute enough wealth to make up for the automation of the top 2/5ths of household income and their consumer spending, also we have exploding productivity that we can skim off the top of, good luck!" seems fine to me?

Happy to debate/discuss. I had to truncate a lot of points to fit into a single comment, so, I know there's holes. I welcome you to read my linked chain above to get the longer story, especially if you want to chat about it.</div>

So expect massive disinformation campaigns to convince people to vote against such a thing.  Concocted crises, exploiting racial tensions, all sorts of FUD on how UBI will destroy everything.  How the people who can't find a job just need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.  Basically just all the republican talking points dialed up to 11.</div>

They made it all the way to a Capstone project and they're still trying to assign blame for the ills they're perceiving to inanimate technology products, individual companies, or specific business processes. If any of your guys have capacity I *definitely* think we could get this guy to realize that what he's really opposing, what his personal ideals really stand in defiance of, are the fundamental principles of labor exploitation and capital accumulation upon which global capitalism was founded and continues to rely."

\&gt; No matter how efficient a company is, it still needs people who can afford its products.

Too true. You know who doesn't actually give a flying fuck about that? The owners and executives of that company. They will see the end coming *long* before it crashes and by the time the lights go out they will have loaded their booty up into a bunch of nice tidy sacks so they can carry it with them to their next "business opportunity."

Let go of the idea that wealthy people care about whether or not a company has long term viability. If it does, that's fine for them - they certainly don't mind. It makes things a little more convenient. But if it doesn't, they absolutely *do not fucking care*. Some of the wealthiest people in the world got to where they are by jumping from one spectacular failure of a company to another. Because, again, despite what they will tell you, being an owner or executive of a company under capitalism doesn't actually come with any actual risk. If you fuck up and sink the ship you're on, a lifeboat will be right there waiting to ferry you to your next gamble.

Your problem is not with AI (or cod fishing surely). It is with the economic system under which these industries exist.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Interesting. A \*potential\* tragedy of the commons.  The dynamic nature of the 'commons' in this case accelerates the tragedy.

That said, it's not the only thing the race is doing. Other potential developments: economic abundance (post-scarcity economy), unprecedented scientific and medical progress, enhanced human life and creativity. 

How do you get abundance in a massive-unemployment scenario? By severing the link between labor and consumption: (1) collapse of production costs and (2) channeling added value through a universal dividend. Result: shared prosperity.

Balance it all out, and whether the future is utopian or dystopian is unknowable.</div>

I got a nasty letter from one of Musk's goons earlier this year, trying to claw back survivor benefits from an orphan in my care. Long story, but they wanted me (on his behalf) to "repay" several thousand dollars he had never actually received because DOGE dodos apparently struggle to follow a name change. Anyway, I called my congresswoman, her office got them off my back within a week. Though I did get another letter from the social security office telling me that it was inappropriate to involve my rep, and I should have dealt with them directly 🙄</div>

Eventually life becomes your greatest teacher, especially the relationships we hold will become a doorway of learning and understanding your own desires and attachments, convictions you are wrongly holding that bring disbalance in your life.

Then each experience you are having can be a moment to learn a lesson. From watching nature and seeing/hearing birds, to the busy streets of an inner city, social situation or the workplace, to loss of loved ones. Such a wonderful path this is where every moment can become a moment of growth!</div>

Your post content is a direct example of the statement in your post title, and you're right that it's valuable experience just to take in other peoples ways of thinking about and expressing things.

Pretty much everyone thinks they are right about a bunch of stuff that is maybe more realistically a matter of perspective, and that's easier to see when you actually take time to read other peoples perspectives.

That's what I got out of reading you post. Appreciate you taking the time to share.</div>
