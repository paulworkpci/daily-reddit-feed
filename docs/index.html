The melting point is higher based on the ratio of the salts you use.  

Ice pack melts at 0c over the course of an hour. 

A Salt based PCM can be mixed to melt at 15c over a course of 4 hours and you don't have to worry about freeze damaging tissue.

1: Claude 3.5 sonnet. OpenAI released several versions of 4o that couldn't catch up to sonnet for months before o1 dropped

2: Gemini 2.5 pro had a significant lead over o3-mini, and the o4-mini and o3 full releases are only catching up to / on par with 2.5 pro.

  
Remember, in 2022, no one was even close to openai. the rest of the industry was 6 months to 1 year behind.</div>

&gt;¬†Passed on a 40-8 vote,¬†House Bill 1596¬†would require certain drivers to install an "intelligent speed assistance" device that limits their car to the posted speed limit of the area they are in. Drivers with the device would be allowed to exceed the speed limit up to three times a month.


This ignores that the flow of traffic on highways not at rush hour is typically above the speed limit. It also ignores that sometimes momentary speeding is necessary for safety (e.g. a quick acceleration and lane change if a driver behind you is erratic). This needs some more polishing to not make these people just a different kind of hazard to everyone else on the road.</div>

Drivers with the device would be allowed to exceed the speed limit up to three times a month.

So what happens if someone wants to do a reasonable thing like pass a slow driver on a single-lane highway? If the posted speed limit is 60mph, and the person wants to pass someone going 58mph in front of them, they can't accelerate beyond 60mph if they've used up their 3 free passes? That's going to get someone killed.</div>

I have huge doubt that these devices will ever function correctly as it relies exclusively on GPS being correct literally 100% of the time, which is assanine. 

Not to get political, but this bill reminds me a lot of some of the gun laws that are passed to limit sales of firearms that are used in 0.2% of shootings. It's less about logic and more about feelings.</div>

That said I don't think limiting devices are in anyway sensible, and I'd love to know where this arbitrary "3 times a month" comes from. As it sort of tacitly admits speeding 3 times a month might be "OK"? I don't understand that part at all.</div>

The thing to do here is, train people on the road to be better drivers, as well, stop disregarding the 85th percentile and raise the arbitrary posted limit to what the flow of traffic is dictating.

It's the differential that causes the accidents. States and people with anxiety always want to blame speeders. However, the Solomon curve makes it abundantly clear,  it's the slowers who  cause far more traffic, accidents, and fatalities.

Fix the habitual slower problem and watch road safety and traffic dramatically improve.</div>

This is not a training or slightly too slow speed limit problem. It's a people being reckless assholes problem.

I think the better solution is just to limit the car to say, 70mph, but I'm all for devices that prevent morons like that guy from killing the rest of us.</div>

Since the gap between the full and mini version has been increasing from o1 and o3, as the computational gaps grow deeper. It makes me wonder what kind of beast o4 is, and I'm surprised nobody is talking about it. Like people clearly thinking that o4-full wouldn't be as big as step from o1-&gt;o3 and it would slow down, but this makes it seem like the opposite is true. Of course I'm not just thinking about this benchmark, if you look at the others they look a fair bit more comparable, but it still indicates what kind of beast o4-full must be.</div>

Google doesn't have to pay Azure Tax.

Google's core strength is Infrastructure Engineering. Google Search won, yes because of it's ranking algorithm, but what bought home the cake was their blazingly fast 100ms serving speed on **cheap** hardware.

If you think Google is burning cash to offer this price, you are mostly clueless about Google's culture.

What people don't understand is Jeff &amp; Sanjay are still kings and they still work for Google as Independent contributors

                        <div class="comment-body">Man how many tools that do the same thing do we need? Claude code is anthropic specific. Codex here is openai specific (i think?). Goose (from block/square) is llm agnostic. Then there's aider which is llm agnostic but less tool focused. These all work the same way.

Then there's the ui tools like roo/cursor/windsurf/copilot etc which are converging on the same product in terms of ux, model support, and tool use.

I'm happy for the pace of innovation but I secretly want to some of these to fail so development effort can be consolidated on fewer tools. I guess we're in the javascript frameworks phase.</div>

No? That's not how this works at all

Right now, best practices are still being figured out every day. Like a year ago everyone thought dumping your entire codebase into context was the best way to go. Before Aider's architect mode most LLM integrations were not giving you a seamless plan -&gt; implement workflow. Claude Code is very clearly better at agentic tasks than Aider, but that's only because it had Aider's work to build off of. The more products, the more polished tools will get. 

Please don't discourage open source work, AI is the field that needs it the most right now.</div>

He said something like *‚ÄùVisiting is not the ONLY way to learn but it is certainly the BEST way.‚Äù* That feels like such a load of shit.

Acquisitions are usually *not* about acquiring a company with a moat.

Sometimes they are, and sometimes you buy a company for a very similar reason (e.g. securing their IP). But the vast majority of the time, acquisitions are done to achieve much simpler synergies (e.g. both companies benefit from more direct assets to each other's customers) and efficiencies (e.g. by merging the companies, you can reduce duplicated headcount, saving money). Sometimes they are also done simply because the larger company wants to grow and doesn't have the patience to do it organically.

The reasons for this is quite simple ‚Äî firstly, companies with a strong moat tend to be much more expensive because the founders are much more protective of their equity and unwilling to dilute it, and secondly, companies with a strong moat are just rare, anyway. So the majority of M&amp;A tends to occur with companies without a particularly strong moat.</div>

The beijing half-marathon where humanoids were supposed to compete on the 15th was [postponed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/worlds-first-humanoid-robot-half-marathon-postponed-due-windy-weather-2025-04-10/#:~:text=The%202025%20Beijing%20Yizhuang%20Half,Thursday%20by%20the%20event's%20organizers) to the 19th because of the weather.

If that version of the G1 is the one they'll use with that speed, then they have a very good chance at winning.  
That's not 100% sure though, the PM01 from engineAI is pretty damn fast as well.

That's assuming both companies will participate and that their humanoids can handle that kind of speed for a sustained period of time without having their actuators overheat too much. It looks like they are really maxing out their hardware.</div>
