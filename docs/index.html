So yes you can do anything, [here's an early example](https://www.reddit.com/r/SyntheticAesthetic/comments/1gyhtrp/big_pussies_playing/) of my output from a single prompt, and I've got it way more stable now (by generating a point cloud instead of a displaced plane from the depth map in blender).</div>

At the start of the day, I carefully list my top priorities, thinking *today will be different*.

                        <div class="comment-body">I do now, as of 6 months ago. I started calendar blocking and using my calendar as a to do list. It’s not an understatement to say it’s been life changing in my happiness, creativity, pushing projects forward, productivity, leadership at work, and general stress levels. Here are the pillars of the system:

-Use your calendar as a task list by scheduling new requests, projects, or to do items as they arise. Assign them a specific date and time block, whether it’s tomorrow, two weeks from now, or six months down the line. 

-Overestimate the time needed for a task. Sometimes I double the estimated time, especially if it’s a sensitive task that requires focus and nuance, or a creative project. 

-No item may have less than a 30 minute block. Even if you think it’s a task that will take 2 minutes, it has to occupy a 30 minute block. 

-Meetings are one color on the calendar and “to do” items are another. 

-No double booking any tasks or meetings. 

-After every meeting, block 30 or 60 minutes for “post processing.” This allows you to close the loop on takeaways from the meeting, and schedule out any to-do items that may have come up as a result of the meeting. This keeps things from bottlenecking and forgetting to revisit what was important about the meeting. 

-Schedule recurring blocks for checking emails, important projects, and task list items that need to be worked on but you usually avoid or push out. 

-Schedule deep work and complex tasks during your peak performance hours. Mine is morning so deep think tasks go there, and meetings that require less mental energy go in the afternoons for me. 

-On Fridays, review the next week and ensure it’s all blocked in a way that looks like a good pace to you. 

At first, it’s shocking how little you feel like you can get done in a day. But pretty quickly, as you start feeling more productive with what you do accomplish over time, the days feel more calm and satisfying, and less stressed about the tasks piling up (since you’re scheduling them out instead of cramming them in), it becomes surprisingly easy (and almost fun) to stick with.

Of course emergencies pop up and unforeseen tasks that have to be addressed right away— that’s normal. You fit those in and move things around in your calendar, still maintaining the no double booking rule. This system has allowed me to stop seeing every task that pops up as a priority or urgent. Some are, but most aren’t. 

This system builds in margin and working at a more natural human pace, vs frustrated manic whack-a-mole to do list burnt out robot. I was the latter for the last several decades. This system (plus setting up better habits and filters around email) have made a huge difference. And I’ve never been so consistent and productive with major projects and tasks, and infusing more creativity into my job, which was lacking before. 

A long answer, but I hope it’s helpful. I just wrote a presentation on digital organization and calendar/task management a few months ago and have been delivering it to groups lately, so it’s all fresh on the mind :)</div>

Sunsama seems like it would be good for this.

                        <div class="comment-body">Your to-do list isn’t the problem, it’s how your brain interacts with it.

The issue isn’t discipline or willpower. It’s that traditional to-do lists don’t account for real-life variables like shifting priorities, decision fatigue, or how motivation fluctuates throughout the day. The trick isn’t finding the perfect system, but adapting your approach to work with how you naturally operate.

Plan your list where you’ll do the tasks, not just what they are. Instead of writing down a vague "do research" or "write email," attach it to a specific trigger. Instead of "write proposal," say "write the first draft while having coffee at 9 AM." Instead of "read articles," say "read for 20 min after lunch." This takes the guesswork out of when and where, so you don’t rely on motivation alone.

Limit your list to three real priorities, then create a done list. Most people overload their lists, setting themselves up for failure. Start with three non-negotiable tasks and track what you actually do in a separate done list. This flips your mindset from focusing on what you missed to seeing what you accomplished.

Tackle resistance with a starter step. If you avoid big tasks, break them down to the easiest possible action. Instead of "sort out finances," start with "open the spreadsheet." Momentum beats motivation every time.

Use your energy, not just your clock. Traditional productivity advice tells you to schedule everything, but your energy levels fluctuate. High energy is for creative or complex work. Low energy is for admin tasks or passive learning. Midday slump is when you should take a break instead of fighting it.

Treat your to-do list like a menu, not a contract. Some days don’t go as planned, and that’s fine. Instead of seeing your list as a rigid schedule, treat it like a menu of choices you can pick from based on what’s realistic.

If your to-do list keeps failing, the problem isn’t that you’re undisciplined, it’s that most systems are designed for an ideal world, not real life. Adjust your approach to match how you actually work, and you’ll stop rolling tasks over every day. What’s the biggest struggle you have when sticking to your list?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">People hate you.

People hate where you are from.

Some people will try to hurt you, get you fired, ostracize you or even worse. 

Read Victor Frankyl, a psychiatrist who survived being hated and what he said about how to not get depressed when you live in a world that hates you. It changed my life.</div>

You just need to stop looking. Easier said than done, I know. but now that you know “hey, going down these rabbit holes doesn’t make me feel good” try to think about that when you catch yourself.</div>

Bombshell memo claims JFK probed CIA to release UFO files 10 days before his assassination

[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14481929/memo-JFK-probed-CIA-release-UFO-files-assassination.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14481929/memo-JFK-probed-CIA-release-UFO-files-assassination.html)

As the John F Kennedy assassination files are set to be released to the public, a memo supposedly written by the former president 10 days before his death has resurfaced.

In the letter, dated November 12, 1963, JFK allegedly requested the director of CIA brief him about 'all UFO intelligence.' The recipient's name was redacted, but John McCone headed the department at the time.

It stressed the importance of knowing what objects in the skies are unknown in the event the Soviets mistake a UFO as America spying on its defenses.

The story goes like this: MM was a huge liability, not only for what she planned to expose about JFK / RFK but also regarding UFOs and The Bay Of Pigs. This was confirmed in a document that was uncovered at some point (1990s?). I’ve seen images of this memo but I can’t begin to vouch for the authenticity or provenance.

Israel genuinely, realistically has some sort of creepy fucking all powerful command of all American media and it's politicians, on both sides. It's not even a conspiracy.

And by the time they realize it was basically just a Used Car Salesman tactic and they want to vote him out? Too late; he's already defied the courts and suspended elections. And when they take to the streets? He has control of the Military and National Guard.

They voted the fox right into the hen house. He's not ever going to leave and he's doing to do whatever the fuck he wants from this point on, until he either decides to retire and appoint an heir, or dies.

We had our chance to avoid this, but a slightly larger margin of my fellow Americans are the dumbest fucking creatures to ever walk the planet earth.</div>

My productivity goes up, like no more brain fog, in the morning its just overwhelming to do anything, I can't focus on anything, but at night I can put my mind to anything and complete it.

My reaction time improves, I can talk and think faster, in the morning I can't make a 'tch tch tch' sound very fast but I can do it at night.

I recently ended things with a girl, I literally don't feel anything towards her...</div>

It's normal to feel differently and have different emotional and mental orientations at different times of day but the changes you're describing sound like they really interfere with your life, and for that reason I'd definitely talk to a doctor or psychiatrist. It sounds like it could be hormonally driven.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think you have answered your own question at the end. You are too overstimulated during the day and find it difficult to stick to a routine. At night you are less distracted and can focus more, which includes emotional regulation. I had this for a bit and what helped me was having a set morning routine with mindfulness meditation.</div>

It shows how much we still don't know. And I think it's good to acknowledge that. While on the other hand, you get redditors claiming left and right, that they somehow cracked the mystery and these things are just data and it is impossible for them to be intelligent or reason about something.

                                <div class="reply-body">This is because the leading figures in this field have never thought about such topics at length. They are CEOs/researchers, not philosophers, and this is evident from takes such as the one expressed in the OP — where the person is implying that feelings like "pleasantness" can somehow be implicitly correlated with intelligence, rather than being an explicitly set variable state that is influenced by and influences various other variable states within the internal system of the agent.

For example: Event XYZ triggers an increase of +10 in the variable "sadness", which in turn influences other variable states, and all subsequent thoughts/actions of the agent (because they are influenced by the value of that variable).

An agent is not going to magically start feeling "pleasant" or "sad" unless those feelings are explicitly programmed into it.

Also, keep in mind that I am not even talking about subjective experience / qualia in this comment! I am talking about merely *"event XYZ detected, beep boop, increment var sadness by 10. var sadness = 53 🤖"*</div>

Ok... but why is it that everyone on that side of this puzzle never asks "how could it?" why is the onus always "why could it not"?

I could do that all day, I could say one day teleporters might exist, and you cannot prove me wrong.  But if I said God exists, using this same logic and the same 
 quality of evidence, you'd argue until the sun sets...

Pick and choose, it's what we do, we are skeptical and dismissive with things we do not like and all in for that which we do.

That said...

Biological brains are based on cells, chemicals and electricity. They are a completely different structure and engagement. Yes, it is still a mystery, this does not mean the mystery persists across everything else.

“ Designing robust reward structures that do not inadvertently incentivize unwanted behavior is remarkably hard, and it isn’t a problem limited to human institutions; it’s also one of the core challenges in developing capable, aligned AI systems”

“
It’s common for frontier reasoning models to very clearly state their intent within their chain-of-thought. For example, they are often so forthright about their plan to subvert a task they think “Let’s hack”.
We can monitor their thinking with another LLM and effectively flag misbehavior.
Their natural monitorability is very fragile. If strong supervision is directly applied to the chain-of-thought, models can learn to hide their intent while continuing to misbehave.”</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s this one. I had AI help me write a program that included training an AI model on images, and eventually I got to a solution that’s like 75% effective. I know what I want it to do, I’ve been able to get improvements with each iteration of my prompts, but I’m certain the code it came up with is “clunky” and not the most appropriate method for what I’m trying to accomplish. Having people who know what is available and how to relate it to the use case improves the output of what AI is writing, and they can go in and manually tweak whatever is needed using experience rather than approximation.</div>

I, for one, will be tuning in to this report w/ 60 Minutes on Sunday. As you may know, alongside with investigations w/ Enigma as well as many other groups scratching their heads - we see no slowing down of reports from citizens GLOBALLY of these drones flying silently over residential neighborhoods as well as sensitive military installations. This must be addressed officially, and so far here in 2025 we've had no clarity offered by the administration or the FAA regarding these drones. You better believe this is a subject worth following. Something hasn't been sitting right with this one. What do you think is happening?

                                <div class="reply-body">I have worked in the commercial drone industry.  Every drone needs a remote ID that directly reports to the FAA what the drone is, the manufacturer and what it is capable of doing, height, speed and who it belongs to.  You can't fly over large cities like for instance, Denver, without permission (there are specific places where you train with drones and its not over large urban centers..think small airports, military places, RC flying grounds) and if it was a mistake, it wouldn't be happening night after night for months now.  I've been watching them over Denver and Boulder and beyond, every single night for 3 months now.   They've flown directly over me a half dozen times and Ive counted upwards of 50.  Some are stationary.  Most often they are silent.  Sometimes they sounds like a small cessna.  Sometimes it holds a bright white light flying over residential.  Sometimes lights blink-red, white, green.  Sometimes they leave off a spray that doesn't break up like vapor. Sometimes there's a bright white stationary light they seem to gravitate toward, typically in the western sky.  For the first time last night, I saw two flying together, not fixed wing, bright red lights.  I would say the ones that aren't fixed wing are quads, but they're not.  Odd.  Just to be clear, I'm well aware of what an airplane looks like and that DIA is due East.  These are not planes.  Not at all.  I have my theories.  I have seen other things in the sky that defy all reason but since I don't know, I remain an observer.</div>

This all started in the UK, which wasn't really reported on and was pretty much forgotten about once the NJ sightings started.  Then the US elections happened - the administration changed, and this was all but forgotten about amid the rest of the chaos. 

Then we get this lame statement from the dolt press secretary saying these were all simply approved FAA drones with a dumb look on her face.  Really?  No one in the military, FBI, local PDs, etc. seemed to have been told  this, and airports were being shut down... but this was the answer?</div>

I have caught myself several times squinting or otherwise trying to decipher the next line down rather than just saying "I can't read that one without squinting."

I'm so used to trying to make things clearer (or maybe subconsciously trying to "pass" the test)...</div>
