**I mean, you still can use it for multiple huge agentic tasks, SET THEM TO RUN WHILE YOU SLEEP, then use paid models to debug the results, and you’ll end up SAVING TONS OF MONEY.**

Now, the rate limits might be a problem. **HOWEVER,** I keep seeing lots of messages in various subs that automatically dismiss the value of free endpoints without offering any actual insight whenever someone mentions them as an option. You know, messages like, *“Testing right now. Slow. Bad.”* or *“I just tested, it’s garbage.”*

These comments strangely claim to be based on actual testing, yet are posted just five minutes (or less) after someone brings up the topic.

**ANYWAY, I'M NOT ACCUSING YOU OF ANYTHING,** of course... but could you please further illuminate us with your findings about this specific free endpoint?

When you mention rate limits, were you talking about fluctuations in throughput, or a full denial of service? Did you test this endpoint using a smart orchestrator capable of retrying the connection and continuing from where it was halted? Because, you know, even free endpoints with rate limits (which, by the way, even paid services have) can be milked like a cow if you know what you’re doing.

**So please, share your technical knowledge with us.**</div>

**Just to mention, any Chutes endpoint openly uses your data for training. Other companies pay them to improve or fine-tune models. They need users pumping in data and stressing the system through everyday use, which is why they offer the free endpoint.**

**BEFORE YOU RUN AWAY WITHOUT GIVING IT A CHANCE,** remember that lots of paid AI models use your data for training too. Some of them admit it, and I suspect some of them just lie about it. Anyway, you can be sure all your personal data is already registered in huge databases just from your social media usage, and you probably didn’t care about that. If you’re not developing something like a national security hacking system, they really don’t care specifically about you. Also, you’re using the AI model to generate code for you. What code are they going to steal from you? Your app to space out the time between your bathroom breaks? They’ll use your data to standardize code, to see which AI-generated solutions stick more for a specific issue, and to evaluate how users interact with AI in order to make responses feel more satisfying.

The only thing you really need to be careful about is not giving out personal data like your name, ID number, address, emails, credit card info, or API keys from other services. But hey, that’s the least you can expect from anyone using AI.</div>

The whole reason it's called "fuck you" money is that you can withstand attacks from anyone, even powerful figures like the president. And yet they're capitulating anyway, because they want a little bit more money.

If you're capitulating to get a little more money, your "fuck you" money is just "yes, Daddy" money.</div>

I mean they spend billions a year on Azure gov.  200 million for grok could be “up to 200 mil for the year” or “private instance of grok pro / elite” whatever they call the versions for like X users for the year.

Or maybe it’s a theee letter giving them a contract for time on their GPU cluster (when Collusus 2 is live, that 200 million is for time on collusus 1, and airgapped to only us and none of your shit or software on it, and a proper physical examination for passive taps)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That’s deceptive. The government gave ALL the top AI companies a ceiling contract for $200m. 

A ceiling contract doesn’t award any actual $$ or contracts. It just makes it much easier for government agencies to award new contracts to companies with a ceiling contract.

So, it’s easy enough for Trump to still ban awarding contracts to xAI.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I also give the same advice when it comes to warm air hand dryers in public bathrooms. If you can see the air inlet, it’s taking the air directly from the immediate bathroom environment, heating it up &amp; then blowing it directly onto your lovely clean hands. These hand driers are known to actively increase bacterial contamination if used.

Luckily these are all but non-existent these days, bar the odd very old premises. The new variants of hand drier these days will almost always have an exterior inlet which pulls fresh air from outside. But still…stay vigilant out there!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt; Despite the shared components, Honda engineers said they have applied model-specific tuning to both the suspension and brakes. This is to ensure that the Prelude stays true to its role as **a grand tourer, prioritizing comfort and balanced dynamics over track-day aggression.**

This seems to confirm that Honda isn’t aiming this towards sport cars enthusiasts but rather for people who want a comfortable daily driver type of coupe.</div>

We all pretend to be happy to work.

Open Model coming before GPT-5:
"I’m still hearing that this open language model is imminent and that OpenAI is trying to ship it before the end of July — ahead of GPT-5’s release. Sources describe the model as “similar to o3 mini,” complete with reasoning capabilities."

GPT-5, GPT-5-mini and GPT-5-nano:
"I understand OpenAI is planning to launch GPT-5 in early August, complete with mini and nano versions that will also be available through its API.... I understand that the main combined reasoning version of GPT-5 will be available through ChatGPT and OpenAI’s API, and the mini version will also be available on ChatGPT and the API. The nano version of GPT-5 is expected to only be available through the API."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Although I appreciate open source developments, one other issue with the open model will of course be parameter count. If it's similar to o3 mini, but still a 100B+ model, many people, myself included, are not going to be able to run it at any (reasonable) quantization, effectively turning into an "ah neat and then move on" moment (and if I'm going to use an API service with terms/privacy conditions, I might as well use OpenAI's closed source GPT-5).

                                <div class="reply-body">Yup, this is a very common architectural direction being used for new agentic systems. Multiple agents with different prompts, different tool access, and sometimes using different models, cooperate within the system to achieve the overarching task. So some agents may break the task down and send the subtasks to new agents, some agents may execute the tasks (sometimes different agents for different types of tasks), and some agents may review the output of other agents to ensure they meet given standards. It's pretty cool stuff.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">At a minimum, both hemispheres of the brain are actually their own brains. This is known and has been for a long, long time.

One of the procedures to treat severe epilepsy involves severing the corpus collosum -- the bit that connects the two hemispheres of the brain. [This induces the split-brain syndrome.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain) The two sides cannot communicate easily anymore, leading to problems processing information when both sides aren't experiencing the same thing at the same time (such as with one eye covered or a hand doing something out of view of the eyes). 

However, notably, despite not knowing what's up, the hemisphere without experience will create post-hoc justifications as if it knew all along what it was doing -- which can lead to some absolutely nonsense justifications as the one hemisphere tries to tie its experience in with the other hemisphere's. This might seem familiar to you as an AI fan because LLMs do this too.</div>

 - if answer is yes - its still Epstein socializing with underage girls

 - if answer is no - he did not deny that he himself socialized with underage girls thus indirect admition that he did.

 - lawyers' rhetorical tricks. - even though here they are asking him about Trump, their main target here is still Jeffrey Epstein.</div>

I've been reading a lot about how meditation helps with trauma healing—and I genuinely want it to work for me. But sometimes it just makes everything louder. Sharing honestly here, wondering if anyone else feels the same.  
  
I know meditation is supposed to help. I’ve read the articles, watched the videos, heard the advice a hundred times. But here's the truth—when your entire brain is soaked in trauma, when every quiet moment becomes a battlefield filled with flashbacks, self-blame, or anx...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">One important piece of this is that meditation doesn’t mean being calm. Like maybe someday it will, but it’s like going to the gym for a while and expecting to run a marathon. The present hurts, and trauma influences the things that come up, but the goal isn’t to stop that. It’s slowly, slowly to get a bit of distance from it. Trauma means certain scripts run all the time and those include body habits but over time meditation means at the beginning of the script you can start to say oh hey, there’s that script… that’s not a fact, that’s just a thought thinking itself. It’s not even my idea, I don’t have to believe it, or climb into the stream. You practice a thought and an emotion coming up and just letting it pop up without becoming the thinking road you head down, and slowly you start to get the skill of always noticing the second before you’re treating some nonsense your brain spit out on its own like it’s something true or something you believe or ruminating on it etc. So at the end of a session you might not be calmed, but you’re a little stronger in noticing the second before you’re already treating the thought or the emotion like it’s You and getting totally engaged in it.</div>

This is the path to a deeper longer lasting peace even if it takes time - to observe (and later, accept) the bad and the good, for a more equivalent state of mind.

Sure the net is full of physiological hacks for calming that is passed off as meditation (deep breathing etc) and they may even work but only temporarily.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I used to find it extremely difficult, but now it feels like a safe space for me.

It takes time and practice to feel at ease with the quiet, but it is absolutely worth it. 
For years, I relied on distractions and addictions to cope with the symptoms of trauma, PTSD, and CPTSD.

The best advice I can offer is to keep practicing embracing the quiet. When emotions come up, take deep breaths and allow yourself to cry, anger, grieve. Whatever you're feeling. 

I know that is much easier said than done, but letting yourself feel is powerful. Emotions come in waves, and when we allow them to move through us, we create space for healing.

Our brains actually release a comforting chemical after we cry, and it can feel like a real sense of relief.

Also, if meditation feels too hard to focus on, that is completely okay. What matters most is learning to feel safe in your body, to regulate your emotions, and to treat yourself with love and compassion &lt;3</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">what has helped me most in that area is daoist purification practices. Basically the aim is to tune in to those physical tensions/bracing of the body and release them. This bypasses the emotional and mental side of things and works to release trauma using the physical body as the initiator of release. There's more detail on the overall process here [https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueQiGong/comments/1gna86r/qinei\_gong\_from\_a\_more\_mentalemotional\_healing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueQiGong/comments/1gna86r/qinei_gong_from_a_more_mentalemotional_healing/)

As well as that when i couldn't do that/had done enough in a session, nature walks have been helpful, or just long walks in general. Also 'comfort tv' - watching old favorites, music, comedy &amp; games have given a breather between sessions.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This. For meditation there are a lot of preparations. If you jump right into meditation without preparations it will be more difficult and probably less sustainable. Breath-work, trauma release and meditation go hand in hand in my personal experience.

Going into meditation without preparation is like having ice cold buckets of water splashed on you when ur sitting warm and cozy. Ur mind is going to resist meditation without preparation. Yogic limbs know this and each limb prepares you for intense meditation</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Ive been around alot alot alot of these athletes. The vast majority are just absolutely INSANE in the food/eating department. Im sure there are some exceptions, but speaking in broad strokes. They all eat so healthy 99% of the time and when they 'pig out' its so different than any of my regular friends. They do not drink a lot and when they do its so stereotypical, Liquor and Soad water vs beer/ mixed drinks. 1-2 at most never the 8-10 normies drink lol 

You can train for 4 hours a day every day, but if you dont eat right it will never matter.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">i agree with you from my experience. similar to sport performance itself, nutrition (for sports) becomes a bigger time investment, the further up in the leaderboards. So for nutrition the spectrum goes from a) not eating like a\*hole, to b) fuel for performance like a pro. And the majority is happy with a) what is sufficient to be and feel healthy but doesn't mean you turned into Aimee Cringle. Realistic is somewhere between a) and b).

The thing about the "look" that people will adapt their body into whatever is needed for the physical activity (given genetic constraints or preconditions). If people look more jacked like the norm, the question "is that achievable" is kind of answered: maybe but at low probability.

Absolutely.</div>

&gt;Maybe. Probably not.

I dont agree with this because the full time work goes into not only looking like that but also performing in strength AND cardio for a Crossfitter. 

Look how much more insane female bodybuilder influencers look, even the ones claiming natural. THOSE are people paid to LOOK good.

Just LOOKING like that is like 50-70% as hard. Your diet needs to be every bit as good as them for body composition, but your training needs to be just bodybuilding.

I am factoring here that many of these pictures these women have ideal pumps and walk around traditionally looking mildly fluffier.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">GPT-7 would automatically be more effective than most politicians at the actual job. It processes massive amounts of information instantly, applies consistent logic, and isn’t driven by money, re-election, or public image. 

Human politicians, on the other hand, spend years pushing pointless laws that actively harm millions of people, then leave others to waste even more time and resources cleaning up the mess. Their decisions are based on vibes, polling, and pleasing donors, not outcomes. They lie, stall, and serve power. 

The only reason they’re still in charge is because people are conditioned to trust a familiar face, no matter how useless it is.</div>

Open AI will at some point automate their AI research once it reaches that level. Running the company itself is also a stated goal of Nvidia's last I checked too.   
  
Now given how the U.S. electorate is... should GPT-7 turn out to be ASI, I'd hardly mind it becoming a "shadow' president in the background.</div>
