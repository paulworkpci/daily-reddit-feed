While it’s true that the U.S., for example, won’t even give its citizens basic medical coverage, it’s not true that the government won’t step in when the economy tanks. When a recession hits (2008, 2020… sort of), the wealthy push for the government to inject capital back into the system to restart things.

Many economic systems existed before it. Many will exist after it. Capitalism was useful as was Mercantilism, Feudalism, and many others before it. 

Imagine, if you will, an economy built around sustainability and resource depletion mitigation. Some goods would become more scarce but the bulk of goods deflate YoY in prices due to sustainable energy maximization. This is just one of many possible future models.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I work extensively in developing nations with low income farmers.

A subset of the world's poor will probably be OK, they are naturally industrious by necessity, used to hardship and in the rural areas they don't depend on money, government, services a lot as of now anyway.   I can see agrarian community level groups doing no worse, or perhaps even better than now (still plenty of heath and education issues etc. but at least they can eat.)  Marginal areas will be tricky, as will areas that have taken a one way path to monocrops. 

The worst hit areas will be the lower income urban areas where, as you say, the government has no capacity for UBI, those that provide substantial lower value outsourced services (sales, helpdesk, IT maintenance) abroad will be devastated, because the change will come too fast to adapt and it is too big an economic hole to fill.

Those areas are where riots are easily triggered - like in Jakarta now - and most of those governments will use excessive force which will inevitably escalate the riots and use of force, I do not see any path to a positive outcome.

It is a genuinely terrifying situation to consider.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Even from the first world, I find it rather naïve. 

Democracy (where all get a tiny bit of political power and can use that to further their interests) is a very recent thing. It's only from around first to second world wars that universal suffrage became a thing. 

Before that it was commonly by property ownership. One needed economic power to be allowed voting rights. 

It is when economic power is frustrated, that most revolutions happen. Large part of why the French revolution happened was the new economically powerful bourgeois group was completely denied any political power under the ancien regime.

So in the future, political power (and the use of it for redistribution) will follow economic power. There will be no benevolent for the masses UBI scheme, at most some bread and circuses to keep them placated.</div>

Today, 10% of the US population makes up 50% of all money spending.

Do you see the government cutting out checks to even things out? No, cuz the rich is propping up the economy just fine.

Basically, most of the US population is redundant and unnecessary for the economy. When AI really ramps up and that same top 10% makes up 80%+ of all money spending instead, it will transition just fine.

The goal of UBI is basically give the bare minimum so the poors don't revolt. We are talking food stamps type things, where you get easily rejected for filling out the paperwork wrong.</div>

Now we know she would have survived two terms and been more mentally competent than either Trump or Biden in 2025. 

I still would vote against her like I did at the time (I refused to back *any* dear friend of Epstein's), but it's important to remember just how blatant the media is with it's right wing favoritism. Same way you never hear the media remind people that James Comey publicly opened an impotent investigation into Hillary just days before the election.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Wow, you have reached a deep level of awareness. Good good!

Would recommend that you observe and perceive a Structure when in that state of mind... Instead of asking, who is talking (self talk, I presume), who is observing and who is listening... Understand that "there is a listener, there is an observer and there is some entity talking..."

Keep observing further with equanimity ... Without drifting into a sense of achievement and celebration... Understand these perceived phenomenons deeper... What is their nature??? How do they respond to stimuli when not meditating...

Keep going deeper and this understanding, this knowledge, this 'Pradnya' will help you in real life, day to day activities as well.

That inner voice speaking can become your personal AI inside you, guiding you if you learn to understand it... properly...

Good progress and keep it up... 🙏🏻😊🙏🏻</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It’s unfortunate that people focus too much on the body weight numbers instead of composition.

Ie, a 200lb person with lots of fat who converts 10lb of fat into muscle via is healthier but still weighs the same. 

“Oh I’m still 200lb after all that exercise. I’ll just quit bc there’s no point”. It’s very sad</div>

1. If the patient does not give all of the info, AI is sometimes less likely to ask the right questions. With the right training this could easily be flipped around, where AI will take the time to ask questions a doctor won't ask.
2. Patients sometimes simply does not listen to the AI even when the right advice is given. Maybe with the right RLHF, the AI could be more convincing.

I think if you fix these 2 things, AI could be a really good first line. It could order non-invasive tests when it seems appropriate, give lifestyle advices, and refer to a real doc when needed.</div>

Doctors barely asked anything at all, and didnt bother listening to 95% of things i did tell them. Shitton of antibiotics was enough anyway, so it wasnt a problem this time, but in general this issue is a far wider problem than anything to do with AI. Its a combination of social problem and entrenched conventions of the professional field, both of which are extremely hard to change even among humans. Solving these problems or facing new related ones using AI is gonna be an uphill battle either way, given how deep they are just within purely human space.</div>

1. If the patient does not give all of the info, doctors are sometimes less likely to ask the right questions. With the right training this could easily be flipped around, where better trained doctors will take the time to ask questions a regular doctor won't ask.
2. Patients sometimes simply does not listen to the doctors even when the right advice is given. Maybe with the right training, the doctors could be more convincing.</div>

Abridge is essentitally AI note taking. so it's amost a hybrid model of human on the front line with an AI backup which does a much better job at the note taking - as well as offering solution which may not have been caught, and summarizing. Then the in-person relationship is stronger with the physician as they are then full attention on the patient and the interaction.</div>

I asked ChatGPT what it noticed, it said my son's birthday was wrong. Sure enough they included his full name and birthday in the filename and it had him 7 years younger. I brought it up - said I noticed it while looking at the screen - and they fixed it. 

ChatGPT didn't know my son's exact birthday but I did say the X-rays were of my 15 year old son.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If u look you can see a bit on an exodus of users from CC to codex - same on twitter - I believe the growing consensus is that GPT-5 is now a better all round model than sonnet/opus (just some people haven't updated yet). This is recent shift, only happening in the last week or so. But safe to say the kind has been dethroned (though if you say this on this sub you get accused of being a bot).

Some pros and cons but generally thought the limits (currently) are more generous with openai, while CC has better tooling than codex. I find I don't really need the extra tooling with codex, so I can live with it (and codex tooling improving rapidly).

the other thing about codex, which might be a plus or minus depending on your POV, is that it has no personality. it's really boring (though maybe you can push it with custom instructions). claude has a lot of personality. but that also comes with it being a lying, sneaky b\*\*\*\*\*d..</div>

Sounds like Michelin are caught in between a rock and a hard place. Love the Cup 2s though; have been running them for years now and haven’t found anything better for my use cases. Great on track but pretty easy to live with daily.</div>

This phenomenon can be seen across the entire world. When Third World countries limit immigration or deport Millions its cool.

 I’ve been applying for jobs in the EU for 3 years and not once have I had a single interview. I even applied for a PhD position in France and got rejected because of “not sufficient recommendation.”

Every time I apply for a Schengen visa, I’m buried in endless bureaucracy and useless paperwork.

Meanwhile, all the thugs and lowlives I know from my town are in France and Germany illegally, living off government expenses without even working.

This is why Europe is fucked, they reject and make the process impossible for legal skilled immigrants, but open their doors and spread their legs for the scum of the earth then complain about how fucked up their countries are becoming.</div>

It's by design. Make its so difficult to do legally that it only leaves the illegal option available.  These people are the easiest to exploit. 

In the meantime the media  paint the picture they are all here on benefits, which is partially true, as they end up doing both, taking jobs from the working class and tax money as well.

My brother Ben has a rare neurological condition that left him quadriplegic and nonverbal. For years, most of the assistive tech out there didn’t really fit his needs. The phrase boards were uninspired, the keyboards were clunky, and honestly he didn’t enjoy using them. He mostly stuck with yes/no answers.

When he got covid in 2020 he only spent 3 days in Walter Reed and still was posting videos, dipped out one day to do a little impromptu motorcade parade and as soon as he discharged made a big show of taking off his mask and trying to look bad ass while clearly struggling to gasp for air.



Last week Trump disappeared from the public eye for 3 days while keeping a very low profile and then over the weekend just tweeted and we got conflicting reports about his appearances at his private golf course resort.


Dude is either worse off than when he had covid, or at the very least, whatever the issue is has visible effects that he's embarrassed of being seen or physical effects that show his weakness.</div>

The fact that he hasn’t said anything is telling.  One of Trump’s biggest problems (polling wise) has always been that he can’t shut the fuck up for longer than like 20 seconds.  Now all of a sudden, he’s basically silent/incommunicado for multiple days?  What gives?</div>

Nothing concrete is outright said about *development*, but they are trying to imply that Chinese companies don't aim for AGI (because, despite being bullshit, it lets them present the us vs them theme that readers love far more than facts).</div>

Not saying they do not work on better models, but they have to deliver something fast because investors might be patient, they'll not wait while labs are chasing a dream even if this dream is plausible.</div>

"China is pursuing a distinct strategy in artificial intelligence compared to the United States. While U.S. tech companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google are heavily investing in developing **artificial general intelligence (AGI)** that surpasses human intelligence, China, under Xi Jinping’s direction, is instead focusing on **practical applications**: tools that are affordable, enhance productivity, and address real-world needs in sectors like agriculture, policing, healthcare, and manufacturing.

This strategy is state-backed and emphasizes **open-source development**, and is designed to sidestep the limitations imposed by U.S. semiconductor export restrictions. Although some Chinese entities are interested in AGI, Beijing currently appears risk-averse and favors immediate, incremental gains that support stability and efficiency.""</div>

I mean, in fairness. We've seen these examples of use cases in Google's AI products they've been shipping. 

I'd argue Microsoft is working on improving their copilot as best they can. Among other stuff. 

Like, yeah. These companies are investing in getting to AGI. But they're also developing usable products. I'd argue AI Mode, AI overviews, Gemini/copilot/Chatgpt, are all usable and practical products. 

Google has their AlphaEarth, AlphaEvolve, AlphaFold. As well as the satellite to track fires thing. 

So these big tech are certainly making usable products. The startups like OpenAI and anthropic and others are building only for AGI to an extent.</div>
