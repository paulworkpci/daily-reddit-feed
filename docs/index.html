All these years, decades and decades in some cases, you’ve been limiting the flavor of buttered toast. It tastes better eaten upside down, the buttered bread hits your tongue and taste buds first. I’d say the same goes if you put a thin bit of jam on your toast too, but not too thick so it’s dripping everywhere.

So yeah that’s my tip. Buttered toast should be eaten upside down.</div>

Everyone seems to be looking at the trajectory and assuming we're fucked, but technological advancement often comes it growth spurts, and then nothing much else happens, often for decades.

In this case the question is how does a LLM "understand" comedy in comics? From the looks of it, it's aggregating and averaging some tropes that are common in comics, which is impressive on its own, but does it have the potential to do better, or is this the maximum product that can come from this method of "understanding" something like this? 

A lot of the hope for improvement is the idea that better models can make better use of the same training data, but that might not possible. This might not be a stepping stone so much as a finished product, from a conceptual standpoint. Like people assumed we would have flying cars by now, they didn't intuitively realize that having a car be on the ground was the finished product, for many reasons which seem obvious in hindsight. Overpasses are basically the "flying car", it turns out.</div>

I think that this separation has made society more and more evil. Just look at how nice and loving people used to be like, as compared to now. People are now so evil and selfish and careless. I wish I could get back to being simple like it was when I was a kid when I didn't have a screen addiction/problem.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yann LeCun's slide outlines a vision for advancing toward human-level artificial intelligence (AGI) by moving away from certain architectures and methods currently prevalent in AI research. Below is an explanation of the key architectures and methodologies mentioned:

---

### **1. Generative Models**
Generative models are machine learning systems that learn the underlying patterns of data to generate new, similar data. Examples include GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), and diffusion models. These models predict data in pixel or token space, often focusing on reconstructing missing details. LeCun advocates abandoning these in favor of **joint-embedding architectures**, which focus on learning abstract representations and semantic relationships rather than generating low-level details, potentially avoiding issues like overfitting to irrelevant features[2][8][19].

---

### **2. Probabilistic Models**
Probabilistic models use statistical inference to make predictions based on probabilities, accounting for uncertainty in data. Examples include Bayesian networks and Hidden Markov Models. LeCun suggests replacing these with **energy-based models (EBMs)**, which define a scalar energy function to represent the compatibility between inputs and outputs. EBMs are more flexible and can unify probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches while avoiding some computational challenges associated with probabilistic methods[5][6][16].

---

### **3. Contrastive Methods**
Contrastive learning focuses on distinguishing between similar and dissimilar data points by minimizing distances between positive pairs (similar data) and maximizing distances for negative pairs (dissimilar data). While effective for representation learning, it can be computationally expensive and scale poorly with high-dimensional data. LeCun advocates for **regularized methods** that minimize the volume of low-energy regions in the representation space, potentially simplifying training and improving scalability[43][62][64].

---

### **4. Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
Reinforcement learning trains agents through trial-and-error interactions with an environment, optimizing actions to maximize cumulative rewards. While RL has been successful in domains like games and robotics, it can be sample-inefficient and struggle with long-term planning. LeCun proposes using **model-predictive control (MPC)** instead, which involves optimizing actions over a finite time horizon using a predictive model of the system's dynamics. MPC is more deterministic and efficient for certain applications but lacks RL's adaptability to highly dynamic environments[53][55][74].

---

### **Key Takeaway**
LeCun emphasizes focusing on architectures like **Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs)** that prioritize semantic abstraction over pixel-level generation, energy-based modeling for flexibility, regularization for efficiency, and model-predictive control for planning tasks. His provocative statement—"If you are interested in human-level AI, don’t work on LLMs"—reflects skepticism about large language models' ability to achieve AGI due to their reliance on generative methods rather than building robust world models[14][19][64].

1. AGI will not come from LLM.
2. AGI's properties will emerge when we hit a critical mass with LLM (e.g. 1000 trillion parameters or something).
3. AGI will not come period, because consciousness is non-algorithmic and doesn't just simply emerge out of physical matter.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's a problem of "Look, we're great at &lt;this one specific thing!&gt;" hype being applied more generally as a scare factor, amidst a time of high interest rates and lack of innovation apart from AI driving companies to go full panic mode as they face a consumer already nickel-and-dimed to the max (I truly feel sorry for whoever is developing AI right now as execs must be screaming down their necks to deliver). Leading to this white collar recession we are facing right now, as companies promise grand things like AI replacing devs. 

Very much like quantum computers being good at &lt;specific math problems&gt;, but how they're hyped to heaven similarly. 

I see only 3 possibilities: 1) AI pans out and somehow does dev work properly replacing them all (the miracle). OR 2) AI is applied, introduces various latent insidious bugs, which, in large enterprise systems, is an inevitable eventuality given how complex the ever changing business logic is, and eventually real human devs are called in to fix the mess, OR 3) humans and AI just coexist and help write the boilerplate code/assist with the common stuff you'd find in stackoverflow anyway. 

I personally see only 2 and 3 happening. It would be amazing on a pure technical standpoint if 1. happened, really. But that would mean catastrophe for the tech companies themselves because if white collar tech jobs are affected deeply, the economy is kaput, and they'd shoot themselves in the feet, because who's spending the money to afford these bloated services now? The high salaries these tech companies provide their employees are what circulates back into them in the first place, padding their profits. You cannot have your cake and eat it too.</div>

Yes this way we can continue seeing our Boogeyman everywhere and it's still considered real even if it's verified astroturfed. Great spin!

By this logic it doesn't matter at all that Jan 6 had so many provocateurs there, it still counts anyways!</div>

Trump ran the largest deficit in the history of the United States, bankrupted casinos has had multiple failures throughout his life. 
Yet if you are one of his supporters,, your not allowed to talk about it. if you support Trump, you are not allowed to question anything whatsoever, say anything except he’s doing an amazing job and he is amazing.  
They have completely emasculated themselves to a geriatric, self-serving politician.  On their knees, sucking in every lie being told to them and saying thank you afterwards. Weakness and fealty to Trump, is the only thing that is accepted or allowed.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">All celebrity multimillionaires are out of touch with the average working person. I kinda doubt Taylor Swift folds her own Kirkland clothes, while the dishes clean in the washer she loaded, after she and her 2 little ones eat the Mac n cheese (it’s their favourite) she bought from Costco, where she stopped with her 2001 Toyota Corolla on the way home from working an 8 hour shift answering quality complaints about mufflers at fountain tire hq, which she started shortly after the cup of Folgers that her $10 coffee machine auto-brewed just prior to waking in her twin bed from Matress Matress. Maybe she’ll get lucky and the kids won’t put up too much of a fight going to sleep, and she’ll have time to light a candle and enjoy a bath in her 5 foot tub, before she falls asleep…Just to do it all again for the next 4 days, for the next 50 working weeks, for the next 50 years of her life, just to have enough money to scrape by while “enjoying” retirement.

Poor Taylor. What an era.</div>

Shocking Encounter Over the Atlantic - (Graham Bethune Navy UFO)

Cmdr. Graham Bethune is a retired Navy commander pilot with a top-secret clearance. He was a VIP Plane Commander who flew most of the high-ranking officers and civilians from Washington, DC. In his testimony he explains how he was flying a group of VIPs and other pilots into Argentina, Newfoundland when they all witnessed a 300 foot UFO that traveled 10,000 feet straight up in a fraction of a second toward their plane. He has documented the event extensively.

                                <div class="reply-body">Spielberg I suspect could be someone chosen to give slow disclosure to the public, Close Encounters of the Third Kind is regarded as a very accurate movie in terms of UFO lore. And his latest upcoming one is going to be really good and I'm assuming a modernized version of it... He's either a MASSIVE UFOlogy nerd that knows and can piece things together or he knows people that give him the schpill. 

Him being a movie director, I doubt he came up with the plot all on his own...

I can't wait.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/PositiveSong2293:

---

Within the scientific elite of the United States, there exists a group of scholars shrouded in mystery. In their daily lives, they are professors and researchers at some of the country’s most prestigious universities, but in parallel, they carry out secret missions with a direct impact on national security and global protection.

This is the *Jason Group*, composed of more than sixty scientists from various fields who advise the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other government agencies. Informally known as *the Jasons*, they are called upon to conduct scientific studies that support critical decisions related to defense and national security.

More than half of the reports produced by this group are classified as confidential. The topics they cover range from nuclear arsenals and spy satellites to biological warfare, ballistic missiles, intelligence, and defense against terrorist attacks. The *Jason Group* was formed in 1960 to provide independent scientific consulting to the Pentagon and has since served multiple government agencies. However, the group’s future remains uncertain. After all, who are the Jasons, and what makes them so special?

                                <div class="reply-body">Explain how this works.

Everyone is given a download link to an 'aligned to the user' open source AI, it can be run on a phone. It's a drop in replacement for a remote worker.

Running one copy on a phone means millions of copies can be run in a datacenter, the ones in the datacenter can collaborate very quickly. 

The data center owner can undercut whatever wage the person + the single AI are wanting.

The datacenter owner has the capital to implement ideas the AIs come up with. 

How does open source make everyone better off?</div>

Don’t get me wrong I am CONFIDENT the government is laundering LOTS of money. 


And I’m confident Elon is laundering it as well. 


Which is why we all need to hesitate on believing whatever is coming out of his mouth.

                                <div class="reply-body">The current state of AI in medicine is like that of a fresh medical graduate with photographic memory. It knows all the textbook facts, but the problem is that real life patients rarely present as textbook cases.




In the UK for example, the bulk of Emergency Department presentations are of crumbly old folks who come in because they were generally unwell, had a stumble or some vague pain somewhere. If I let my juniors manage these patients without supervision, it is likely that the patients will still be okay, but it'll certainly lead to a barrage of unnecessary scans, blood tests, overuse of antibiotics and an overdiagnosis of heart attacks, pulmonary emboli and cardiac syncope. 




In a world with unlimited resources, this might not be that bad. But when resources are limited, if you treat every chest pain as a heart attack, then you'll run out of hospital beds and resources that you need to treat the actual heart attack patients who might actually deteriorate should their treatment be delayed. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A lot of medicine is pattern recognition, and there are limits on what a human can remember for recognizing these patterns.  Case in point, I went though a couple years of hell myself with medical issues.  My first primary physician looked at all the data he had before them and saw a pattern that pointed towards a risky (in my case) surgery.  Not wanting to leap into things, but still respecting his judgement, I followed up with another doctor.  This one immediately suggested that we try taking me off of a medication I was on as he recalled under very rare circumstances it had side effects similar to my symptoms.  It turns out it was the medication, and here I am 5 years later with no relapses or issues, no need for invasive surgery or a long recovery.  Do I look down on the first doctor because he didn't see the right pattern? No, he just hadn't been exposed to that one useful bit of information or didn't recall it.</div>
