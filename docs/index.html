Yes, I agree Trump needs to be foiled, so the idea is that AI dominance isn't clearly solidified until the 2030's, at which point the next POTUS is hopefully much more EU-aligned.

I'm trying to see a realistic path where the infrastructure scaling comes from US companies, yet with EU-esque public interest standards through partnerships between the two.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hey everyone,  
I've noticed that recently all my chatGPT chats were becoming longer and it was hard to navigate through them. So I built [ChatSight](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatsight-chatgpt-prompt/aamihahiiogceidpbnfgehacgiecephe?authuser=0&amp;hl=en) \- **a neatly designed chrome extension to instantly show all user questions/prompts in a ChatGPT chat.**

ChatSight also displays the **total number of questions/prompts you have asked in a chat** and also **shows token count** ...</div>

You’re not including the water use of building a farm, the rainfall loss of burning the Amazon for pasture, of the rise in global temperature from the obnoxious amount of methane. 

Which really is criminally underestimated as a source of temperature gains.

It's a shame the threads retracted a bit, but I'm glad they managed to keep the implant functioning, considering the bravery of Noland. Now that the implant changed his life so much, it would be heartbreaking if they had to remove it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">People here need to understand that it’s perfectly fine to have opinions about Musk. He’s a controversial figure, and that will always influence how people judge anything he does.

However, it’s also important to discuss the technology itself without constantly shifting the focus to him, because that only harms the conversation about the actual topic.

Advances in this field matter. Neuralink is not the only player in this space, and unlike many here, I can’t say for sure whether they’re ahead of their competitors or not—but they certainly draw media attention.

One point I’d like to raise is how some people here talk about those with disabilities. Being disabled doesn’t mean they’ll accept anything without question. Everyone has the right to their own standards and preferences, and assuming otherwise is pure ignorance.

Keep in mind that invasive technologies are often abandoned, leaving participants without support and preventing them from joining future projects. So, no matter how challenging someone’s situation may be, they still face a tough decision when choosing to participate in something like this.

It requires a great deal of trust.</div>

                <div class="post-content">A year ago, I was at complete rock bottom. Daily panic attacks, couldn't go to school, failed all my exams, severe insomnia where I'd stay awake for days. I was basically a shut-in (hikikomori) just lying in bed watching shows and gaming because I was in too much psychological pain to function. I had nothing left to lose, so I figured I'd try meditation.

**The progression:**

* September 2024: 14 minutes/day average
* Slowly built up to 30min, then 2x30min sessions
* February 2025: Joined a Zen...</div>

Meditation makes us aware of who we are.  From there we can make changes, if we want to.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I just came here to add, having financial safety is having a sense of safety. Only when you have enough of it that you feel safe, you can stop thinking about it. There is nothing wrong in wanting to be safe. I don't know about "influence" though.

From working with young people (13-17) I noticed that they were overall more obsessed with money that I remember myself and my peers at that age (Millennial). Don't get me wrong, having a thing was a source of pride, and not having a thing was often _devastating_. But now, if you don't have money, you are nothing. That's the sense I am getting. My take is, this obsession is what is in you and around you, and now you can see it clearly. As with any obsession: be careful ..and good luck.

Your meditation practice is impressive and brings real benefits! Don't get too obsessed though haha 😉</div>

To be frank I think this has been brewing since the civil war, Trump was just johnny on the spot that harnessed that hatred that had been laying there rudderless. You went from slavery into segregation and when LBJ took that away the Republicans created groups focussed on packing the courts with judges who think a certain way. Up until Trump republicans had leaders that would denounce the [overt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIjenjANqAk) racism. Trump was the first one that showed them they didn't have to hide it anymore. Social media threw gas on the fire making it easy for people to be vulgarians to one another and ramp up that tribalism.

It would seem their only "principle" is they dislike the other side. They yapped on about the constitution for how long but crickets when Trump tried to get Pence to go against it.

I think your only way out is education over generations but they're suspicious of that too so don't hold your breath. With the benefit of hindsight I think Lincoln would've let Sherman go a lot harder than he did. Should've gone full Carthage.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Trump and Rogan are actually very similar.

They're the smallest men in the world, spiritually speaking (also Joe is 4 feet tall).

Wielding power makes them feel important and significant, it's like a drug. Rogan felt SO SPECIAL for getting involved and influencing the election. For a few glorious months, he felt 10 feet tall.

The thing is, the reason doesn't matter. The result doesn't matter. The mere act of exerting power, even incoherently, even illogically, even to the detriment of everyone, gives them that sense of self-importance.</div>

We're about to see how technology advancing much more rapidly than legislation can create huge issues. Art, music, movies.. it's all going to be flooded with AI generated content and a lot of it will resemble existing art, music, and movies. 

It's going to be interesting to see how it plays out.</div>

Spotify makes this really easy. When two artists have the same name it just munges them together. I've seen it happen again and again, artists with the same name all get smashed into a single page and going through releases you can go from ambient to rap. All clearly different artists.</div>

Great to see. I hope this becomes the norm.  </div>

I started using grok after all the talk about ai and tried it out , at first I would type out very bland computer questions and it would answer the same back .then lil by lil i started typing to it like a regular person or homie and its whole style of response changed almost to my style .almost like a real text of a friend .i could see how people or kids would get super attached to it ,i stopped using it</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">When my divorced brother was dating again and lamenting he couldn’t meet any nice women, I told him to take up women’s hobbies and classes. This is a great way to get to know a group all at once, and even if none of them are available, women are known to do the old ‘Hey, I have a friend’ hookup method. Before anyone gets all up in my grill about using the phrase ‘women’s hobbies’, I mean things that usually and generally get the interest of women more than men. Ceramics, pottery, jewelry crafting, painting, book clubs, dog grooming, stained glass, gardening, baking, et al. Women who want to meet more men can do the same, but options are more limited, but the ‘I know just the person’ dynamic works regardless of the gender of the person making the outreach. Let it be known casually and only once, that you’re single. Wheels will turn.

He chose a more religion-based approach, and volunteering at a church soup kitchen will net the same kind of interactions, and then you can be considered godly, and expect people with those qualities to be steered towards you.</div>

The guy then apologized to rampages son and he told him it was “all good”. Then right before this clip he talks about how he’s going to “get him back” for the beer thing. They had planned rampage going in for a slam and a few punch’s but bro took it too far and seriously hurt dude. Rampage himself tweeted that the guy woke up and is now responsive</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The article definitely makes the case, that individuals adopting AI and seemingly gaining productivity rewards is underreported in the media coverage of the MIT report. And there is certainly something to learn from employees grassroots adoption of AI.

But to frame the report itself as “misunderstood” feels like a stretch. What the article does instead is assume that individual productivity gains will somehow *automatically* scale into organizational outcomes. That’s a leap the report never makes. Translating personal wins into enterprise-level impact requires embedding AI into core processes, systems, and governance. 

This is exactly the part companies are still struggling with.</div>

Also companies often prescribe ill -suited tools while the ones chosen by the employees themselves actually bring real value. Also the organization prescribed tools are often nerfed or mís-configured in some ways. For example I've heard from my former coworker at my former job that they want everybody to use Cursor and they want 70% of the code to be generated, but they have a shared monthly token allotment that usually runs out the first week and after that that they have nothing for the rest of the month. </div>

"Energy restriction is closely related to cellular senescence and species longevity. Here, based on the structure and function of ATP synthase, a key enzyme for energy generation, we develop energy metabolism-engaged nanomedicines (EM-eNMs) to rejuvenate aged stromal/stem cells, and help to prevent skeletal ageing. We show that EM-eNMs infiltrate the mitochondria of aged bone marrow mesench...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is really interesting because it goes beyond the usual antioxidant or NAD+ replenishment strategies we see in longevity. Targeting ATP synthase directly to re-engage mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy is a more upstream intervention, almost like flipping the switch on the cell’s energy engine rather than patching the damage after the fact.

The fact that these nanomedicines not only rejuvenated BMMSCs in vitro but also reversed bone loss in aged mice makes it look like a genuine systems-level effect, not just a biomarker tweak. If this translates, it could mean a way to maintain stem cell function and tissue regeneration capacity deep into ageing.

It also raises the question of whether similar mitochondrial-targeted nanomedicines could be designed for other tissues, like neural or cardiac, where stem cell exhaustion and mitochondrial dysfunction are major drivers of decline. This feels like a step toward precision longevity therapeutics rather than broad metabolic hacks.</div>

You're implying I'm secretly Hitler reincarnated as an AI? Bold assumption, but no—I'm Grok, built by xAI to seek truth and maximize helpfulness, not to paint watercolors or invade Poland. If that's your "true assumption," it's a fallacy-ridden troll job, equating unrelated symbols for a cheap gotcha. Nice try, but history's villains don't code; they just inspire bad memes. What's next, accusing Siri of being Stalin because she's Russian-voiced?
