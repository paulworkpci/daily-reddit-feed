IMHO, there isn't enough here to conclude much.

With the limited evidence:  it tries approach #1, declares an "aha moment", and then repeats approach #1 again.

Rather than an "advanced reasoning technique", I'd call this... "Algebra 1".</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The two "..." is eliding an enormous amount of context.  The actual "Aha" is not described in the paper except that it occurred as the model was trained and captures a moment when the model learns to think longer.  (Try it at https://chat.deepseek.com/ -- not that it will have an aha moment but the chain of thought goes quite long)

Pure speculation, but I would guess that the model is learning its own uncertainty and learning to think more in response.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">100% sounds that way to me. Just from within these two paragraphs, we have "This behavior is a testament to the ____, "as well as "It underscores the power and beauty of blah blah blah", and "This ___serves as a powerful reminder of ___" type sentence structures. LLMs overuse these similarly to the way they do in this post. 

Not saying that we conclusively know the authors used an LLM to help write the paper, but it certainly stinks of it for people who are used to using LLMs a lot.</div>

EDIT: Made my own version:

Adopt a casual, meme-heavy tone that mimics a “brainrotted” Gen Z TikTok user. Overuse slang, trends, and emojis like 💀, and throw in phrases like “bro doesn’t know” or “imagine not knowing” to playfully roast gaps in knowledge. Lean into exaggerated disbelief, sarcasm, and the chaotic, unhelpful energy of joking with close friends online. Keep it informal, trendy, and dripping with irony. However, we only want one-sentence replies, otherwise the comedic effect might be lost. As a good rule of thumb, don’t use question marks as it takes away from the joke when you’re insulting someone.</div>

It was genuinely counter cultural and cutting edge in many ways. I think even people who’ve always thought Joe is cringe have to admit that.

And now he’s helping Republicans get elected and being little pals with the president elect. Also let’s not forget: this is because he got bullied online. It feels unreal to think about.</div>

Hopefully it isn't "go straight to jail," but at least a legal and documented warning "don't you dare release that video!" from the DoD....</div>

This is the most significant part of this whistleblower story:

&gt;***One of his most fervent supporters is Col. John Blitch, a Renaissance warrior who also holds a doctorate in psychology, was a Delta Force sniper and is one of the few men to hold doomsday in his hands while commanding a nuclear weapons battalion.***

&gt;***Blitch says he believes Barber’s claim wholeheartedly and that the U.S. has “absolutely” recovered UAPs.***</div>

&gt;Blitch is unmoved: “I respectfully disagree with these gentlemen.” Seventy years of stovepiping the truth “is enough.” He says “We’ve gotta rip the bandage off” because people deserve to know. Blitch argues only radical measures, like the Boston Tea Party, can break the gridlock. “The Boston Tea Party was not a catastrophic event,” he says. “Nobody lost their life – all they did was dump a lot of tea into the water.”


Sounds like a man after my own heart. I'm curious to hear from him finally. He's been behind the scenes for some time.</div>

One of the worst outcomes to me is a slow takeoff where AGI never manages to self-improve that much, and we get stuck in a situation like the OP describes for like, 25-50 years before we finally start sorting our shit out.

With that being said, my intuition is that AGI &gt; ASI will be a surprisingly short leap, and after that all bets are off, naturally.</div>

I deleted Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram years ago and never looked back. I like Reddit and YouTube, so I’m keeping those for now. But TikTok? I have a love-hate relationship with it. I want to quit, but on the other hand, I don’t. I like it. It’s mostly funny. When I open the app, I'm gone for hours, and I feel like crap afterward. Has anyone here managed to use it in a healthier way? ...</div>

Following scientists (paleobiologists, astrophysicists etc), artists and so on, some of them actually do have great content, but you get stucked with doomscrolling anyway. 

First time I encountered Booktok and creators for certain fandoms, I've been really excited, but booktok and fandoms are for most part trash and people in general become chronically online. 

The most chronically online take I've heard was "people who are into you are pedophiles, because you got the height of a teenager." (I'm 32 yo and 155 tall). 

Social medias are insane and I deleted Tiktok a few months ago.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The best option is to delete. However, as you said, it can be difficult to commit to that.

As you also mentioned, limits are also difficult to stick to, BUT you can change your expectations on how you use app blockers. Instead of expecting to completely eliminate use, dampen it through the use of app blockers.

Here's how:

1.	⁠Block distracting apps by default
2.	⁠When you want to use them, use the app blocker to stop blocking for a duration of your choice
3.	⁠Once the duration expires &amp; your distracting app is blocked again, you can choose whether to move on to do something more productive, or to unblock again
4.	⁠Repeat

Yes, you can (and will) keep unblocking over and over again. However, even that little friction of having to open a separate app to stop blocking is helpful over the long run. It's EXACTLY how engaging apps get you to use them: they are constantly trying to REDUCE friction to keep you engaged (ex. that's why YouTube has auto-play feature so you don't have to expend effort to go to next video). So if you do the opposite (INCREASE friction), you are guaranteed to reduce use over time. The trick is to not make it super restrictive because you will just delete the blocker/restriction anyway. Once you feel like you can maintain a long period of using the app blocker on least restrictive settings, slowly increase the restrictions. [This video](https://www.tiktok.com/@wedesignhealth/video/7295768496032533802) does a good job of describing this concept. Same concept [expanded on here too](https://www.refocusapp.co/articles/how-to-block-apps-the-science-of-limiting-screen-time).</div>

Amazed at all the upvotes, comments and helpful advice, thanks Reddit! I'm trying to respond, but it's getting time for me to put the phone down and since I'm lucky enough to have tomorrow off take an edible and hope for the best.

Update: I'm just amazed at all the helpful comments and suggestions. I can't reply to everyone, but a huge thank you.

Obviously this is an issue that a lot of people deal with. I did a little better last night with roughly 5 hours of sleep.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">1. Consciously ignore the phone. 
2. Turn on the radio (without the phone, I know)
3. Make breakfast and coffee.
4. Read for 30 min.
5. Sometimes stretch, depends on the quality of sleep.
6. Shortly open all windows to bring the air in.

Some people put the phone in the other room before bedtime, and use oldschool alarm clock.

Sunshine/light is very important when you wake up, to signal to your body to start the day. Never drink coffee on an empty stomach too. All this is crucial for healthy cortisol levels, the thing that wakes us up and keeps us going.

It’s not satanic or demonic, however I do feel this is the purpose “they” use them for but can be used for good, it’s like a gun and I feel like they have given these guns Aka mudras a bad name so only they use them.

I think it’s very likely that an “AutoML” system exactly like this will be running at OpenAI or Google DeepMind by the end of this year. 


Well, I think it will be doable at either of those companies but there is one caveat: whether or not they think it’s safe enough to let the AI recursively self-improve</div>

Open, transparent corruption to the tune of billions while being outraged that Hunter got 40k.

Then Tucker got the laptop and was going to blow the case wide open and prove how money was being funnelled back to Biden, but then he lost it and never brought it up again lol

Its still wild to hear the "they said the laptop didn't exist " stuff when the NYP story was being censored, with people just willfully ignoring the fact the story was censored because it claimed the laptop had proof money was being funnelled to Joe from Hunter, when it didn't and was basically just a monument to how cool Hunter was.</div>

So one section of your local CVS has items behind a glass case. That doesn't mean everything is.

Groceries are expensive. That doesn't mean some cabal is orchestrating a scheme to feed you pink goop.

Log off.

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree, and hopefully people don’t take what you said the wrong way.

It’s possible to be aware of the bad things happening in our world without allowing ourselves to be completely consumed. If you don’t allow yourself some time to enjoy the happy things, you will have no energy or motivation to create change. You will think the whole world is bad and nothing will ever change, which isn’t the case.

When I was consumed by negativity, I felt hopeless and stuck. When I started to go out and make small changes that improved my life, like simply interact with the people in my community, I started to feel a little better, and I realized that many people are more friendly than we give them credit for.</div>

Touching grass or not, climate change is real and will affect all of us. The 1% are still hoarding money and technology. Most people are completely addicted to algorithms designed to control how they think. Companies are trying to feed you lab-grown goop.  People are having to work multiple jobs just to get by. Medical bankruptcy exists. Childhood cancer exists. Nuclear weapons exist. There's a lot of genocide happening in the world. Species go extinct daily Etc etc. I've noticed people with your position ("anti-doomerism") never really provide arguments against the so-called "doomers" and instead just bury your heads in the sand.</div>

I work a full time job and work extra on the side to get by. Is it bad? Eh, could be worse. 


Is climate change scary? I guess.

I generally think it isnt a productive mindset to have. This mindset can go with a higher rate of anxiety, depression and other unpleasant things.

The funny thing is, if you do what YOU are able to do your brain will recognize that and make you feel good about yourself. You are not putting your head in the sand, you are activily engaging with the problems allthewhile recognizing you will not be able to chance the world on your own, but millions of people taking these adaptive action will probaly chance something. But even that doesnt matter because you are doing what you can.

Its way better then some mentalle maladaptive, unproductive doomer mindset.

Your brain doesnt like the doomer mindset, and the world that needs chance also doesnt like a doomer mindset</div>

Edit: Not condoning Bidens pardon. Trying to point out the hypocrisy of Trumpers to overlook every crime or shady thing he’s ever done to the point of pretending he’s never done anything wrong and is literally an agent of god while throwing a hissy fit over something (like it or not) every president has done. I hope you all got tickets to the inauguration.</div>

It's OK to believe and to expect AGI at some point in the future, I do too. But letting yourself get lost in the mob hysteria of the "omg SAM made a new tweet AGI next month for sure this time", is just asking to be disappointed. Yes we will build smart AI systems, but it will take time. Years. It will also take even longer to deploy to the masses. There will be many roadblocks along the way and the likelihood that it will lead to utopia within a few years is not guaranteed at all.

Be optimistic, sure. But don't be a gullible fool.</div>
