1) it has basically no / no positional recollection besides what it decided to write down through text

2) it basically only remembers the last 10 minutes

this puts it in a near-infinite loop of "lets check the left wall! i haven't checked that yet!" while forgetting which ladders actually take it from floor to floor

otherwise, it's pretty damn smart. but these limitations hold it back HARD.</div>

We know LLMs can learn new things not in their training data in an active context. I'd imagine with practically infinite context and a couple of months of real-life experience, it will be basically AGI...

Side note: reasoning and recursive shifting focus are not the same thing. Both are needed for autonomous agents. It's also why, despite having really solid in-context reasoning, they can't own a project (of any kind) by themselves.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">there's no magic pill (unless you have ADHD in case there might be some help). 

The best thing you can do for yourself is to make a plan - time block your calendar to work on the things you want to work on and time block rest also. Best thing you can do is start backwards - time block sleep so you are getting enough, time block 30 minutes for a walk if you can and time for eating as well. Than fill in the gaps with the things you want to do and be realistic (add in commute, time to de-stress or unwind after work, etc..)

  
You also just might be burned out based on all that you are doing which is a catch-22 because the best thing to do would be to quit your job but you also need money and income to survive. the second best thing to do is to cut out all excess stuff right now and focus on self care if you are burned out (sleep, water, nutrition, exercise, socializing).</div>

i've tried putting my phone far away from my bed, but i just end up sprinting across the cold room to turn off the stupid thing, and then i'm back in my cozy warm bed. i try to actually wake up, but i'm passed out in what feels like a few seconds.

any other tips? i've heard of people getting a sunrise alarm clock, which seems super cool! but i can't really afford something like that at the moment.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">One trick that works for a lot of people is forcing movement before your brain can argue. As soon as you turn off your alarm, instead of climbing back in bed, do something slightly active—stretch, drink a glass of water, or even just sit on the floor for a minute. The shock of getting out of bed makes it harder to slip back in.

Another thing that might help is giving your body a reason to wake up. If your room is freezing, keep a cozy robe nearby so getting up isn’t miserable. If you like coffee or tea, set it up the night before so all you have to do is hit a button. Small incentives can trick your brain into wanting to stay up.

Also, do you tend to fall back asleep because you're still too tired? If so, your sleep quality might need tweaking—like adjusting bedtime, light exposure, or even hydration before bed.</div>

At some point, your body will violently jolt awake in sheer terror, convinced you’ve overslept by at least three time zones. Nothing gets you out of bed faster than existential panic.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Dude was caught squatting in a home doing meth with a prostitute. When a bike cop caught him, he got his information and arrested him. He was released with a trial to be set. 

Problem his dude didn’t give his name. He gave my name and my mom’s address. Dude was my little brother. 

That’s not even the messed up part. My mom was getting notifications in the mail for &gt;my name&lt; to appear in court sent to her home. Then notifications for a warrant. She said nothing to me because, as she later explained after I was arrested at my work, “I didn’t think you would be in trouble. You know how many times your brother has been in prison. I just couldn’t see that happen to him again.”

I told her that I requested the arresting officer to be at the trial and that I would be bringing a picture of my brother. She begged and pleaded with me to not do that. Fortunately, a friend a mine represented me pro bono, so at least I had that going for me. 

My counsel asked to approach the bench before trial started, and showed the judge the picture. The judge then asked the officer to approach, and all I heard was the cop point to me and say, “Yeah, that’s not the guy,” he pointed at the pic and said “*That’s* the guy!”

Judge just sighed heavily, and said “Case dismissed.” And that was that. Years later, I was pulled over at a traffic stop. The officer ran my name, and it still came up that someone with warrants could be impersonating me, so I had to prove I was who I said I was by taking off my shirt in the cold to show I had no tattoos. 

Good times.

Edit- ooh, I forgot. Lawyer friend told me that once the correct name was given, that he was arrested in another state. Turns out he was carrying an out of state fake ID, with my name on it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I have the same brother from the same type of mother! We’ll call him Joe.

I got transferred by work to a new state and had to set up a new home. My older brother Joe had lived there for a spell a decade before. My mother came to visit. The electricity went down and I asked her to phone in the outage for me when I went off to work. 

Four days went by. I finally went in person to the power company. The clerk told me that I had an outstanding bill for $800+. I explained that it was impossible because I had just moved there. She then said that the power company was on to me, that they new that I was Joe’s mother, that Joe was living with me, and that I had put the account in my name to fool the power company.

I just about fell over because I had gone no contact with Joe many years before. I explained that I was not Joe’s mother, that Joe did not live with me, and that I have no children. The lady didn’t believe me.

While it’s easy to prove that one has a child—-birth certificate!—- how does one prove that one does not have a child!

The situation was so crazy-making!

Finally, I handed the lady my drivers license and asked her to note my date of birth and to look up Joe’s date of birth on his outstanding bill. When she saw that Joe had been born years before me, she apologized.

My situation is not nearly as bad as yours, OP, but I can relate!</div>

He dropped it because of all the backlash, since nominating a pedofile for the highest law enforcement position in the country is a bad look... you can't make up how stupid this administration is 😂.</div>

All of these rich people at the top have some kind of history with diddling and suddenly Rogan won't talk about it when they come on his podcast. They have convinced 70+ million of the dumbest Americans that diddling kids isnt an issue to worry about.

Now it looks like they are tanking the economy. They want people to be poor and desperate. There are these old pictures of people actually selling their kids. They are trying to get people that desperate again. This is all so gross.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not quite. Matt Gaetz withdrew his own nomination for AG because he learned that he wouldn't have enough votes from Republicans in the senate. Supposedly eight hard no's and another seven probable no's. Trump still wanted Gaetz as AG because he believed Gaetz would operate loyally and unethically, having been a proven MAGA diehard, specifically in conjunction with Trump's plan to unleash a torrent of legally dubious executive orders when his term began. Gaetz simultaneously resigned from Congress because he wanted to stymie the Ethics Committee report investigating him that was set to release days later. There's no doubt that Trump would care at all about hiring a child sex trafficker so long as he was loyal to a fault, and I suspect Trump picked him because he likes compromised figures in terms of leverage as a form of insurance.</div>

You may chat with the characters exhibit, and all the humans will behave exactly as a real 21st century human would have done.  Notice their perception of time and space as distinct.  See how they struggle against each other. Even though they are individually only 0.0000001% as smart as a common starherder, and appear dull try asking one about politics or sexual activities and see how animated and motivated they become.  It's amazing to think that these creatures made our primitive forebears.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">In about a billion years, increasing solar radiation will boil away the oceans, making life impossible. That means we exist in a tiny window of time when Earth is both habitable and capable of supporting intelligent life.

Earth’s climate has fluctuated wildly over its history, yet for the last ~10,000 years (since the dawn of civilization), it has been remarkably stable

All the while the moon and sun are just far enough apart that they appear the same size to give us total solar eclipses. While Jupiter protects us from the majority of asteroids. 

A supervolcano almost wiped out early humans 75,000 years ago.

An asteroid impact (like the one that killed the dinosaurs) hasn’t happened in human times—despite Earth being hit frequently on geological timescales.

The Cold War came incredibly close to ending in nuclear catastrophe multiple times.

In only a century we went from horse-drawn carts to AI, quantum computing, and space travel.



Now… We are this close to singularity. It’s fucking weird, right?</div>

Only if humans aren't here anymore. 

Through star lifting it is possible to pull excess iron out of the sun using the sun itself as the energy source to power large magnets. 

You can also add new hydrogen over time, perhaps by taking it from others stars or Jupiter.

This can extend the life of our sun essentially indefinitely. 

Being humanity's home star, there's no reason we wouldn't do this, both for sentimental reasons and to protect all the investments we've made into the solar system.</div>

My personal theory is (if we end up making AGI/ASI in the next decade or so) that in the big retrospective of history, the Singularity began when we invented electronic computing, and arguably earlier, but that was the key innovation that made rapid progress a forgone conclusion. 

People who literally worked on the first microprocessors are alive to witness the advent of AI. Given the incredibly short timespans we're talking about here, the degree of acceleration feels inevitable, we were already falling into the Singularity, but it was just too early to realize we had crossed the event horizon.</div>

This is Orion lol. A very incremental improvement that opens up no new possibilities.

Hmm, I'm on the plus tier, but not in any rush, so a week's wait is no big deal for me personally.

I'm mostly interested in accuracy on scientific questions, so OpenAI's introduction page [https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-5/](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-5/) doesn't look too hopeful. In the appendix, the scores they show for GPQA(science) show 4.5 at 71.4% while o3-mini(high) was better, at 79.7%  Ouch</div>

After public outcry, McDonald's dropped the "Supersize" option back in 2004.

At least in our lifetimes. it's up to individuals, or new parents or whoever to be aware, proactive and decide to change their habits and limit exposure. They're just giving us a buffet of content, most of it slop but they can squirm out of any corner of responsibility or liability since no one is forced to use it or consume it. We all have the choice to read a book, go on a walk, meditate, leave our phones at home. Take the baby steps toward the freedom from digital algorithmic overload, it's your only option. 

The responsibility is ours to take on, regardless of the normalization and challenge it takes after decades of becoming slowly addicted. It's pretty severe for a lot of us, but just start somewhere to ween off of the digital crack. It's brutal since every single hit is free. </div>

If McDonald's was like these platforms and tech firms, their business model would be to get as many customers as possible in the store and not profit. They would have "free" burgers paid for by ads in the store. Other fast food chains would go out of business because they can't compete with free.


Now where there used to be ten fast food stores, there's only McDonalds. They're still on the "get big quick" part of their scheme 25 years later. They still get by by getting investment. Recently someone figured out how to have a robo AI burger flipper. They tell the Investers that the robo flippers will cure cancer and solve world hunger. Unfortunately the robo flippers are being used but in wrong ways. Now you go to school or your job, and all the food tastes like McDonalds, except now it tastes worse while everyone tells themselves how great it is. </div>
