No matter what technique I tried, my thoughts would only quiet down for a few seconds before rushing back. Honestly I started believing maybe I just wasn’t capable of real stillness.

Here’s the practice: instead of fighting your thoughts directly, shift your attention to the physical sensations of your body, especially the contact points like where your hands rest on your knees or yo...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There’s a great book called *Better In Every Sense: How The New Science Of Sensation Can Help You Reclaim Your Life* 

It’s written by two neuroscientist/researchers who are also meditators - and out of the 10+ years of meditating, this is the one book that finally made everything click.

Basically goes on about things like you said/pointed out. They call it “sense foraging”. And it’s all backed by legit research.

There are some parts where it talks and goes into detail about brain science-y things, but it helps make sense of how your brain and Default Mode Network (DMN) works and how to get out of your DMN.</div>

I’ve had the same problem with meditation and it always felt impossible to “turn off” my head.

You're essentially taking the most ornate features built to last from 100 years ago and comparing it to low income housing. There were plenty of plain looking or shoddily constructed house back then as well. They just aren't around anymore. Like do you seriously think that every highway had ornate railings like that back in the 1920s? They probably just didn't have any at all.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Tried it myself 

Is my PC considered good? Specs graphics card: 4090 CPU: 9950x3d Ram: 64 GB CL30 Memory: 32 GB hard drive Monitor: PROTON 17" CRT OS: Dos No wifi Ethernet port: 10 GB/s Computer case: a fish tank with the water removed.

It gave me the following answer

Let’s break it down:

The Amazing Parts

GPU: RTX 4090 – absolute top-of-the-line gaming/workstation card. Nothing beats it for raw graphical horsepower.

CPU: Ryzen 9 9950X3D – doesn’t exist yet, but if you meant something like a 7950X3D or 9950X (future naming), then yes, insanely powerful. Perfect for gaming and heavy workloads.

RAM: 64 GB CL30 – more than enough, and with tight timings (CL30), it’s extremely fast.

Ethernet: 10 Gb/s – absurdly future-proof networking, faster than 99% of people’s internet.

Case: Fish tank (dry) – unique, stylish, and conversation-starting. Just hope no one accidentally refills it.

The Questionable Parts

Memory: “32 GB hard drive” – that’s not enough to install Windows 11, let alone a modern game. Likely you meant 2 TB SSD or something, but if it really is 32 GB, it’s basically the storage of a phone from 2013.

Monitor: Proton 17″ CRT – tiny by modern standards (most people use 27″+), heavy, and capped to low resolutions/refresh. Even though CRTs can look smooth, your 4090 is crying in the corner.

OS: DOS – legendary, but… no modern apps, no games, no GPU drivers. You’d basically be running Doom (1993) on a system that could simulate the universe.

No Wi-Fi – not necessarily bad, since Ethernet is superior, but you’ll miss wireless convenience.

Verdict

Your PC is like putting a rocket engine in a horse-drawn carriage.

Raw power: 10/10

Practicality: 2/10

Style points for the fish tank case: 100/10

👉 If you swap that 32 GB drive for at least a 2 TB SSD, get a proper monitor, and run Windows/Linux, this build becomes god-tier. Right now though, it’s like owning a Lamborghini but only driving it around a tiny dirt lot.

Do you want me to “rate it seriously” (performance potential vs bottlenecks) or “roast it harder” for comedy value?

You said:
I was serious about the 32 GB of storage. Would upgrading to 64 GB be enough? 
ChatGPT said:

Got it — you really do mean 32 GB of total storage.

Here’s the deal:

Why 32 GB (or 64 GB) Isn’t Enough

Modern OS size:

Windows 11 fresh install takes ~25–30 GB.

Linux distros like Ubuntu can take 10–20 GB.

DOS is tiny, but then your 4090 and CPU basically become a space heater.

Game sizes:

Call of Duty: Warzone – ~120–150 GB.

Cyberpunk 2077 – ~70–100 GB with patches.

Even indie games often hit 5–10 GB.

Updates, drivers, and caches: Your system will choke instantly. Even Chrome caches can eat a few gigabytes.

So upgrading from 32 GB → 64 GB is like buying a second shot glass because the first one was too small to hold a gallon of water.

The Realistic Minimum

For basic use (OS + a few apps): 256 GB SSD.

For gaming: 1 TB is the sweet spot.

For future-proofing / creator work: 2 TB+.

Storage is cheap: a decent 1 TB NVMe SSD is ~$40–60. Compare that to the RTX 4090 ($1,800) sitting in your fish tank, bored.

Verdict

Upgrading to 64 GB storage is pointless — you’ll still run out immediately.
You need hundreds of gigabytes, not tens.

👉 Want me to put together a “storage upgrade roadmap” for you (budget → high-end) so you know exactly what drive sizes make sense for your monster build?

You said:
Could I use part of my ram to get more storage? I don't really need 64 GB of ram so maybe use half og it to get another 32 GB of storage
ChatGPT said:

Ah, you’re talking about RAM disks (using part of your RAM as storage). That’s actually a thing — but there are some serious caveats:

How RAM Disks Work

You can reserve, say, 32 GB of your 64 GB RAM and make it look like a drive.

It will be blazing fast (far faster than SSDs).

But… it’s volatile memory → when you power off or reboot, poof, everything on it disappears.

Why This Doesn’t Solve Your Problem

Operating system &amp; programs: You need storage that persists when you shut down. RAM disks don’t do that.

Games: Imagine installing Cyberpunk on a RAM disk → works while your PC is on, but after restart, it’s gone.

Practical limit: You’d still only have ~32 GB persistent storage (your hard drive), which is barely enough for the OS and updates.

The Hybrid Hack (still not great)

Some people:

Use a small persistent drive (SSD/HDD) for OS.

Load their favorite game into a RAM disk each session for insane speeds.

Example: Copy a 20 GB game into RAM on boot. It runs buttery smooth, but you waste minutes copying every time.

It’s more of a novelty / niche performance trick, not a real replacement for proper storage.

Verdict

Yes, you can use RAM as temporary storage.

No, it won’t replace a real SSD. You still need at least a 512 GB+ SSD for day-to-day use.

👉 If you want, I can show you exactly how to set up a RAM disk on Windows/Linux for fun, but I’d strongly recommend you buy a cheap SSD to actually make your beast PC usable.

Do you want me to show you the RAM disk setup steps just so you can mess with it?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Damn this may be the most impressive robotics demo I’ve seen. 

Incredibly robust with how the people were messing with it and how it could overcome that. 

Then the fact that it’s actually moving and positioning its body dynamically to pick up all this stuff. 

Insane progress!</div>

 I really don't understand how Boston Dynamics robots still generate hype, we are not in 2018 anymore, the frontier has moved a lot. They can't even get cost-efficient robots after all this years.

                                <div class="reply-body">UPDATE: ICE has sent a statement on this man’s detention, saying his name is David Perez-Teofani and that he was arrested in Fairfax County in 2024 and charged with aggravated sexual battery against a minor under 13. Fairfax County court records show the charges were later dropped. An ICE spokesperson tells me it’s an example of “prosecutors refusing to prosecute.” I’ve reached out to the Fairfax County Commonwealth’s attorneys office for comment.

It would take the best artists on the planet, the top 0.001% of photorealistic artists, a year, to produce what these systems can produce in seconds. 

The difference is the human artist could understand context and be a lot more specific abotu the composition and content of the image. But the actual quality of the output would be, at best, equal, but take 100000x as long to produce. 

By the same token(lol), no human could translate an entire pdf, or summarize it in seconds. It would, again, take them weeks, at best.

These systems fail in some ways we still excel, but they are superhuman in many other ways, and we don't know how hard it will be to patch in the stuff they still cant do better than us, but when we do, they wont match us, they have already exceeded us.</div>

Issue with this chart is that it doesn't come from a peer-reviewed academic journal. Semrush is an AI marketing business, so you should take it with a pile of salt. (Edit: Incorporating u/ImportantCommentator 's response below —notice how the percents add up to 273.7%)


It would also be nice if we had a direct link to the source, OP!</div>

The model looks at each token so if you say 

NO 'any'

For the ease of the argument let's say that's 4 tokens. No, ', any, and '.

If it doesn't apply the negative no correctly then you just told it to use 'any'.

So a better way to prompt engineer is to show it examples of a good response to an example real world prompt.  Make sure those examples are absolutely perfect.</div>

Interestingly, Sam having seen hundreds of founders at YC, he may just be applying the fake it until you make it approach, let's hope he doesn't end up being the next Elizabeth Holmes / SBF. It sounds like he can keep raising, despite the org structure still being a question mark, so he should be able to keep going, assuming the GPT5 launch fiasco was just a hiccup. 

OpenAI failing may cause a mini, transitory AI winter, although it would make it pretty clear who would win once Spring comes around (Demis most likely, unless Dario gets most of the OAI diaspora).</div>

Of course the worst are the 20 page posting of new physics gibberish.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Many years ago Mercedes wanted to be the only car manufacturer for German taxis because they wanted to move away from the luxury image. They wanted to appeal to the masses with less luxury- and more utility-focused cars.

And it brought them huge success.

Mercedes being associated with luxury is true, however what they really stand for in my opinion is reliability and their ride quality. Both are not exclusive to luxury.

(Of couse, "made in Germany" has not been what it used to be for many years now. VW, BMW, Mercedes all have gone downhill if you ask me)</div>

I’m taking C classes, GLBs, etc. I think the brand image is already pretty poor. I recently considered an E450 All Terrain, and I just couldn’t pull the trigger even though it was a really nice car, I just associate MBs with posers and people trying to appear to have money.</div>

All they have is brand cache, which they can rely on to push cheaper and worse quality cars.</div>

In order to get that, you can’t have adaptive cruise control since that’s where the radar would be. 

It really tells you who’s ~~buying~~ leasing the car as just a status symbol lol.</div>

But then when AI tips over a point, probably related to physical world success (AGI level robots), we'll see a sudden surge.


So, slow enough start for people to be fooled into thinking this was all hype. And then a sudden, sharp rug pull. Warning signs: mass humanoid robot production and adoption. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think the tipping point is going to be before robots start being mass produced. Even if LLM progress seriously stagnates for the next few years, agentic tools 2 years from now will be good enough to do most office job tasks if the systems are well integrated enough. 

SOTA models today can do pretty much any task you ask them to, with the big caveat that you have to give the model proper context. Future agents will be able to functionally do the exact same things you do on a computer, including reading websites, internal resources, and files, filling out forms, sending messages, interacting with enterprise software, writing scripts to automate things, etc. They will also be able to create and maintain personal, team, org, and company wide knowledge bases that basically act as a centralized repository for all kinds of up to date information. 

When an agent gets asked to do a task, it will do exactly what a human would but even more thorough. Collect relevant information, understand the current state of the system, gather requirements, come up with implementation plans, create defined acceptance criteria, start implementing, note what works or doesn't, compare to acceptance criteria and adjust or try another approach if needed, get reviews from all kinds of different sources (including humans and other agents), finalize the change, and update knowledge bases. Some of this, especially the knowledge base part, may seem far fetched, but that's from the perspective of using today's agents, which are essentially a loop calling an LLM api with a custom system prompt and a few key features like tool integration and hooks on top.

Someone will make a system like this (or a bit worse) and using it will radically change productivity. Companies will be quickly forced to adopt similar systems or be outcompeted. I'm not going to try and predict what will happen, but asset prices rising a lot and a lot of office workers getting laid off seem very likely.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If AI agents can replace a human in a cost-effective way, then organizations that use them will have a competitive advantage over those that don't. There will be a lot of pressure to adopt once the benefits are proven.

The only thing that may hold back adoption is a fear of backlash, but even that effect will probably be limited to consumer-facing products or services.</div>

Ai needs to be banned as soon as possible. We do not realise what horror we are about to unleash on our civilsation. This is the fermi paradox. A thousand other civilisations from across the universe have ended themselves with AI. Let us buck the trend and be one of the rare few who outlaw it and preserve our civilsations.
