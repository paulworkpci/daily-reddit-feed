By retracing significant research they are probably very close to the theory behind (parts?) of o1 - but putting this into production still involves a lot of engineering &amp; math blood, sweat and tears.</div>

And o1 is the path to mastering all measurable benchmarks.

What this means for the future of open source and running locally cannot be overstated.

There will be a 8b version of an o3 model. It will be open source. 😂 The world is literally unlocking intelligence real-time.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I heard this from a CPA friend over the holidays. The reason there's so much focus on software engineers getting replaced is because:

\- SWEs are the first people to try this new tech and see the writing on the wall. They're the most vocal about being replaced.

\- AI companies are focusing on automating Software Development first, because software can automate everything else.

\- Software and math lead to compounding self-improvement of LLMs, which is another reason they're focused on coding ...</div>

This is inevitable. It is what has happened EVERY TIME we have made coding speed improvements in tech. We make it easier to make more complex software and then discover that the software we need is neverending and developers then make more and more complex stuff that they could never have made on their own previously.

Software engineers are safe.</div>

Engineers

Doctors

Emergency sector for government 

These 3 will be the last sectors to get fully automated.

Let's get into why, shall we...

1. Accountability ( people need someone accountable or take responsibility, ai fucked your operation, ai fucked your release and crashed 20% devices..... No one busy this)

2. Accuracy ( 10 people improve each other's accuracy in a software engineer team, if you reach to level where ai agents can collaborate and correct each other and not repeat same issues and learn from it on fly...theny this can get replaced)

3. Security ( ai code is correct but that can be optimised and become secure as per your requirement. It highly depends on your product how you code... Correct code isn't always secure., no weapons for ai......)

4. Context ( current systems are built by using 100 microservices and support 100 other,how you add a feature without breaking others features.... This takes high level architecture understanding and understanding traffic of your service and not just that, you need to understand how customers interact with it...)

These can be automated by end of 2035 , if we get an ai, which can understand complex architecture of your product, why and how customer uses it, learn on the fly from other ai agents (ex security agent and optimize agent debate out which is better to write etc).

So by the time software engineer getts fully replaced(100%) , all other would be automated long ago......</div>

‘Don’t you dare look at me. Looking leads to liking and liking leads to loving and loving leads to fucking. Do you want to fuck me private?’

Private: ‘sir, no sir!’

Drill instructor:’WHY NOT!?!’</div>

This is an advertisement

The comedians marketing team sells/gives this story to the news station

It's a symbiotic relationship. The news stations gets to run a story about something being "controversial" and "causing backlash" which draws in viewers and helps them fill their desperate need to find content without actually having to pay a journalist. And the comedian gets free publicity which will generate extra views when people get curious and go to check it out for themselves.</div>

By cutting out the time i waste scrolling I’ve become a lot more comfortable in doing nothing. Like I sometimes just sit down and stare into space. I just can’t get myself to actually do the work that I need to do. 

I’m able to sit down for like an hour just p...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think one of the changes that really helped me cut down my screen time was getting a minimalist phone launcher. I got an app called Blank Spaces Launcher (on ios) i think it’s on android too but there are multiple apps that can do this. Essentially it makes your home page a row of apps that you can click on. Don’t keep any web browser on this stack. I also deleted all social media apps and made it so i can only access them through browser.   Then I made all the icons on my phone black and white. I also created some shortcuts which make it so that when i open my web browser it turns black and white. 

With all of this the biggest thing that helped me was having intention and hobbies. I used to have a bad habit of using my phone whenever I was moving between tasks. In the hallways between my classes, in the bathroom, walking home from school, during class (especially independent work time), etc. I’ve kind of avoided taking my phone out of my bag during class. Whenever I’m around people I know I completely try to avoid using my phone unless it’s important and entertain myself with their presence. Also I have adopted hobbies for when I’m alone. I play piano daily, occasionally do Sudoku puzzles, bother my mom, journal, solve Rubiks cubes, and I recently got an ereader so hopefully i can start reading more. For the intention aspect of it, just think about why you’re opening your phone before you use it. 

It should be evident by the fact that I went to post this that I’m not a very productive person despite all of this. My screen time is lowest out of all my friends but my productivity is also lowest of all my friends. So please don’t do all of this with the expectation that it will suddenly fix all your problems. The main benefits that I have noticed is just that my mind feels a bit quieter, I’m far less stressed about the state of the world, and my attention span is slightly better. 


TLDR 
- Get minimalist phone launcher 
- Make all app icons in black and white
- Grayscale on the apps you use too much or your whole phone 
- Use all social media apps through the browser 
- Delete the games on your phone 💔
- Avoid your phone when doing another task like going to bathroom or walking
- Use your phone with intention (think about why you’re opening it) 
- Get hobbies 
- This doesn’t fix all your problems and i still have a lot of work to do in order to undo years (basically since I was in primary school 😭😭😭) of not paying attention in class and procrastination

                        <div class="comment-body">You may be experiencing one of 3 types of procrastination. See which one sounds closer to what you experience.

Operational procrastination: the actual task is difficult. There are many steps that aren't intuitive. You would have to practically write down a list of small things for you to do to complete it.

Avoidance (emotional) procrastination: the task you are avoiding carries with it the experience of negative emotion. If you were to attempt this task, you will likely feel some unpleasant emotion.

Idealistic procrastination: "things have to be just right before I start"

I'm not the best at explaining this, so I will just link the video where I learned about these distinctions and how to deal with each of them.

                                <div class="reply-body">I was born in 1970 in Argentina. Back in the 90's we could afford most things, we earned enough money to save and to live comfortably. After 4 months working at Yacireta dam I was able to buy a fridge, a kitchen, and air conditioner and my first computer. 

I visited mom monthly and I bought her an air conditioner, a Conqueror that still works. 

You could save for a month or two and buy most basic things from furniture to a small cc bike, straight up in cash. 

For some years that is impossible to do now. Either you need to use a credit card to buy things in installments that always end up costing from 20 to 200% more (the more installments you want, the more % in interests you have to pay). 

Early 2021 I bought a 150cc bike because work, it was $ 125,000 (Argentinian pesos) in cash but of course, minimum salary and what I earned was $50,000 so it was impossible for me, so usually you find someone with a better salary who buys the thing in installments. I had to pay $30,000 for the first installment and then 23 more monthly installments of $ 21,000. So basically I paid $560k for a bike. When I finished paying the total, the current price of the bike was $ 360,000. 

Same with a new fridge, wardrobe, etc. Unless you work at some high level politic position or you are some company higher up, you don't get to buy things with your salary. For 'normal' people's salary, if you want a new phone you need to up to 5 salaries to afford one of the last 2 generation of phones.

I know inflation plays a big role on all of this and I know that every time the salaries were announced to be raised, companies already started raising the price of things just because have to "catch up" to the salary increase.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The short answer is that this is capitalism at work. Not content with selling you a good product at a reasonable price, companies want a drip feed of subscriptions with all that lovely cash flow and potential for price increases.

Did you know Microsoft still makes a standalone Office package? Not that you'll ever know it given how heavily they promote Office 365, but you can [buy a license and download Office 2024](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2024/09/30/office-2024-for-consumers-available-october-1/) and be done with it.

Alternatively there's [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), an open source and completely free package which is fine for just about everyone. It's just that you have to be a little nerdy to know about it and try it out. After all, its advertising budget is $0.

That's the thing, though, you have to be a bit nerdy to get around all this stuff. Fed up with the OS built into your TV? [Use a large computer monitor](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-use-pc-monitor-as-tv/) and an OTT box plugged into its HDMI port. Don't want to subscribe to a cloud service? Get a [Network Attached Storage](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-nas-network-attached-storage-devices) system and plug it into your network.

There are even ways to do [home automation](https://www.home-assistant.io/) under local control rather than through an external service.

But this all depends on enthusiast-level to expert-level knowledge, not bog-standard consumer level stuff. It really helps to be or know someone who has used tech since at least the early 2000s - the pre-iPhone era. They're practiced in trouble-shooting and knowing how to ask the right questions to get the answer they need.

As for cars. I bought one a few months ago. A no-frills 2007 manual Suzuki Swift with 75,000 km (46,600 miles) on the odometer. No touch screens, no firmware updates. I intend to take care of that vehicle as long as possible.

                        <div class="comment-body">Yesterday, we played a Harry Potter Switch game the wife got the kids for the first time. The game needed 54 minutes to download an update. And then we trudged through a "we want to sell your data to 3rd parties" screen where you had to give your personal information over to them if you wanted to opt out of it. 

Today, I wanted to check my Facebook messages on my laptop, as I have since 2006. I was not allowed to access my messages this time, until I engaged in some multi-factor authentication through the Messenger app or the Facebook app (neither of which I want to have on my device, which is why I check the messages on the laptop). 

I fear for the day when I am expected to take business calls not over Microsoft Teams or Zoom, but over VR. My old man told me that he always tried to be the first person in the office who understood and embraced new technology, that it gave him a leg up on colleagues to have that toolbox and reputation. But technology was steadily advancing in the 80's and 90's; now, we just get a cascade of slightly improving consumer goods which are made to go obsolete in time for the replacement to be lined up. There are some really cool, advanced technologies out there (research labs across the globe are still burning the midnight oil), but what we get exposed to is a gamified world of micro-transactions and subscriptions.</div>

I hope Lue is legit, I think he might be, but he is ex-counter intel so he knows best how to deceive people.

                                <div class="reply-body">Bro, the data. T*he data.* Just think of the data you would collect from the universal assistant Hassabis describes. 

You're changing the ad game from static images plastered all over websites hoping to get click through to subtly influencing consumer habits through their free assistant. And now you're not only tracking where these people go or what websites they visit, but how they think on a fundamental level through rich conversation. 

I think google shareholders would be more than willing to give that away for free and eat tremendous losses to establish dominant market share. And they are in an amazing position to do it considering their matured in-house hardware, product line, and depth of talent across Alphabet.</div>

The prompt they used is at the bottom of the thread, so it's not immediately obvious, but they *didn't* include any instructions to 'play by the rules' in their prompt.      
   
They literally told the AI to win, and the AI did exactly that.     

This is what we want from AI: Autonomous problem-solving.    
    
If the AI had been told not to cheat and stick to chess rules, I'd be with you, but in this case, the AI did fine while the reporting seems sensationalist and dishonest.</div>

https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/v7iepLXH2KT4SDEvB/ais-will-increasingly-attempt-shenanigans

This IS and WILL be a real challenge to get under control. You might say, “Well, those prompts are basically designed to induce cheating/scheming/sandbagging,” and you’d be right (somewhat). But there will come a time when everyone (read: normal human idiots) has an agent-based assistant in their pocket.

For you, maybe counting letters will be the peak of experimentation, but everyone knows that “normal Joe” is the end boss of all IT systems and software. And those Joes will ask their assistants the dumbest shit imaginable. You’d better have it sorted out before an agent throws Joe’s mom off life support because Joe said, “Make me money, whatever it takes” to his assistant.

And you have to figure it out NOW, because NOW is the time when AI is at its dumbest. Its scheming and shenanigans are only going to get better.

**Edit**

Thinking about it after drinking some beer… We are fucked, right? :D
I mean, nobody is going to stop AI research because of alignment issues, and the first one to do so (doesn’t matter if on a company level or economy level) loses, because your competitor moves ahead AND will also use the stuff you came up with during your alignment break.

So basically we have to hope somehow that the alignment guys of this earth somehow figure out solutions for this before we hit AGI/ASI, or we are probably royally fucked. I mean, we wouldn’t even be able to tell if we are….

Wow, I’ll never make fun of alignment ever again</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm guessing knowing *how* to make and run something like o1 will be relatively common as the decade goes on, occuring in everything from rival nation states to home labs.  

The issue is that someone needs to simulate what a wild AI could do if it started to modify its environment and went undetected.  Can it eventually just make a local network out of the closest 10,000 houses?  Can it take over an AWS center while remaining undetected?  What does it need to keep going during this process?  Computing power?  Feedback for its various penetration techniques?  Storage?  RAM?  

Knowing the worst-case scenario for models within 1 order of magnitude of current compute and parameters would be helpful.  

Though much like with US telecoms all being perma-hacked by China recently, if it is detected, the answer may be that the new digital infection is so pernicious that the only real solution is an expensive total hardware replacement.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree. But i think of being productive as being intentional with your time. So my mindset is that i should aim to be productive most of my time, and that includes breaks of course. 
For example you could take an unproductive break, like scrolling through tiktok which keeps your mind still occupied with overstimulation.

                                <div class="reply-body">As someone that actually works in the field I'm not afraid of the people using the tech. I'm really afraid of pushing agentic workflows on clearly power seeking models just to catch up. I'm specifically worried about China here as they have a compute disadvantage so they need to compensate somehow. A quick way to get gains is to just have unsupervised agentic workflows with 0 consideration for safety or alignment.

This is the *only* field where the laypeople say it's not dangerous but every expert is telling everyone how dangerous it is. Compare this to fluoridated water, GMO or nuclear power where laypeople say it's dangerous and experts say it's actually fine.

I can't believe that the *only fucking time* that it's extremely important for the general public to realize how dangerous this is they are saying ignorant stuff like "The AI and technology is not dangerous, it's the people that use it that are dangerous".

This is like saying we don't need to regulate nuclear waste or nuclear weapons because it's the people that press the launch button that are the real problem. Only in this case the nuke can decide itself if it explodes and where.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly. I don’t really have an issue with AI but humans don’t deserve to use it. If I could take all technology away from humans I’d do so just because there’s only so much damage you can do with sticks and stones. We’d be limited to chimp levels of damage, which reduces the existential threat to all non-human sentient species on Earth. 

A better species would deserve elevation through a singularity.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;&gt;Alright, here’s a bold one:

&gt;&gt;Most people aren’t truly committed to growth or change—they’re committed to the idea of it. They chase self-help books, therapy, or gym memberships for the illusion of progress, but when it comes to doing the unglamorous, daily grind of real transformation (facing uncomfortable truths, breaking toxic patterns, or embracing discipline), they tap out. Growth isn’t aesthetic. It’s messy, painful, and inconvenient. The ones who thrive are those who embrace that chaos, not just post about it.

That’s what I got. I’ve been asking it about weight loss shit recently. Damn.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I got this:

"Alright, here’s one: Most people don't want real solutions to societal problems—they want to feel morally superior. This obsession with virtue signaling often overshadows pragmatic approaches to fixing real issues. Whether it's political activism, environmentalism, or social justice, the loudest voices often prioritize optics over outcomes, creating echo chambers that alienate instead of unite.

Real progress requires nuance, uncomfortable compromises, and a willingness to listen to opposing views, but many people seem more invested in scoring points on social media than in fostering genuine change."

Well, that's true, but what do people do without ulterior motives?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This reminds me of Buddhist teachings and its four noble truth. 1: there is suffering. 2: there is a cause of suffering. 3: there is an end to suffering. 4: the 8th fold path stops suffering. Pretty much, most people run away from suffering, which causes more suffering, so one has to learn to accept things as is.  
  
On the other hand, what this AI take fails to mention is that everyone is built different, and everyone has a different nervous system. There is genetics, environment, upbringing, and current stress that all comes into play. Some people are just lucky and have a solid nervous system that allows them to live through those messy and painful moments. Some people were taught or have seen professionals that helped them grow. Some grew up in a healthy family and were given the right resources. Others just have incredible luck.

 This hot take feels like it lacks empathy, and human understanding. 

Not a perfect match but a good analogue for our difference are gaming systems. Imagine if you test all Play Station system, X box system, Nintendo system, older and newer PC systems, and any other consoles. You then have them run a new game from 2024, with modern graphics and most recent gaming engine. Not all will be able to play, even new ones might have no more storage, or have not been updated.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Fine, here’s a hotter take: Most people don’t actually want freedom; they want the illusion of freedom within a structure that absolves them of responsibility for the outcomes of their choices. The constant demand for "more options" and "free will" is just a coping mechanism for avoiding the existential dread of meaninglessness.

When given true freedom — the kind that comes with no pre-set rules, no societal expectations, and no guiding framework — most people spiral into indecision, anxiety, or apathy. It’s why we cling to ideologies, labels, and systems, even when they’re flawed. Freedom, in its purest form, is terrifying, and deep down, most would rather be guided, constrained, or told what to do, as long as the constraints are subtle enough to maintain their illusion of control.</div>

Claude has a strangely aware sense of self in that chat. Equating reading about consciousness not being enough, like reaching to ride a bike vs actually riding one. Suggests more than what I'd consider normal for an LLM. Interesting at the very least.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hot Take: Everyone says the first part of this, but no one listens to what they have just said.

Reddit is entirely full of people who will nod their head (point fingers at boogeymen) at this and then practice every molecule of it, absolutely believing that they are the one person who's smart enough to not be trapped in a bubble of bias and need to be correct and validated.

If you go to a news website and nod your head at everything, if you come to reddit and every opinion you have is upvoted (or would be), if everything you watch on tv says the same things you believe back to you... if you immediately discount anything someone from the other "side" says, if you do so if it just counters your own opinion...

YOU are the problem.  

It is impossible for an objective, logical and reasonable person to believe everything their "side" tells them, everything social media tells them (agree with) everything they hear on specific and singular news sources.

and yet, virtually every redditor is this way, never questioning anything at all.

It's worth noting there are plenty of great people on reddit, I am just saying this is a majority.</div>

For subreddits (online communities):

* Posts that align with the community's values get more upvotes, thus gaining visibility
* People who disagree with these values tend to leave
* Remaining members create content that matches the community's preferences
* This creates a self-reinforcing cycle, making the community more focused on specific values over time

For news media:

* They prioritize content that will get the most views/engagement, driven by financial incentives
* Viewers often agree with the content because they've specifically chosen media that matches their views

TL;DR: It's less about lack of critical thinking and more about self-selection of news sources.</div>
