                        <div class="comment-body">I found a girl that I went to college with. I confirmed it was her by the birthmark on her hand, very noticeable. I had a huge crush on this girl. Great news right?

But I was faced with a dilemma. The pictures seemed like they were cell phone screen shots. and the thought crossed my mind, "what if she doesn't know they're out here?". Did I have a moral obligation to mention it, even though there were some pretty saucy implications? 

I told her I found them. "I was looking for pictures of sports, and I just happened to stumble upon this. I dont know how it happened??". She said she was really grateful. An ex of hers had posted them online and she was going through a long legal fight to get them all removed. They popped up now and again for a while, but I haven't seen them for a few years.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I learned this from a cooking YouTuber recently.  I never really appreciated the difference between canned tuna varieties in the US, but have subsequently been trying them to confirm the differences.

* “Light tuna” comes from a species called skipjack tuna, and has a very strong fishy flavor.
* “White tuna,” also known as albacore, has an extremely mild flavor.
* Yellowfin tuna has a rich meaty flavor, more flavorful than white but less fishy than light.

Enough salesman tweets from these "researchers". Release or it didn't happen.

I mean, Voice mode was a disappointment, Sora was a disappointment.

The core models are nice, but are they really advancing that much? Practically, I'm still only solving the same type of problems with AI as I did 12 months ago, despite many releases in between.

If there's a model which is a big advancement (like they claim with O3), let us test. Then we can judge. These tweets are just bullshit hype.

My general assumption is that, true to form, they will just deliver a 10% increment of actual function, with a 100% increment of additional promises and a 1000% increment of price.</div>

Imagine you have a model that can produce really good synthetic data. You also have another, or the same, model that can select the best synthetic and real data to train a new model on. You have a way to automatically create new and better models without human intervention.

That's just a simple thing. Imagine a model smart enough to modify code. It could add new features to a model that make it better, fix bugs, make it more efficient, stuff like that.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This reminds me of this post back in 2023 by Noam Brown talking about a “general version of AlphaGo” and scaling test-time compute. He was hired specifically to work on reinforcement learning at OpenAI and contributed greatly to the development of o1 (and o3 by extension). Noam literally told us what was coming in the below tweet.

https://preview.redd.it/qh4l74kbn7de1.jpeg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ca9806526538aa746bf7c88683c765958d86fb9

This kind of insight is one of the few glimpses we have into the inner workings of what are arguably the most important companies in human history. I think it’s intellectually lazy to dismiss something like this as mere hype. Every serious AI company is almost certainly working on exactly what Jason is describing here as it’s the only logical step toward creating superintelligence safely. You need an unbreakable RL environment before you even consider letting an RL optimization algorithm become ‘unstoppable.’</div>

No the test time compute scaling paradigm we literally just started hasn’t cured cancer yet, but it’s hilarious to look back and see people taking Noam’s tweet as “vague brainstorming” when Noam was literally talking about what he was working on (Q\*/Strawberry which eventually became o1)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Its interesting. From ChatGPT 4o I also got „smile“. So correct and based on the same joke. o1 did consider „smiles“ (in its summarized chain of thought) but did realize that it had 6 letters (and not realized that it could remove the s) but then chose this answer:

„A common playful answer to this riddle is “queue.” The joke goes that queue is “the longest five‐letter word” because after you pronounce the initial “Q,” the remaining four letters (“ueue”) are essentially just waiting in line—making it feel quite drawn out. Of course, in reality all five‐letter words are of equal “length,” but this riddle hinges on the quirky spelling and silent letters of queue.“

The following submission statement was provided by /u/AltKeyblade:

"Logan saw a clear daytime video of a giant USO that was dark and circular while working with the UAPTF. Lue Elizondo briefly talked about this case on the Joe Rogan Podcast and described the size of the object being bigger than an offshore oil rig going at about 450 to 550 knots underwater.

450 knots = 517mph or 833kmh underwater.

The video that Logan saw is NOT the event of the missile retrieval via helicopter in the 1990s that Lue Elizondo has also talked about (my bad). The object in the video did remind Logan of the missile story though. The video Logan saw was clear and was recorded within the past 10 years." - That UFO Podcast.

The true accomplished NoSurfers who entirely quit Reddit and other online bullshit aren't posting here to tell us all their secrets.

On the other hand I feel like reading/typing here helps me form and solidify thoughts on this topic of internet addiction that nobody in the real world cares to talk about. But I'm not entirely sure that I couldn't get the same outcome from just writing in a journal for 10-15 minutes per day.</div>

I read a comment about how there's a few power mods that mod 100s of subs.   All those subreddits tend to end up being somewhat homogeneous and similar on some level.   Similar culture, similar injokes etc reddit pop culture I guess.   So yeah that motivated me to essentially block as many of them as I could to give me a different experience when I use this website.</div>

I remember reading about a research paper / survey thing. They asked a group of people "Which is better, Mac or Windows and why?" The people that had the strongest opinions and insisted the other system had no value were the people who had only ever used one or the other. The people with the least info had the strongest opinions. People deeply familiar with both generally answered "well, it depends"</div>

Conversing with a non-sentient entity, writing clean af code on demand, generating a podcast from technical documentation, clearly explaining nuances and idioms in foreign languages, taking a picture of an ingredients list and correctly guessing what the item is, generating beautiful art based on words and themes.

                                <div class="reply-body">The problem with humanity controlling itself has nothing to do with intelligence, and everything to do with psychology. We’re surely intelligent enough to figure out an optimal strategy for self governance, but our brains are highly susceptible to all sorts of irregularities that prey on evolutionary traits that were designed for an earlier time. 

Tribalism, for instance, is a heavily influential trait that ensured man’s survival in a time when resources were scarce - but has no real place in a modern society where we’re perfectly possessing of the resources necessary to care for everyone.</div>

Democracy isnt the cause nor what's at fault - as another Redditor commented, the USA isn't an honest representation of Democracy.

I'd even argue that people not voting is a bigger part of the problem than those who do. It might seem like it's a good idea or even synonymous with freedom to have the choice to vote or not, but in practice it's closer to the opposite.

I do agree that an ASI would be able to come up with better economic practices, but the people should have the final say even if it means delaying progress.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Following inspiration from another post I saw on reddit.

The task I have been putting off for 5 months because I was unsure of how to do, was done in 5 minutes. 

Rip the band aid off. 

My worries about the what ifs and the "scaries" were all made up in my head. 

You got this. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Agree. Procrastination amplifies the severity of our "problems". I struggle with this as well. Too much planning. Too long avoiding the task/situation because of fear, the fear of the unknown. The best thing to do is just to get it done. Confront the problem. This can be applied to every aspect of life. If you sit around and think of all the trash you have to throw, the process to get it done. Getting the trash together. Putting your shoes on. Going out to the dumpster. This will take a toll on your brain and drag you down. Just get up and throw the trash. It takes 3 minutes of your time and no need for the extra brain power to do it!</div>

Now, hopefully I can find 20-50 other similar posts to take a look at or perhaps a book for me to read that will confirm the same so that I can eventually work toward ripping the band-aid off, as you say.</div>
