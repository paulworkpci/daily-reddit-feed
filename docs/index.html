                                <div class="reply-body">Hey look! 

Trump’s putting into action the Iran war plan he asked the Pentagon to whip up in 2020, then stole from the government after leaving office so he could falsely accuse General Milley of being a warmonger.

The same General Milley who stopped Trump from deploying the US military on home soil in June 2020 to gun down peaceful protesters.

It’s almost like Trump was a lying sack of fascist shit the whole time, but folks like MAGA Joe Rogan just refused to see it, and now that Trump doesn’t need to run for re-election again, the hoods are coming off and the Heil Hitlers are on full display.</div>

"They’ll start at 270,000 yuan ($37,338) and 280,000 yuan, respectively, and will be sold from April. BYD will build more than 4,000 charging stations designed to accommodate the new technology." 

They go in production already but you need the right car. They showed it off already. 

This is real but as you need other cars and new charging stations it might be a while until you can experience it.</div>

The moment they went with natural emergence instead of lab leak as the *default* explanation was the moment science walked out of the room, and political science walked in, right then and there.     

That is more than Washington and Beijing, it includes London, Paris, Moscow and Tehran, as well as every other country.  

And it does appear that the "omerta" occurred to conceal homicide, as well as to conceal from all of us that we had been made a part of a medical experiment.  

We saw how the Chinese military moved into Wuhan, building hospitals in a flash and so forth.  That wasn't a military worried about a flu outbreak - that was a military that realized that a [Dual Use Research of Concern](https://oir.nih.gov/sourcebook/ethical-conduct/special-research-considerations/dual-use-research 'Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC) is a small subset of life sciences research that, based on current understanding, can be reasonably anticipated to provide knowledge, information, products, or technologies that could be directly misapplied to pose a significant threat') experiment had gone amuck.</div>

Only a couple of months after covid hit the u.s an online documentary called plandemic was released
This documentary showed the fishmarket theory was bulshit and talked about the Wuhan lab, that fauci and the u.s were directly connected to it and also went over faucis very questionable past.

It also talked about how the death rate is severely inflated due to both covid subsidies being given out and that due to how death certificates are written anyone positive for covid is also a covid death regardless of if they died of respiratory failure or were shot in the head.

About a month after it's release it was pulled from everywhere and deemed dangerous misinformation and it would be autoremoved from youtube, reddit, facebook, pretty much any social media.

Then YEARS later. Turned out every single fucking thing that movie said was true.</div>

Sure would be harder to fake it fading off into the fog if you just have one line to hang off.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">So, which photos *might* be legit? Well, there are quite a few. 

[Early 2000s](http://ufoevidence.org/photographs/section/post2000/Photo328.htm)

[2007 Wisconsin](http://www.ufoevidence.org/photographs/section/recent/Photo416.htm)

Here are like 500 photos: [Archive 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20130408231505/http://www.ufoevidence.org/photographs/section/recent/Photo426.htm). Keep clicking 'next' to scroll through the archive, or mess around with the menu on the side to sort them. [Archive 2](https://www.ufocasebook.com/bestufopictures.html), [Archive 3](https://ufologie.patrickgross.org/htm/pics.htm), [Archive 4](https://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/category/ufos/daytime-sightings/w-photo/), [Archive 5](https://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/category/ufos/nighttime-sightings/w-photos/), [Archive 6](http://www.openminds.tv/category/articles/wendelle-stevens-archive). While I personally would not have chosen some of these photos in some of these archives as examples of what are probably genuine photos (I see a couple birds, an example of bokeh, etc), some of them are fairly clear shots depicting anomalous flying objects. 

As long as it's clear enough not to depict something prosaic, and it hasn't been proven fake, then it might be legit by default. That doesn't mean you should believe a specific one, but a bird's eye approach might be more appropriate here. All UFO imagery that has gotten any kind of attention at all comes with a debunk, but a lot of these debunks boil down to a coincidence in the case that is expected to be there if it was genuine, but it's presented as if it's not expected to be there. 

For example, the Turkey UFO footage and the released Calvine UFO photo [each have about 8 mutually exclusive debunks](https://np.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15we8rp/the_turkey_ufo_incident_debunked_as_many/jx0at70/), all based on coincidence arguments. Coincidentally it looks like this nearby mountain. Coincidentally it looks like this secret aircraft. Coincidentally, it looks like the inside of a camera lens, etc, etc. 

Similarly, the Flir1 video was [first leaked in 2007](https://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread265835/pg1). Within 2 hours, it had already been seemingly conclusively debunked as a CGI hoax. Coincidentally, it looked very similar to a then-recently admitted hoax video. Coincidentally, the footage first appeared on a shady German website. Coincidentally, the uploader was brand new to the forum, and was therefore likely to be a hoaxer. They were later criticized for poor grammar, indicating that they were likely to be Germans from that website, and the admins accused them of using multiple accounts, and using multiple accounts means you're likley to be a hoaxer, but it was a real video. Hoaxes are supposed to resemble the real thing, a real video could very well first appear on a shady German website, and a real video could very well be posted by a new user, but these three arguments were presented at the time as being unlikely to be found if it was a real video. 

So if there is a debunk, that doesn't necessarily mean it's *debunked.* You have to look at the debunk, determine if the underlying argument is based purely on a coincidence of some kind, then determine whether that coincidence is likely to be present in a genuine photograph as well. If it is, then it's not debunked. It doesn't mater if the debunker is presenting it as an unlikely coincidence. You have to figure out if it *actually is* unlikely, and it's very easy to be fooled. Probably 80-90 percent of the UFO community falls for this all the time, and yet the "gullible" label only comes in when you're believing a photograph, not when you're believing someone's misleading debunk. 

I would take the above and apply that to all of the UFO photos and videos out there. You'll find that a lot of them have misleading debunks exactly as described here, and very few people will call them out.

Try it here: the [2007 Costa Rica video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obVsLOiqeC4).  According to users in this sub [and metabunk](https://www.metabunk.org/threads/2007-costa-rica-ufo.11775/) this is debunked because the primary witness turned out to have a model making hobby. He makes little horse drawn carriages, and people claim that this means he is likely to be a hoaxer because he could have made a UFO model. If that sounds like an unlikely coincidence to you, it's not, and you need to recalibrate. Because there are [many different categories of coincidences and flaws to look for,](https://np.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/zi1cgn/while_most_ufo_photos_and_videos_can_individually/) you are likely to stumble upon at least one in a case, and sometimes you'll find up to 8 of them.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">About the Calvine photo, pretty sure that someone in metabunk reproduced the shape with a star hanging from a string (and I mean an actual photo, not a "concept" of the theory), that doesnt mean that is 100% debunked tho, and we will never know if its real or not since we only have access to one photo, when allegedly the witnesses took more photos

&gt;So if there is a debunk, that doesn't necessarily mean it's debunked. You have to look at the debunk, determine if the underlying argument is based purely on a coincidence of some kind, then determine whether that coincidence is likely to be present in a genuine photograph as well. If it is, then it's not debunked. It doesn't mater if the debunker is presenting it as an unlikely coincidence. You have to figure out if it actually is unlikely, and it's very easy to be fooled. Probably 80-90 percent of the UFO community falls for this all the time, and yet the "gullible" label only comes in when you're believing a photograph, not when you're believing someone's misleading debunk.

The point of a debunk to me its to offer a more reasonable explanation to what I see, I think "Its more likely that the Costa Rica video was fake or that the guy actually got footage of a spaceship?" 

Why? Because I ask myself "How falsifiable is what I'm seeing in the video? Can someone easily reproduce this easily or not?". If someone can easily reproduce anything I see in a video in which I dont see anything happening that is extraordinary then I go with the safer bet that its assuming the video is most likely fake.</div>

08 housing collapse peaked at **10%**.

Covid peaked at **14.7%**.

Current is **4.1%**.

The point to take away from above is that you don't need depression level unemployment.

10% is enough to "feel it" and at 15% people start going crazy.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Ah, you don't know yet how the unemployment metric is determined. It's not your fault, that's intended and only no-life nerds are familiar with it.

To be counted as unemployed you must pass through a filter of two questions: Do you have a job, and **are you looking for a job**. So if you're homeless and digging through trashcans for food? Congratulations! You're not unemployed. You're a respectable member of the workforce, is the impression they wish to create.

The metric by design cannot get very high, it's meant to be a propaganda football that doesn't mean anything.

During Trump's first run for office in 2016 he brushed it aside as 'meaningless' when Hillary tried to use the 'ole "there was a difference of 2% at sometime" trick. I laughed because I was certain he'd be using it himself to crow about his own 'accomplishments' on the economy when he was president, and he 100% did.

In good times, like the height of human affluence in the 90's, it fluctuates up and down between 8 to 12 percent. It never means anything. (Uncle Ray uses the participation rate, since it's a more objective measure of real employment.)

The current ~3% or whatever it's floating around is actually *extremely abnormal* and *extremely bad*. It doesn't indicate that more people are holding down jobs, it means more people have given up on a job as a means for bettering their situation. That more people have given up on having a family.

The world doesn't end at 100% unemployment. It ends at 0% unemployment.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Remember what Curtis Yarvin, greatest JD Vance's inspiration said:

Poor, unproductive individuals [should be turned into biodiesel](https://www.yahoo.com/news/where-j-d-vance-gets-100000608.html)

That's, essentially, how they (billionaires) view regular people. They don't give a damn if you're employed or not, or about your fate in general. They don't care about anyone, except themselves. That's why they're busy dismantling social security and other perks of the democratic society. They intend to undermine democracy totally, concentrating power and wealth in the hands of a privileged few. If the current administration isn’t removed soon—potentially even by force—the future for everyday Americans looks bleak, to say the least. I can't stress enough just how much everyone should pay attention to what's going on in the US these days.</div>

The damage happens long after you put your phone down.

This past month I've been struggling to focus and reach my daily goals. I spent more time watching IG Reels.

I started to notice that:

* It was more difficult to focus on tasks
* I was much more easily distracted
* It was harder to commit to a task
* I didn't feel like doing anything productive

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean, this is already kind of happening in real life.

Tesla is in real trouble.  ...by any technical analysis the stock is massively overvalued and Musk's moonshot persona has been the only thing boosting its valuation.  Just the reputational damage he's done to himself alone this past few months has caused serious damage to the brand.  Sales are down, prospects are down and the brand has completely lost whatever cache it had with its customer base.  The "do gooder" vibe is completely smashed and the brand may not be recoverable in Canada and most of Western Europe, both of which are key markets.  

I'd say that at current he's cruising toward disaster as is.  Turning the screw more really isn't super necessary, the current boycotts and bad feelings are doing their job.  ...and Tesla's valuation is the base upon which Musk's future prospects rest, it's the engine powering his other ventures.</div>

Social medias want you paranoid and afraid to keep you hooked, you’re better off finding interests elsewhere.</div>

Sells a training plan. Watching a film critic? Sells memberships to longer videos. Watching a language aficionado? Sells a course. Sell sell sell. Always. So I just turned the TVs and monitors off, and opened my window to watch trees and listen to birds. Nature is not selling me anything.</div>

Where I learned my lesson was with the news, and that was back in like 2014. I was just swallowing and swallowing, and I got perpetually freaked out when I listened to the conspiracy stuff. Eventually I figured out that listening to that stuff did nothing to improve my life. If there was something actually important someone would end up telling me about it anyway. Fretting about it only took away from my mental hit points when they could go to something actually useful.


Just to say it, the news is like 20x worse then when I quit watching it. This shit now makes Alex Jones look sane, and I'm not exactly exaggerating.</div>

Some houses aren't connected to any Internet providers even if the neighbors are connected and even if an Internet provider incorrectly says the house is connected. If they need to connect cable or fiber to your house, that can cost tens of thousands of dollars.</div>

Now that I am self-employed, I go to bed wayy too late, sleep in too much, and although I get my stuff done, I have no structure to my days lol.

When you know you have the option to not do things (especially boring things), it becomes easy to not do them.</div>

I remember seeing a similar conversation years ago, and someone said that this is why elderly folks age so rapidly after retirement, because they lose the structure work gave them, which leads to a domino effect of physical and cognitive decline due to the lack of purpose that would ignite those functions. 

It’s even seen in people that are in high performing fields, like sports. Once they retire or stop playing (i.e. high school, D1 college), theres usually a huge downward spiral if they don’t find something meaningful to replace that with.</div>

Having a 9-5 ensures that you are accountable for things in your life. Plus, if you want to do something else outside of those hours, you have to be quite strict in your time management. Basically, accountable to yourself outside of work.</div>

Lmfao, posting on social media is not speaking out. I voted against him 3 times, which on average is way better than the people who voted for him at least once or didn’t vote. I donated money as well. Following and getting angry over every tiny horrible thing he does DOESN’T actually help any of the people he is hurting. 

Vote, donate, volunteer, but don’t obsess over every little thing. Do your part, but remember you can’t save a country from drowning when they are actively swimming towards the bottom.</div>
