                <div class="post-content">As human beings, we are cursed with blindspots and biases, but at the same time, we are blessed with pattern recognition. 

Externalizing is the antidote to those limitations; instead of thinking about it and doing it right now, write it out and track it over time. 

You’ll end up with a pool of data that captures what you do AND the recurring mistakes that you make, which you can now spot. 

**Track:** 

Tracking and journaling are the holy grail of externalizing. Track your mood, energy levels...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">spot on. tracking and externalizing are legit game changers. it’s easy to feel stuck when everything’s just swirling around in your head. writing stuff down forces you to see patterns and make connections you wouldn’t notice otherwise.

journaling and regular reviews are underrated too—literally just taking 10-15 minutes a day to reflect can save you from repeating the same mistakes over and over. it doesn’t have to be deep—just basic check-ins like “what went well?” and “what sucked?” are enough to spot trends.

same goes for tracking stuff like sleep, mood, or screen time—it’s wild how just seeing the data can make you rethink habits. you can’t fix what you’re not aware of, and tracking makes it impossible to ignore.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yup, just realised this after I looked at my workout routine.


For the longest time I felt like I was working out quite hard, but I was making minimal gains. Luckily I have very detailed records of every single workout I have done and after I went through the data I realised I was only working out 2 days/week on average. Now that I have made a conscious decision to work out 4 days/weeks I am seeing significant improvements. 


This made me think I am probably making this exact same mistake in a lot of other areas of my life and I should start tracking things more meticulously if I want to make sustained progress.</div>

I believe they serve as the primary influence that brainwashes people or causes them distress, even if they do not initially realize it. These comments essentially erode every aspect of critical thinking and condition individuals to rely on others for answers. This is why, when we encounter a post that we either like or dislike, we are already subconsciously trained to anticipate a counterargument in the replies or expect affirmation of...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Completely agree. This is something I have thought about but not as deeply as you described - interesting stuff! Personally, for years I was the biggest comment reader and it undoubtedly affected my critical thinking skills negatively. For example, I would see a video of something controversial (e.g a thief getting beat up savagely by a bystander) and before I would make up my own opinion about it and actually think about MY values and what I think is just and unjust, I would instantly open up the comments before the vid was finished and read as many as I could in 30 seconds, and then typically I would agree with the comments with the highest likes... it's embarrassing to admit, but its the truth. Now I have quit almost all social media, and I certainly won't be checking comments in the future, for what its worth...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There are two types of people :

The first type will watch the video you mentioned and, due to having weak defense mechanisms, will likely conform to the most prevalent opinion. Even if they originally thought differently.



The second type will be more inclined to think for themselves, and because of that, they are more likely to experience distress when confronted with such perspectives. 



This is why I have always believed that if you use social media and it has never bothered you, then the brainwashing has probably worked. There’s no real clash between what you stand for and what you believe and what social medias feeds you. You are basically giving in .


while If social media causes you distress, it is your brain’s way of trying to protect you from what’s in it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Agreed. I honestly think the comments section would not be as bad if all these platforms removed the default view of sorting by the "best" comment, aka highest like/upvote count.


Back when forums were prevalent you typically needed to read every single comment in a thread before coming to any conclusion since replies were sorted by timestamp, this is more in step with how actual conversations and debates flow. Its not perfect but is definitely a little more human and feels less like you're being spoon fed the "correct" interpretation or opinion.</div>

You are rewarded with the most visibility if your comment has the most likes, even if it contributes nothing meaningful to the discussion. It buries diversity of thought. Not to mention, with the way that people are unable to disagree with others in a healthy and respectful way and how quickly the conversation devolves into bullying.... The internet is a scary place. Fewer connections are made nowadays. Instead, we have struggle sessions and fights. It is so depressing and lonely...</div>

Another edit: I actually used a local model (Gemma 3 12b) to come up with the voice style prompts and text above, by saying I needed them for a voice coaching class.

Oh im sure, all women want a tampon fucked into their cervix so they can have it medically removed.... 

In ireland now, he has a new name on social media: "Andrew Tayto".

Tayto is the leading brand of potato chips in ireland. and now there are memes of Andrew tayto with flavors like "Assault and Vinegar" (instead of "Salt and Vinegar"), or "Cokey Bacon" (instead of "Smokey Bacon").

Basically, McGregor's reputation is less than dog shit in ireland.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">But Yann literally has a book-long track record of making statements that turned out to be hilariously wrong. From "Self-supervised learning will solve everything", "CNNs is all you need for vision" to "Transformers will not lead anywhere and are just a fad" (before they exploded)" and "Reinforcement learning is a dead end" before we combined RL and LLMs.

I even got banned from one of his live stream events when he argued that LLMs are at their limit and basically dead because they can't control how long they take to solve a problem. I responded with, "Well, how about inventing one that can?"  This was two months before o1 was released, proving that LLMs are far from dead.

Being a brilliant researcher in one domain doesn't automatically make someone infallible in predicting the future of AI.

What he's saying here isn't research, it's an opinion. And opinions, especially about the future of AI, are just that: opinions. He cannot know for sure, nor can he say with scientific certainty that LLMs will never reach AGI. That's not how science works.

Even more influential figures in the field, like Hinton, have made predictions that go in the exact opposite direction. So if LeCun's authority alone is supposed to settle the argument, then what do we do when other AI pioneers disagree? The fact that leading experts hold radically different views should already be a sign that this is an open question, not a settled fact. And I personally think answering open questions like they are already solved is probably the most unscientific thing you can do. So I will shit on you, even if you are Einstein. 

At the end of the day, science progresses through empirical results, not bold declarations. So unless LeCun can provide a rigorous, peer-reviewed proof that AGI is fundamentally impossible for LLMs, his claims are just speculation and opinions, no matter how confidently he states them, and open for everyone to shit on.

                                <div class="reply-body">Just to reiterate the Singularity hypothesis for the 1000th time:

yes, we can't *just* double data.  But we can do what humans have done so many other times, and start with something that works and *tweak* it.  For example we 'just' tweaked silicon ICs over 50 years to reach this point, we never did find anything better and still essentially use lithography.

test-time compute is a tiny *tweak* on LLMs.  So are many of the other recent improvements.

  
Second, we don't *have* to make it all the way to 'true AGI' whatever that is.  We *just* have to find enough tweaks - at this point, it seems less than 5-10 tweaks - to get an AI system capable of doing most of the work of AI research, and then we just order that system to investigate *many* more possibilities until we find something truly worthy of calling it "AGI".  There are *many* variations on neural networks we have never tried at scale.</div>

Did you actually try sticking with one sleep routine for some time? Like going to bed at the same time and waking up at the same time for three to four weeks without any exceptions?

Also having coffee at least one hour after you wake up and not later than 10 hours before you go to bed makes a huge difference.</div>

“What did my wife ask me to buy at the store”
“What time did I say I was meeting Jim”
“What does this sign say in English”
“What’s the part number of this thing”

The biggest hurdle is the privacy nightmare it creates. I know we are all going to have personal AI assistants very soon, I just don’t know how companies are going to sell it in a way that people are comfortable with it. But just like we give away all our data now, the use cases are going to be too compelling to ignore.</div>

[Model](https://huggingface.co/manycore-research/SpatialLM-Llama-1B)

[Code](https://github.com/manycore-research/SpatialLM)

[Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/manycore-research/SpatialLM-Testset)

**SpatialLM** **is a** **3D large language model** **designed to process 3D point cloud data and generate structured 3D scene understanding outputs**. These outputs include architectural elements like walls, doors, windows, and oriented object bounding boxes with their semantic categories. Unlike previous methods that require specialized equipment for data collection, SpatialLM can handle point clouds from diverse sources such as monocular video sequences, RGBD images, and LiDAR sensors. This multimodal architecture effectively bridges the gap between unstructured 3D geometric data and structured 3D representations, offering high-level semantic understanding. **It enhances spatial reasoning capabilities for applications in embodied robotics, autonomous navigation, and other complex 3D scene analysis tasks**.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly, the humanoid element at this point seems more of a way to distract people from the fact that these robots still aren't able to do anything we actually want them to do.

If a robot was on wheels but could dust, fold clothes, cook dinner, wash dishes, etc., it would be great. Hell, even a stationary robot that could do those would be great. Yet we’re seeing all these robots that can’t do any of that, but they can walk around in order to…more easily access locations where they can’t do anything.

The problem is that the human mind sees something that acts human in one particular way and starts to assume that it has other human characteristics. “It can do a handstand and summersault, so we’re almost to the point where it can wash dishes!”

It’s very likely all of this cool locomotion is the low hanging fruit, and getting the robots to do useful things is going to be a much longer and much more difficult process.</div>

                <div class="post-content">If you (or another person) wrote on something with a sharpie and you need to remove it, try Lysol spray. I’ve used it on plastic containers, countertops, and even glossy book/magazine covers. 

You can spray Lysol on a paper towel and then wipe the offending writing away, or depending on the surface you can spray directly on the writing and then wipe it off with paper or cloth. 

As with most cleaning methods, try a small spot first. </div>

The expo marker trick is probably the best for your buck though. In the reverse of this, you could theoretically use printer ink (which is stored in methanol) or also use butanol, which is hard to come as anything but a chemistry business.</div>

delete the apps  
buy a dumb phone  
track screen time  
set timers

it all feels productive  
but why do so many relapse after a week?

because the root issue isn’t the apps  
it’s the mindset behind why you’re escaping in the first place

most ppl are avoiding boredom  
avoiding discomfort  
avoiding facing their actual life  
so they jump from one numbing behavior to the next  
scrolling → netflix → news → junk food

truth is, you’re right—you *can* get scattered pieces of wisdom anywhere  
but most ppl scroll endless advice, random threads, AI quotes, and stay stuck cuz they drown in info

nofluffwisdom filters that noise  
zero theory loops  
no motivation porn  
just sharp reminders to stop consuming and actually apply

whether that benefits my pocketbook or not doesn't change the fact most ppl spend years hoarding advice instead of acting

but hey, do what works  
scroll chatgpt threads forever, or pick something consistent that cuts through the junk

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm with OP in that 'dopamine detoxes' are largely bunk science and finding true equilibrium or a sustainable relationship with internet/hobbies/whatever takes a lot of hard and intensely personal work. It takes a drive to change the paradigm and a gameplan to do it in a smart way that works for you, the individual.

Where OP loses me is how some newsletter is going to magically fix things. There's no magic bullet solution, and definitely no newsletter that is going to snap someone struggling with these problems onto a better path. If there was, everyone and their mother would be using it. It would be common knowledge.

Posts like these, clearly advertising some paid service, really skeeve me out.

Anyone reading this should know that if they're going to spend money, they should spend that money talking to a qualified therapist or another professional. This isn't it.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/Shiny-Tie-126:

---

Catastrophic disclosure in the UAP context means a sudden, uncontrolled unveiling of proof that extraterrestrial life or technology exists. Unlike a phased approach, it would hit society cold, risking fear, economic turmoil, and distrust, driven by triggers like leaks, mass sightings, or botched announcements. Its “catastrophic” tag stems from potential upheaval—panic, market crashes, belief crises—exacerbated by misinformation. UAP debates split on its inevitability versus manageability, with some seeing a slow reveal already unfolding. Outcomes could range from chaos to discovery, reshaping science, unity, and philosophy long-term. Preparation, from personal awareness to global planning, could temper its impact, making the unknown less daunting.

In a lot of ways the modern establishment is similar to the early catholic church pushing back on basic truths like the sun-centered model even when presented with rock-hard scientific evidence.

In more recent times, Covid lockdowns showed us how non-resilient humanity is to change or disruption.

We have centuries of circumstantial evidence that we are being visiting by NHI and yet the topic remains viewed as fringe. The sum of all of the circumstantial evidence should be just as good as physical proof and yet still no one cares.

It’s going to take a generation of NHI living out in the open along side of us before it becomes seen as mainstream or normal. We are way too rigid as a species.</div>

The people who have conditioned the public against the truth and lied to them constantly now consider their own successful deceptions and the shock that would result from their being revealed its own justification against telling the truth, like the sort of logic a deranged serial killer would come up with.

The solution is to have a plan and get it over with, since it's well understood in psychology that irrational fear and anxiety improve through exposure, and there can be no greater exposure to the fear of the unknown than "catastrophic" disclosure, which would serve as the most potent anxiolytic possible in the long term.</div>

Reminds me of the narcissist's prayer:

That didn't happen.
And if it did, it wasn't that bad.
And if it was, that's not a big deal.
And if it is, that's not my fault.
And if it was, I didn't mean it.
And if I did, you deserved it.</div>
