It’s kinda the same way I am with a few friends and family members who are still backing the shit that’s happening. I still think they are the people I have always known and not bad people deep down (but you know, people are always surprised by the arrest of a serial killer sooo lol). They obviously bought some bullshit they shouldn’t have and that sucks pretty bad. But I feel that way about them from a distance.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Eh, i get how this can be a thing. I work in a smallish office with a few older ladies. I've been their go to for computer questions and problems for a long time, and they've been very kind and generous giving me birthday gifts. Sometimes they annoy the hell out of me, but mostly I don't mind being a source of help and certainly don't think they need to "reimburse" me by giving me a birthday gift (and I only phrase it as such bc usually they comment on me being helpful, or have given me like a sbux gift card on a rare occasion when I've really helped them out of a bind). So, they get birthday gifts from me. As someone else commented, we spend a lot of time with these people. It's a weird sort of intimacy to hear someone sneeze and go "that's Elizabeth, there will be exactly two more" or "oh shit, Carolyn is coming, I can hear her footsteps and I know it's her", etc. For better or worse, we are big chunks of each other's lives so it feels appropriate to recognize their birthdays. I don't think that always applies, I think its situational, but ive worked in places where it's super normal and where it would be super strange. </div>

My younger brother Ben is 29 and lives with an ultra-rare condition called TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy. Over the years, he lost the ability to speak, walk, and use his hands. For a long time, there was no reliable way for him to communicate—most commercial tech just didn’t work.

I think most people leap to innovation can only be from certain people and has to be groundbreaking stuff. 

But, AI lets average people solve some (usually relatively simple) problems that were just never profitable to research and develop.

I'm so impressed with what this family is doing and getting the word out there.

It honestly can't be overestimated what people can do with even just a simple HTML5 front end, or a microcontroller and some basic electronics that no one would think of without their contexts and life experience.

Throw in the increasing ease of 3D printing in and we are going to be seeing some amazing stuff coming out of some people with no coding skills I believe.</div>

I had tried to make a game and GPT5-thinking kept running into walls, Gemini 2.5 pro easily fixed all of the issues.

I think Gemini 3.0 pro will be SOTA, unless maybe if they release Claude 4.5 Opus :P</div>

I guess they do hierarchical generation through time maybe? So the segment can fail to match the end of a segment with the start of the next one sometimes.</div>

Still of course mighty impressive. The blooper[ reel video](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nvuqe7/sora_2_launch_film_blooper_reel/) is mindblowing.</div>

Jaguar is rebranding because it wasn’t exactly doing great beforehand. Eg how many people do you know even knew about the XE existing let alone would consider it if they were shopping for a 3 series or Cclass? The F-Type is IMO one of the best looking cars ever and sounds great - how well did sell? The F-pace looked great too for an SUV but same story. 


They haven’t even released a new car under the rebrand and yet everyone is tripping over themselves to say how much it failed. 

I’m not saying it’ll for sure succeed but the revisionism for the past is wild.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is by far the top answer, and such a shame. My dad worked at Jaguar for a time and there was absolutely a time when it was populated with engineers who were truly passionate about the cars and what they could do. It was during my dad's tenure though that the middle management started to really take over the shop and even the cool shit the engineers were churning out ended up kneecapped by management decisions. I visited my dad in New Zealand last year and he STILL talks about some of the shit he went through before he quit LOL.

But yeah... for a while there with the XF, XE and even the I-Pace where Jaguar looked like they were really back to creating genuinely good (if occasionally flawed) cars that would have appealed to those old engineers. Then... they stopped making cars (LONG before the cyberattack) and became... whatever the fuck they think they became. I literally feel like they became the automotive equivalent of vibe coders who don't understand the code enough to troubleshoot it and just ship it.</div>

I am team Subaru, but I love Lancers just the same now. I realized that both are united now in a world that seems to only want SUVs. As I drive around in my WRX, the few Lancers I see get a wave cuz we’re in this together as echoes of a lost age. Like the few remaining dinosaurs after the extinction event.</div>

Losing jobs is one thing. Losing shared grounding on what is base reality is another. Partisan news ain't got nothing on the billion splintered ideas of what is 'real'

Also I question the sense in AI companies, first Meta and now OpenAI, creating a Cocomelon for adults.

Moonbug focus tests their cartoons in front of groups of children for maximum attention, any time children look away from the TV showing the cartoon to another dubbed the 'distractotron' a note is made and the cartoon is edited to be more engaging. [(yes this is real)](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisingkids/comments/v46l9f/moonbugs_cocomelon_leaves_nothing_to_chance_an/ib2jdrb/)

 having a fully automated algorithmically generated feed of the most eye catching brainrot AI can create is going to have deleterious effects. This is obvious to call now. This is not going to be some big surprise. They are designing for this.</div>

Agreed. So now we're entering the viral stage, where AI videos will flood human culture like nothing we've ever seen - because that's what it's about: ever-better novelty. 

Very soon algorithms will be generating the latest novel content, based on clicks and views. A race to the bottom?

So do we turn our eyes away, or gaze into The Medusa?</div>

We used to believe scarcity was the problem for Survival. It turns out it is Abundance: of cheap calories, porn, sex, drugs, distractions, god knows what else...

For those who are feeling overwhelmed or even for practising self preservation, one of the best things you can do is get out walking.. on a long hike, even better on a multi day walking pilgrimage... it will break your modern conditioning after a few days allowing you to think more freely about what is important and your priorities in leading a sane life.</div>

Hamas is a jihadist organisation. There is no peace to be found with jihadists. In my view that’s all one needs to know about it. Every member of Hamas signed their death certificate on October 7.

                <div class="post-content">I find being *dead serious* about consistency in mindfulness, or any discipline in general is a great way to make your practice into a chore. 

I know a good amount of people who never managed to enjoy mindfulness due to *this one* aspect, and I experienced it as an issue in my own practice a few years ago.

It's so much better to focus on *being a meditator*, rather than pressuring yourself to get into the practice. Allowing mindfulness to become part of **you**, not your **routine** is the key...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hard disagree. 

A meditator is someone who meditates. If you want to get into meditation, you will need to meditate. Consistently. 

Meditating once every few days or once a week, while it will provide some benefit and is better than nothing, will provide far less benefit compared to meditating every day.

What's better: meditating once per day for 5 minutes, or once per week for 35 minutes? 

Meditation is not a chore. Consistently meditating is not a chore. Like anything else it is a habit.

Read Atomic Habits if you have problems with instilling habits and sticking to them.

----

In a nut shell, all you need to do is decide to start meditating after some event you already do consistently. For example perhaps after dinner, you will floss, then brush your teeth, then sit down to meditate. 

To start, literally go meditate for 1 minute, and then get up and doom scroll on tiktok or whatever you do.

After 2-3 days then increase it to 5 minutes. After 7 days maybe double it to 10 minutes, and so on and so forth.

If there is some day that you have a hectic schedule and cannot meditate after dinner, the key thing to remember is that you are going to sit down and meditate even if you only do it for 5 seconds. 

Your body acts on inertia. If you do it this way you will keep the inertia up and it will be trivially easy to consistently meditate.</div>

I love functional fitness, and CrossFit programming is perfect for what I want to do. However, after trying 4 different gyms, I'm struggling with the group class format. They feel rushed (next class is always waiting), and I end up feeling like I'm not getting optimal training time. I also don't always want to train at the high intensity that typically comes with CrossFit—a few days a week, I'd prefer to swap the WOD for s...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">What are your goals? 

Did group classes exclusively for about 1 year. Switched to a solo competitive program and now workout by myself. I’ll hop into class sometimes. I’m also a coach so I still am involved. We use PRVN. 

I made the switch because I wanted to get better competitively and I needed to make personalized adjustments to my training to keep improving. That and doing CrossFit type intensity classes 5 days a week is not good for gains. Need that zone 2 and accessory work. But it’s not fun so it’s not programmed. 

I tell my group class members this all the time: 

Eventually, you’ll reach a point where if you want to improve on something you’ll need to put in extra workout outside of class. Even just 15min before or after to work on something makes a huge difference. That’s how I learned a lot of skills. We all hit a wall somewhere. As a coach, I can only give so much time and attention to each member in a big class. And while you can make a TON of progress just going to class, sometimes you gotta put in extra work or just accept where you’re at. 

Unfortunately finding boxes that have open gym to allow independent training are tough to find! Good luck 👍.</div>

What I learned is that giving reasons often invites negotiation.

Even if there are valid reasons, people will still try to argue or debate you to try to find some crack in your logic to get you to cave.  It’s right in OPs example.  Oh you have prior obligations?

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, I was gonna say this too. 

So many things I read like this lack practical context. For instance, recently I was looking into crossing the border and other travellers said border guards were going through their phones. But the internet told me if my phone was shut off, or if I had Face ID disabled, I was allowed to refuse to open it for them. 

In real life, what would happen? Maybe it’d be fine, but maybe they’d sit me there for 6 hours, or turn me away because there’s a certain amount of subjectivity at the border. Do I risk it if I have nothing to hide? 

Just because it might be true doesn’t mean you avoid the nuanced consequences of your actions in a fluid society.</div>
