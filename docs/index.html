                                <div class="reply-body">True, and also, it does not matter how shit Orion is. Even if training is harder and is slowing down, just do even more compute. It's compute all the way down. It will take longer, but it will still work. We are at a breaking point, where compute will get so cheap, that AI will be able to generate enough economically valuable work that it will self sustain development of new chips and mass manufacturing of chips.

If GPT5 needs to be 1 000x bigger instead of 100x bigger (like with difference between gpt-3 vs gpt-4), then that is only a single gen of GPU. If GPT5 needs to be 10 000 bigger, then it will be delayed by 2 generations of GPU. And that extra time can be spent on perfecting the model, fine tuning and to actually give some extra time for the robot manufacturing to catch up to speed of development of AI, as currently AI is vastly outpacing how fast can we build robots.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Nah it means that orion is not the base model. Tbh I'm a bit surprised since the cost of full o3 is huge so it would be logical for it to be a multi-trillion model.

I think it's rumored that o1 was used to generate synthetic data for orion, which in turn was used to make synthetic data for o3 (but with more detailed knowledge since it's a huge model).

We'll likely never see orion or a finetuned orion as a customer product. It is likely very slow and costly and doesn't score high on benchmarks like the reasoning models.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Cost per token didn't really change.  They just cranked the compute dial to 11 which churns through tokens.

"just" is a gross oversimplification, but the point is that the raw cost per token did NOT change significantly from o1.

But to your main point, RE: internal models used solely to improve release candidate models -- This feels like a great way for OpenAI to benefit immediately from models without needing to wade through 6 months of adversarial red team testing.  When only OpenAI employees can prompt it, you can start using it productively much quicker.</div>

People aren't asking for implementations, but defining what this 'leaked' strawberry is - so all the bs around it can stop, or defining what 'leaked' orion is.... what the rough architecture is of o1+ , whether it truly is a multimodal LLM  all on it's own - like no other augmentations, apis or subsystems (bc would that still qualify as just a LLM?).  Some very basic and general definitions/information would be so nice. It gives me a headache af to read everyone expounding on these things in this state of limbo.

I have been gifted scratchers before that won small amounts and the thought of giving any back was never even on the radar. It’s a gift. You gave it away. If it was conditional on it only being yours if you lost, it was a really shitty gift. </div>

Not that I’m one to buy lottery tickets, but I would not be offended if someone won but and didn’t return anything. A gift is a gift, once you give it, it’s theirs.</div>

	•	Working out 4 times a week, including gym or studio classes.

                        <div class="comment-body">Some things that have worked for me:

On the days I don’t workout, I try to do something else productive during that time usually at a coffee shop. I basically aim for the same routine 5 days a week. Recently I’ve been brushing up on job interviews.

I also kind of accept that after 40-50/week + workouts + chores + downtime + socializing, I’m not doing anything else big on weekdays.

Sundays is when I do most my non-day job “work”. I plan my week, spend a few hours on something (e.g. side project), do my chores, and try to have a good chunk of down time in the evening. 

Not burning myself out during the weekdays helps feel ok “working” Sundays, and I sometimes skip it if needed. 

Pacing my work, planning my weeks and my days, and doing strategies like the other commenter suggesting with 50/10min are all things I do that help be productive without running myself to the ground.

Finally, plan on longer scales of time. Either quarterly or I like thirds (4 month period.) Year long plan is too far out imo. Understand your bigger goals and plan accordingly. You can’t focus 100% on everything all at once, but you can shift focus to different areas at different times. If you plan the longer scale, you’ll feel comfortable accepting that. For example, this past August I did a lifting competition, so July-Aug was focused on lifting. Big work deadline in Sept, so I went all in on that, working a few 50-60 hour weeks. Then took a week Vacation. Then went harder on side project while both workouts and my day jobs were more chill.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It has mostly to do with the fact LLMs can't see the grid the way we see it since text appears linear to them and also they have to draw the final grid manually to solve the tasks, quite a few of the failures were straight up wrong grid size but the logic itself was dead on. We humans mostly ignore the grid unless we're using it for alignment which is why grid size matters little to us. 

Imagine how difficult it would be to solve these problems if you were blind and had to rely on someone else telling you the color for each square on the grid 1 by 1 and at the end you had to say your solution out loud square by square</div>

Biological brains have visual cortex as an accelerator. For LLMs to do well with visual tasks I think something like this needs to be developed, or maybe not if the compute is there that it can "brute force" it.</div>

What they probably need to do is give them the ability to zoom in on sections of the image while somehow keeping the full context in mind. "This is a horse, this is its hoof, this is a nail in that hoof."</div>

You dislike him (probably for a silly reason like bias politics), you want him to fail, to lose money and yet, that man did an end around, enlisting investors to pay for it all.

That said, I guess you can feel better and superior knowing that all these companies and rich people investing are clearly dumb and not smart like you, I mean, it's Elon, he's an idiot and a failure... why would anyone sane or smart invest in anything he does.  

Lol, fails all around right?</div>

By ‘forever’, you must mean six months, tops. Or do you truly believe that society gets frozen in amber the instant one country reaches AGI?

This is why I am so optimistic about the future. Our clueless, no-intuition having overlords think just like this. They think they’re building the road to eternal domination rather than digging the grave for their hegemony. These people are so goddamn stupid, and unlike with nuclear weapons there won’t be an oopsie-daisy where these useless clowns get to remain in charge after screwing things up with their primitive monkey urges like ‘control of resources’ and ‘loyalty of thralls’ and ‘expansion of territory’. It’s so hilarious!!

Time-wasters like social media and video games used to be much easier for me, even though being productive was much better for me, and i never understood why until about a year ago when i learned what i'm about to share with you.

This allowed me to WANT to work on my business, and helped me to finally overcome distractions after trying for so long.

UFO/Drone Sighting Over White Sands NASA Testing Facility in NM

Time: 9:16 12/24/24
Location: Las Cruces, NM

This was an unidentified flying object sighting here in Las Cruces, New Mexico, 12/24/24 9:16. On the other side of the mountain range behind these is one of the largest weapons testing facilities in the United States the White Sands missile range. I often see a lot of stuff overhead, but not usually in the vain of UFOs. Usually, I see missiles or stuff like that. This was definitely different. My mom spotted it when she was coming back from taking my grandfather home. They seem to be moving relatively slowly off into the horizon towards the north. The land past us in that direction belongs to the NASA testing facility, which is associated with the white sands testing facility on the other side of the mountain. There were several dozen of these flying off into the horizon in formation.

The orbs are dismantling all the nukes in the world, silently and methodically. Their presence remains a mystery, and no one knows their true origin or purpose. No one will disclose it: not the US, not China, not Russia, not any nation. Each government only knows about itself—that their nuclear arsenals have vanished without a trace—but they are completely in the dark about whether the same has happened to others.

They don’t seem to intervene in day to day suffering. Perhaps it’s about peace, but nukes aren’t necessarily about Peace. Nukes do something to more than impact humans. Nations become incentivized to invent much more locally violent options. Cheaper. Smarter. Better at killing folks.
