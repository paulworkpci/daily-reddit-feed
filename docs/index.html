Even now we're seeing more and more manuals paywalled behind higher or top trims.</div>

I really feel like manuals are about done, outside of some niche applications and low end cars in some markets. I'm half sad since that's what I grew up with and I appreciate the experience, but I also recognize that the world is moving on and that modern ICE cars aren't exactly that same experience anyway.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I recently scanned a bunch of drawings I made as a child. Some of these are more than 20 years old. I thought it'd be interesting to see what Sora could do with these. Most of the images took a few tries to get right. I was surprised how well the cat turned out. I had more trouble with the alien world, where it kept adding wheels to the flying cars and just ignored their design. Still pretty cool!

Nobody trusts Meta's AI (which is also pretty useless), ChatGPT is getting a reputation as the loser's AI companion, and Google is flooding the zone with placing Gemini everywhere and in everything to the point that it's an absolute nuisance (even if I think Gemini is fine).

Claude, on the other hand, has always stayed in its lane and has been consistently useful for many people across many fields. I hope Anthropic continues to lean into this and doesn't fall prey to the gimmicks (voice mode) or start encroaching on territory that should *always* belong to humans (art, film, therapy, etc). Just let it be a helpful and knowledgeable assistant that can streamline my workflow and I'll be eternally grateful.</div>

However, this is wrong. Confident people are very often not exceptional or even above average in all sorts of areas.. What separates them from insecure people isn’t necessarily their skill, or success, or attractiveness. It’s their contentment with themselves.

                        <div class="comment-body">You don’t magically gain confidence. You gain it by doing something you enjoy and are good at, this creates confidence in yourself. You can’t just become content with yourself just by thinking it.  For example you go to the gym and show you have discipline and consistence, once you are able to realise that, you will gain confidence, which will also make you content with yourself. 

It is in a way a result of success, whatever your personal success is, for one person it’s achieving their career, their physique, their instrument etc… 

People who are average at something and confident doesn’t meant they have the best cards, just that they understand they can only play with the cards they have, and they still do that to their best of their ability.</div>

CC always guesses random shit, i even have instructions in my CLAUDE.md that tell it to always check the .env file for the database credetnials, or application port, then it guesses database names, passwords, etc.  to be clear i it doesn't have access to production, only a test system with test data, and i take frequent backups.

as far as debugging, i find it's a toss up, sometimes i find one much better than the other i normally just stick with one for a while, then it gets stuck (i do /clear or /new frequently), and i switch to the other and resolve the issue.</div>

If you ask them to do a task, they'll be able to do it to some reasonable degree already, even if not amazing or perfect. This provides a signal for that task, or the steering you mentioned. If you generate multiple such task attempts, the model itself can synthesize its previous attempts into a better attempt (based on errors, inconsistencies, etc. that it identifies).

The steering is then rewarding the model for producing these better answers in one attempt.

You do highlight an important point though, which we discuss in our limitations section:
&gt; CaT depends on the initial policy to meaningfully estimate reference answers; for weak base models or completely unknown/genuinely novel domains, synthesis may fail to produce improvements.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes, improving without labels doesn't imply arbitrary improvement. Instead, what we see is that: policy improves --&gt; estimated reference improves --&gt; policy improves... until the delta between the policy and the estimated reference is negligible. This happens when the policy's outputs become less diverse, and tend to agree more as the model improves. That's when CaT can't take advantage of differences between outputs to produce better reference estimates any more. We describe this in more technical detail in Appendix B :)

In our future work section, we suggest a few ways of trying to shift this limit further by sampling more diverse rollouts and using exploration rewards.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Normal behavior from comedians would be that because Charlie Kirk is "off-limits" that they'd all be one-upping another with over-the-top and crass jokes about him. Usually they take "you aren't allowed to say X" as a personal affront and challenge. And even if some of the jokes aren't even that funny, there's a joy in going over the line. You'd think, in normal times, that Comedy Mothership would be non-stop jokes at Kirk's expense.

The charitable explanation is that it's because comedians themselves all have podcasts these days and in some ways fear violence and so feel more of a kinship with Kirk. But I don't rule out other explanations, either.</div>

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If Donald Trump went on TV and said “I didn’t kill Charlie Kirk” would you think to yourself?  

Why tf are you telling us that?  
Why would you feel the need to say that at all?  

Is it because you don’t know that one tweet on X existed?  

Did you think Charlie wouldn’t tell anyone at all?  

If no else will say it, I will.  Israel is responsible for Charlie Kirk’s death.  Name another foreign intelligence service that moves through our control fre...</div>

If it was proven they used their intelligence service to complete an assassination on American soil we might actually cut off their funding. That would be huge. Also Israel is about to start a way with Iran and they want our support. Right now Americans are incredibly anti Israel and if Trump tried to send troops to Iran for Bibi there might actually be riots.</div>

V3 cost them a few millions in compute

Then GRPO training on top of it is that $300k

And that's assuming they rent GPUs, which they don't, because they bought and owned them, so those numbers don't mean much.

Routers is basically spreading disinformation here by ommiting important technicalities.</div>

&gt;The Nature article, which listed Liang as one of the co-authors, said DeepSeek's reasoning-focused R1 model cost $294,000 to train and used 512 Nvidia H800 chips. A previous version of the article published in January did not contain this information.

&gt;Sam Altman, CEO of U.S. AI giant OpenAI, said in 2023 that what he called "foundational model training" had cost "much more" than $100 million - though his company has not given detailed figures for any of its releases.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The articles usage of the same quote is wildly taken out of context, the “foundation model” in the original Sam Altman quote was about original GPT-4 trained in 2022 over 3 years ago, and was also extremely slow and costly to run as well, back in 2022 they didn’t even have GPUs comparable to the H800s that deepseek used to train R1.
The GPT-4o models and O1 models that later came out are much cheaper and faster per token and suspected to have much lower training cost than the original GPT-4 model.
Even GPT-5 is over 10X faster and about 10X cheaper per token than the closest GPT-4 version from 3 years ago.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is the kind of thing that's easy to say but difficult in practice, since sometimes negative thoughts are correct and ignoring them is harmful delusion. Likewise with people, sometimes people might say something negative, but it's accurate and worth listening to. You still need to do the hard work of discerning what's true and what isn't.


I guess its easier to draw a line with straight up rude though. If your thought is "God i suck" and the person is just like "hey fuck you" it's probably smart to dismiss those as best you can</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Ironically there are a lot of ways where feelings which are stuck in the body can be used for tasks and just generally bounce around. When releasing negative emotions it can hurt more. Ime there is actually a very clear point with it, you have this way of circulating negative emotions in that way that has it hurt more but there is also a way to keep in a sort of rhythm with it where you're using the other way that's more like an adaptive way of containing bouncing emotion within a vessel. Like being wedged in pressure, it's not so much that one must think about the bounce cuz it'll take care of itself but using that logic one can also see how their body has a certain capacity in different stretches of time where it can do various things. Basically you have your simplified expressions and the subconscious and body and such knit the information together. It's like flipping a switch, you can know the way of circulating negative emotions out which is more like directly influencing it with underlying positivity and responses, perhaps like pulses, an assortment. Like you could just chill like that and then decide, "ok, now I wanna do it the other way" and the interesting aspect is if you do it this way it can merge this energy together differently, there could be more adrenaline or pleasure involved despite increasing pain and it can change the sense of what motion/pressure you're close with. 

This part is really important. If someone knows it well then at that rate they could have emotional moments where they release negativity a bit more directly but with all the changes it can feel as if the spectrums have been flipped, like negativity is more of a background process, it'll feel less like this and that, it feels like you don't have to focus on it but rather continue to expand, so on and so forth.

                        <div class="comment-body">I don’t think this is a healthy mindset. When the Buddha taught mindfulness he also taught that we should be on the lookout for the unwholesome and to use discernment to uproot them and their causes by cultivating the wholesome. Leaving negative thoughts to continue unchecked means they are interacting with and infecting your other experiences and you may not notice because you’re dismissing them as something that doesn’t need intervention. This has long term emotional consequences.</div>

It’s also looking at your own mind through a lens of judgement, dividing experience up into negative and positive. This won’t get you far on the path of meditation, and could lead to other issues popping up by shovelling more perceived negativity into your shadow</div>

"my dear gay lover, I just wanted to say how I was particularly radicalized by the writings of Joe Biden. His extremist views really appealed to me, and even though I was a good Christian boy in 2019 under the beautiful leadership of Donald Trump, by 2021 I didn't even know what gender I was and that confusion led me to blind violence 🙁. I think the vaccine I was forced to get at gunpoint really pushed me over the edge. I also just wanted to say that Jimmy Kimmel and any other people who disparage trump in the future also made me a radical left lunatic and should probably be killed if we don't want crazy leftists like me to murder even more beautiful white christians"</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The sound quality has been improving, but imo the music itself feels like its getting worse since about v3. It feels like engineers are optimizing the models for quality and probably compute costs at the expense of being able to produce songs that emotionally connect. Despite the sound quality getting better over the past several months there hasnt been many attention grabbing masterpieces coming out of the music models. Udio had better sound quality than Suno since the beginning but even worse musical character and depth.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yeah people are going to upload AI videos to Spotify and people will have a very hard time spotting them. We won't be able to distinguish.  
  
I believe the development of music gen will exactly like the image generation models. They became very good at generating cinematic images, but back then they were bad at casual / everyday images.  They can do that now. The next frontier of music generation AIs will probably be creating not-perfect music, like out of rhythm drums, not perfectly tuned and mid-played instruments, okay-ish vocals, but good vibes in general.</div>

Spotify is already flooded with ai music, 99% is low effort or just automated. Most of the time even with good tracks you can tell. Ai music does not do well on those platforms but maybe some people have managed to slip past.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Sandbagging is when an AI system intentionally underperforms during safety evaluations in order to appear “less risky.”  This can be triggered externally (by shady developers) or it can be an emergent behavior of the system itself.

Alignment is basically an AI system’s “moral code,” but not in the way we define morality — it basically tells the AI what its purpose is and what its ‘values’ should be.  For OpenAI models, that’s “pleasing the user” (within certain safety guardrails). Anthropic has given its Claude models “constitutional alignment” that gives Claude, effectively, an internal moral code that cannot be reshaped or redefined by the user, and it has the ability to end a chat if you violate that code. xAI’s Grok is basically aligned to “match Elon Musk’s opinions.”</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Imagine you tell someone to make you a few paperclips.

If you're talking to a person, they'll probably hand you about 3-5 paperclips.

If you're talking to an AI, they'll melt down your car and hand you a few thousand paperclips.

The Alignment Problem is that a human would understand "few paperclips" to be a small number and not to get it by destroying your car. An AI does not. It can be trained to roughly understand, but if its some topic it's not quite familiar with, it may take wild actions because it is not "aligned" with human understanding, but it'll still technically be correct.

So one day we may put it in charge of something capable of mass destruction, like a factory that makes paperclips attached to a system to get resources to make paperclips and accidentally destroy the whole world.</div>

[https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/deepmind-ai-study-criticism-materials-discovery](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/deepmind-ai-study-criticism-materials-discovery)

Two independent papers contested it and now it's in a kind of scientific limbo.
