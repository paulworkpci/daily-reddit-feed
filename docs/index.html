I recently started doing CrossFit and I genuinely love the workouts — the intensity, the progress, the community vibe. But there’s one part I really struggle with: the social side.

I’m quite introverted and slow to warm up to people, and English isn’t my first language. During classes, everyone seems to chat and laugh before or after workouts, while I just stand there awkwardly, not knowing what to say.
It’s not that people are unfriendly — actually, they’re really nice — but I ju...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Just keep going. One of the quickest ways to break the ice with people is just saying “great job” and a fist bump after a workout. Nothing more. Eventually they’ll say you too and you get the break the ice another way, “I like your shoes.” It takes time. I am very introverted and take a long time to warm up to people as well. You don’t have to be a chatty Kathy to make friends. But it does take some time. 

Also worth noting, don’t forget that some of the people in the gym have been training together for months or years. Some of them probably have deep relationships outside the gym. So if they’re talking, joking, and casually carrying on, might just be because they’re actually friends not because they have any issue with you or anyone else. 

If you really wanna make friends, help them put away equipment. Nothing better than turning around after a workout and seeing someone grab a plate or your barbell and put it away. 

Don’t fret the language barrier.</div>

Talk to people when you feel comfortable doing so, and I'd guess the more you go the more other people will start to engage.

a) 95% of chatgpt users are free users and they mainly get access to 5-thinking-mini, which is a smaller model can lack depth in non-stem domains.

b) 5-Thinking (mini too actually) have a very robotic, technical and autistic way of using language. They behave like the perfect machine - very accurate yes, but unpleasant to read and hard to digest.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Because at its core it's a terminal, and every prompt is stand-alone, so after you make a prompt you can still execute terminal commands to change directory or do whatever you want. 

So the whole conversation isn't a separate OS process which can be sandboxed. 

When you call codex, it's sandboxed unless you tell it that it shouldn't be. You call it from the terminal and the UI runs in the terminal, but it's still a separate process. 

If Warp wants to add a sandbox, they have to rethink their whole app or introduce another process per prompt that will then be sandboxed.</div>

And that they over-provisioned everything during the release of codex CLI and they're slowly tuning back the power and turning it into suck. 

It's already about five times more limited than it was when they launched it. 

It's out of control and it's hammering data centers across the world and it's bleeding money. 

You're going to get hooked on a tool that's going to be taken away from you because of the reality of physics and resource allocation. 

And when you want it back it's going to cost $500 a month.

They set the bait now they're getting ready to reel it in.

Eventually the only way anybody is going to have full power codex or equivalent tools is if they're paying $1,000 a month for them. 

It will be priced out of the reach for a lot of people by necessity to keep resources down and manageable and profitable. 

There is no future where you're going to have a cheap and free artificial intelligence system with any kind of power it's going to cost a lot of money. 

And only people that can afford that are going to have it. 

If you're having a good experience with it right now it's because you're a new user and you haven't been throttled yet.

There's going to be a lot of people that come to depend on this and then have it taken away from them and then priced out of their reach. 

This reality is going to come soon.

Not even GPT pro is enough it too is heavily throttled even at $200 a month. 

The only ones that have full  power right now are on Enterprise plans and they're very expensive.</div>

Insane

It hasn't even been a year. I do wonder why that same GPT5-Pro isn't able to do better than o3 preview on ARC-AGI 1 though</div>

The gains these other models have made like GPT-5 Pro despite hugely dropping cost is impressive, shows how far cost per intelligence level has come down. 

Also I’m not sure but o3-preview may have been more finetuned for ARC-AGI which I don’t believe any of GPT-5 is, which again makes its gains on the leaderboard impressive</div>

“You think mold is just a biological nuisance? No! It’s ideological! It’s insidious! Mold creeps and spreads and colonizes, just like Marxist ideology! It doesn’t care about hierarchies, it doesn’t even have two straightforward sexes, it’s an amorphous organism that is the physical manifestation of chaos and disorder! And chaos and disorder is what Marxists worship. Worst of all, when you ignore it, it thrives…. just like the postmodernist nonsense infiltrating our institutions. Clean your room? Of course! But also, dehumidify your basement! Because if you don’t, you’re not just inviting spores, you’re inviting revolution!</div>

If you really think that you're arguing with "luciferian, psychopathic, troll demons" or whatever he called them, just stop talking to them. The guy  is a multi millionaire, he could spend the rest of his life retiring in luxury, spending his remaining years enjoying his life but he'd rather send his health into a death spiral having fights on X.</div>

We’re used to fast progress in LLMs, partially because there is a massive, dense training set. But they still fall down in strange and unexpected ways. Humanoid robotics faces a three fold challenge: small sparse datasets, a uniquely complex environment and actuation system, a requirement of near perfect reliability for safety and extreme compute and power requirements. Even after piggy backing off of advancement in LLMs and computer vision the road ahead is long and unpredictable.


In a couple of years there will be some amazing videos and maybe some new real use cases. But they won’t be ready for broad deployment for many years </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Most special Porsche allocations are sold for ADMs by the dealers anyways. Anyone who pays the ADM can get one, and it's basically the only way to get one as well. Very very few special Porsches (10% imo) go for no ADM, and that too to repeat clients who've spent a few million at the dealer previously.

For reference, Porsche dealers were asking 200-250k ADMs for an ST allocation when they first came out.

Porsche doesn't really do blacklisting. The dealer could be pissed with you for not selling it through them and might not sell you another one. They're not like Ferrari where the HQ controls the allocations. The dealers have most of the say.

Many dealers also play hand-in-hand with the customers to get a special car and flip it immediately to split the profits. Some even order the car themselves and put it up for sale immediately. Happened a lot with the 992.2 GT3s, they were first listed at 400k+.

That said, I think 640k was actually a pretty decent offer and very close to real market value, maybe 10-20k off. All the big dealers buy from BAT, so if there was any margin to be squeezed from that, they would have jumped in. It's got the heritage pack but it's in black which is the least preferred out of the non-pts colors for the S/T. A similar black S/T with similar miles sold for 650k on BaT just over a month ago.

The S/T market has basically settled and will only hold or go down slightly as more S/Ts are released from their 1 year leases (NA only). 650k for a normal car with heritage package and 700-750k for a PTS is where the market's at right now. Dealer's asking prices are obviously higher to account for their margins but they're pretty negotiable. It'll be atleast a few years before the go up substantially.</div>
