Toey would probably be skinny fat with saggy skin without roids instead of the mini ninja turtle he turned into. Edit: you can't exercise as much once you're 50 years old without roids. The body doesn't like it and it will let you know. Toe would have a big a drop off of muscle for sure. Edit: down votes? Look up how most 50 year olds look like. Saggy skin and not much muscle, lol.</div>

Did you start with 5 minutes and then added 5 minutes every day? Or did you immediately start with 20 minutes? Or something else entirely?

Were you consistent about the specific time of the day from the start?

I am also wondering where are you now in your journey.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I started with a hilariously low bar.

Literally two minutes right after my morning coffee, figuring if I couldn't manage 120 seconds of sitting still, I had bigger problems than meditation could fix.

The "secret sauce "wasn't adding time consistently (some days I'd do 5 minutes, others 20, depending on how much my brain was doing its anxious hamster-wheel thing), but making it non-negotiable by tying it to something I already did every single day.

Now I'm about 10 years in, sitting for 15-20 minutes most mornings, and the biggest shift isn't that I'm some zen master. It's that I can actually catch myself spiraling into catastrophic thinking and hit pause before I ruin my whole day over something that hasn't even happened yet.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Here is a short summary of my first 5 years meditating. (Think I’m around 7 years total?)

Time of meditation has never been consistent for me, have a family that makes that hard.  

Started 10 mins a day with headspace.  Took a bit to get consistent and comfortable with it.  Started reading books about meditation and some Buddhism.  Was enjoyable but also incredibly confusing.

Consumed all of headspace, occasionally did longer meditation sessions on a weekend or so for 20-30mins.  Did the Waking Up App, switched to that full time.

1-2 years in… Noticed some strange changes.  Could no longer be tickled unless I wanted to?  Could now feel my awareness at different portions of my body.  Body scanning now made sense.

Could feel my brain and other parts relax in ways I couldn’t before.  Started doing walking meditations with my dog.  Started seeing more common visuals or what they call siddhis while meditating.  Started meditating 20mins a day. Drops in overall anxiety, fear, and anger.

Started to meditate more without my
noise cancelling earbuds.

Year 3? Life stuff happened, motivation to meditate went down and when I tried it was hard.  Very antsy, couldn’t get comfortable, complained about posture etc.  was less consistent even when going down to 10 minutes.

Year 4, more consistent again, more books during off-time.  Back to 20 minutes daily, occasionally long sessions of 1-2 hours(every couple of months.  

Year 5.  Still meditating consistently but now meditate while doing hot yoga as well.  Started meditating with Kasina in addition to normal breath meditation.  Also progress more into insight meditation while breath meditation.  Several changes in what and how I notice the breath.  Glimpses of jhanas 3-4.
More drops in fear, anxiety and anger.

Start looking into meditation retreats.  Lots of different books read, all that make me feel more at ease and more as though I’m on the right path.

Anyways hope this is helpful?</div>

Take a look at the industrial robots installation worldwide, [China installed more industrial robots than the rest of the world combined](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/business/china-factory-robots.html). And it's not slowing down. Pair that with the fact that China is also installing more renewables than the rest of the world combined, and also [more nuclear reactors than the rest of the world combined](https://globalenergymonitor.org/report/china-is-building-half-of-the-worlds-new-nuclear-power-despite-inland-plants-pause/) and you have an unbeatable combination:  massively automated industrial processes and more than enough energy to power that automation.</div>

Unitree are probably my favourite robotics company now after boston dynamics, but they focus on hardware (manufacturing, agility, cost) as they should and they barely focus on AI as they are first and foremost a damn good hardware company.</div>

No shit, people are happy to be given money... 

The real question here is how this impacted the life of other people. Like, what does society gain from giving money to artists specifically?

Also, who is an artist and who isn't? Who decides?</div>

There were ~9000 applicants to the pilot, of which ~8200 were considered eligible. 2000 of these eligible artists were selected via lottery to take part in the pilot. 

The eligibility criteria are pretty broad, and if you were rejected you could appeal. The profession of the "arts" was already defined by the arts act 2003.

The proposed permanent scheme initially is expected to extend the pool by a further 2000.

You have to be active in the arts (although you do not have to produce anything) to receive the ongoing payments. If you find full time employment outside the sector you are not eligible.</div>

In my view, since respect for their original message must precede any innovation, it's understandable that people would be wary of exploiting figures like Martin Luther King Jr. in technical or commercial fields.</div>

I think an intro is more conducive to the current version of video gen AI because it’s inherently a vignette of fairly disconnected short scenes, which AI excels at. If you could get it to match consistency through a whole longer scene, I would be very impressed.</div>

Consistency is the hardest part of this project so far but when the tech gets better so will the quality (hopefully).</div>

LLMs also don‘t work like humans. A human that is very good at math is probably also good at compsc. (Or can at least learn it fast). LLMs need to learn everything or a lot more things all over again</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hello guys,  
  
I just wanted to share my recent experience with integrating a coding agent into my own application.

In the past, I built an app for genealogy because my wife loves researching our ancestors. Her paper version wasn’t very presentable, and I didn’t really like any of the existing tools out there, so I decided to make my own.

Today, I created a simple REST API with an MCP server, which I connected to codex-cli. Then I literally gave it this command:

I have GPT 5 coding for me through a custom MCP server and it's great.

And GPT will help you create the server.</div>

&gt; Here's my take: Every LLM feels dumber over time.
&gt; 
&gt; Providers might quantize models, but I don't think that's what happened.
&gt; 
&gt; It's all honeymoon phase, mind-blowing responses to easy prompts. But push it harder, and the cracks show. Happens every time.

I’m a full-stack developer and I’ve been using Cursor IDE on the Pro plan ($20/month) but I keep hitting the usage limit and even after enabling on demand for extra $40 for two months in a row I still have ~12 days left in the subscription month. This is not sustainable for me.

I’m looking for:

If you use a referral code and subscribe, you get an extra 250 credits one-time that don't expire (unused bonus credits DO roll-over until used).  Here's mine:

https://windsurf.com/refer?referral_code=cjzj3oow3zwiiqcc

I also get an extra 250 credits if you use it, when you subscribe.</div>

If you want to try them, save the code as a html file and run them in your browser.

Models that failed completely included Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, Gemma 3 27B, Aspen, Deepseek 3.2, Zion.  
Qwen3 235 22B and GLM 4.5 Air produced playable versions with a few graphical bugs.

                        <div class="comment-body">Looks like Slate has some competition.

Nobody seems to be talking about this but GM has been making some good moves in the budget car segment recently, even with ICE cars. The new Trax and Envista are great for the price from what I’ve heard. Bonus points for a 6 speed A/T instead of a CVT too.

Not that anyone really cares but they also seem to be upping their game in the upper cost segment, I hear Cadillac is doing some good stuff recently too.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Slate was basically an EV tax credit collection scheme. Unless they can actually sell a truck for lower than $20k at either a small loss or break even, and then reap the high-margin numerous add-ons, they’re fucked.

Edit: if Ford and GM are both saying they will sell you a base trim truck or car EV that doesn’t fucking suck at the same price as Slate before options, why the fuck would you just get the worse car from Slate? Since Slate is explicitly not competing on quality, they need their base truck + enough options for basic functionality (power windows, speakers, etc) to be at a clearly lower price point than the base trim of whatever Ford is making next year, or the new Chevy Bolt. 

Given that the Bolt seems to offer a lot at base, and the Ford truck seems like it will do the same, I find it hard to imagine Slate can actually pull this off without massive cash burn that Bezos will have to cover for years.</div>

But for those looking to get into a budget EV, this should open some doors. The last generation while I had some complaints about the car it was still solid good pic.</div>
