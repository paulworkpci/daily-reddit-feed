**“You are small and insignificant in the universe.”**

It’s wrapped in science-sounding language, whispered through education systems, media, and modern culture:  
“You’re just a speck on a rock, spinning around a star, in a random universe with no meaning.”  
It’s a worldview that strips life of purpose, beauty of depth, and existence of any real connection.

“So then, when you’re in the way of waking up and finding out who you really are, what you do is what the whole universe is doing at the place you call here and now.

You are something the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is something that the whole ocean is doing.

The real you is not a puppet which life pushes around. The real, deep down you is the whole universe.”</div>

"Getting models to reason flexibly across a wide range of tasks may require a more fundamental shift, says the University of Waterloo’s Grossmann. Last November, he coauthored [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02478) with leading AI researchers highlighting the need to imbue models with metacognition, which they describe as “the ability to reflect on and regulate one’s thought process...</div>

                <div class="post-content">It’s like saying, “Don’t look down!” when someone’s walking across a beam – suddenly, all they can think about is looking down. The brain fixates on the action, not the “don’t.” So instead of, “Stop jumping on the couch!” say, “Sit down on the couch.” Rather than, “Get off the road!” (which might make them think, “Cool, I’ll climb that tree!”), say, “Walk on the footpath.” 

Can be applied to all facets of life, including work and personal adult relationships.

If you talk about them like they’re a bad person, why should they bother trying to prove you wrong. They might as well do the bad things you assume of them. Talk highly of them and most of the time they will try to meet that expectation.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I have been thinking so much about this recently. When I was a child and we went to people’s houses my parents always told me not to touch anything, not to run around, not to be loud, etc so I always just sat politely and only spoke when spoken to and never touched anything. I’m an adult and have my own house and I made new friends recently and they came over and walked right in, opened the fridge to put their dessert in and then plopped right down on the couch and really felt comfortable and I honestly just thought “I didn’t know you were allowed to do that”. And I think of all the times that even as an adult I’m in someone’s house and I just hover around until they tell me to sit down or I ask “do you mind if I use your bathroom?” as if they’d rather I walk to the gas station down the street. Like I just literally was never taught what was okay to do at someone’s house but oh boy I sure was taught the many things not to do</div>

After the first time he was now on the radar when code broke before production. He couldn't explain how to fix it because well, he went all vibe coder at work. 

Second time was over the weekend after our weekly code review. The code looked off. it looked like AI wrote it. He was asked to explain the flow and what it does. He couldn't do it so yea....

                        <div class="comment-body">Workplaces which don't use AI for coding are stupid and soon out of date or old school (unless you maybe write rocket controlling critical software). I actually cannot take any software company seriously which will not use it for absolute minimum of 15-20% of new code generated. They just living in the past or have too much compliance or don't know how to utilise in-house AI.

But not being able to understand it or see the errors is of course a big problem. Right now we still need the human to evaluate, judge and bugfix to be glue in all this AI code. But I can imagine in a not so distant future that will become less and less mandatory.

Don't go 100% with zero understanding but definitely use it if allowed.</div>

Idk as time has gone by, I don’t actually think we are really gonna hit real AI with this generation of tech. I feel like this is on the data categorization and synthesis tree not the AI one. I’d bet money that whenever we hit AGI it’ll have nothing to do with what we have now. 

I just don’t think the approach of throwing all of human data into a pretty simple all things considered architecture is the road to true AI. We don’t work that way. No intelligent system we are aware of works that way. They can generalize quickly on tiny amounts of data. Human children can take in a rounding error of that data and learn to speak. It would take a human thousands of years to consume everything these systems require. 

I’ll be pleasantly surprised if I’m wrong though.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Three reforms I'd like to see for class action law suits that don't involve medical claims:

1. Parity in amount: Members of the class have to **receive** at least 50% of the award. Costs to distribute the award don't come out of that 50%.  

2.  Parity in time: The lawyers get paid when the class gets paid. If the lawyers structure a settlement so that the class is paid out gradually over years then the lawyers are paid out gradually over years.

3. Parity in kind. If the class is paid in cash, the lawyers are paid in cash. If the class is paid in coupons, extended warranties, etc., then the lawyers are paid in coupons, extended warranties, etc. If the lawyers would prefer cash, they're free to sell their coupons and warranties on ebay - or negotiate a better settlement.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Notably, Nissan did say it would reimburse any customer who paid for a "qualifying" gearbox repair in the past. If customers had their CVT replaced by Nissan, it would cover the full cost; if they had the work done at an independent shop, they would pay up to $5000 for that work. Importantly, the work had to have happened within the new extended warranty period to qualify for reimbursement.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">But this outcome serves as a template for everyone else.  Now firms have a ton of evidence they can point to for why Nissan was negligent, they just need to prove that their clients were affected in the same way.

This makes it much easier to successfully sue Nissan in the future.  And Nissan is much more likely to settle with these people too.

This is a win for consumers, don't let reddit convince you otherwise.</div>

Because even if we know that the frontier model is safe enough, if someone discovers a technique of the same importance as RLFT, which can turn weak reasoners into strong reasoners, the harmless frontier models of today could turn into dangerous AI tomorrow. We don't want that to happen in an uncontrolled fashion.</div>

Some people tried to say it was just an echo or some reverberation from the bullets but it sounded like different rhythms from different guns. 

Like two different drummers playing two different songs in different time signatures.</div>

Interesting to click around the data there. 

Also Windows 95 has a storage limit of 32GB. Just one hundred of Terabytes is 100,000 GB. The laptop thing is a weird lie that keeps getting repeated.</div>

It doesn't really give any indication or insight into how much of the content of the post is genuinely human-written vs completely AI generated from a basic prompt. I could put this comment through and ask them to just spellcheck it and nothing else and I'm sure ChatGPT would replace the two dashes in here with emdashes. Even if every single word was written by me and they just fixed 2 typoes.</div>

Small percentage of users use em-dash by themselves. On the other hand there is a large portion of AI content that did not use em-dash or it was fixed by a human to remove AI-like terms and dashes.

  
Nonetheless the trend is here.</div>

I used a great deal of server time with o1 and 4o to edit, re-edit, and re-re-re-re-edit my essays. I used it to spitball interview practice as well as a sort of rubber ducky to nail down my 'story.' I wouldn't have realized how valuable some of my experiences were without it, and one in particular was explicitly mentioned to me from my interviewer as the reason I got in/they loved me as an applicant.

So you could say I'm making negative money with AI, having just signed the loan paperwork a few days ago...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This sounds cool. I have a few questions if you don't mind.

1. Are you making AI models that do things on your onlyfans? Or it just pics? 

2. Do the "fans" think these girls are real? Or do they know they are AI? 

3. What tools are you using?

4. How much are you making a month with a page?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes, of course, for a long time. In terms of automating processes we were able to gain about 18-20% of income (team of 15 people, €6.5-7m yearly income), staying with the same size of the team. That's mostly because our operations team (9 people) saves about 190-200hrs monthly thanks to some LLM workflows we introduced.

So it's more like one of users said - it's more about saving time and thus money rather than making money from the scratch. At the moment you still need a working business idea to utilize it. It's tough to built something from the scratch on AI, except trainings, consulting and stuff like that.</div>

How many criminals will go free claiming that blurry video, which was until now irrefutable evidence, is AI and that's not them stabbing a passer by fourty three times?

How many fake kidnappings?

Between now and whenever new identity verification methods are invented, how many people's lives will be ruined by identity theft?
