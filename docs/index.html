Driving becomes really enjoyable when every red light, slow driver in front, or diversion doesn't matter because you're ahead of time.

And if you get there without any delays, the extra 15 minutes will fly by, and you're not stressing about being late</div>

"The most important and most impactful thing for driving safety happens before you even step into your car. It's making sure you leave early." It reduces stress, keeps you from speeding, makes you less prone to agitation due to "slow" or "bad" drivers, makes you less distractable. Imagine if we could reduce these causes for accidents.

BTW I'm not saying it's easy to be punctual. It's easier for some people than others.</div>

If we have to be somewhere at 10 and it takes 15 minutes to get there, they START getting ready to go at 9:45 if I don't do anything. I now make it a point to tell everyone to start getting ready, at least 10 minutes before we need to leave, and even then they sometimes are very begrudging about acting when I tell them to saying I'm being too anxious. Then lo and behold, we actually arrive on time. They've gotten better, but it still sucks being late when I was ready to go well before they even started.</div>

I have a few people in my family that have some version of this or time blindness or whatever. Letting people like this know about the getting ready time almost always meets resistance. They just ignore it and fall into old patterns. 

When I am part of the plans for meet ups, I just fudge the arrival time by like 20 minutes. I often say stuff like “traffic is bad that time of day so it’ll add to the time it takes to get there” or some other justification. 

The end result is they show up actually on time pretty much every time.</div>

-An avid supporter of Kirkpatrick

-Did not see a conflict of interest with Kirkpatrick’s professional background

-Did not see a conflict of interest with AARO sitting in the DOD

-Did not attend Grusch’s classified testimony to the SSCI

-Did not attend Grusch’s public testimony on Jul 26th ‘23

-Continued to say Kirkpatrick was incredibly capable following LinkedIn outburst

-Pushed for Grusch to meet with Kirkpatrick

-Lamented Kirkpatrick stepping down

-Is more focused on shooting down UAP than following a trail of breadcrumbs to craft in contractor hangars and unravelling the biggest conspiracy in human history

Matt next time you speak to Gillibrand can you ask her why she does not see a conflict of interest with AARO sitting inside a federal dept implicated in covering up legacy crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs?</div>

That's a completely logical starting point, though. AI, at least in its current form, isn't actually intelligence, its a really advanced pattern recognition tool. It doesn't actually understand the information its relaying, which is why you can easily convince it of things like "1+1 = 3", and it will believe you, and from that point on, operate under the assumption that information is true until its memory forgets you said that. And it reverts back to the pattern it recognizes most elsewhere, which is 1+1=2. Not because the AI knows that's the correct answer, but because its the answer that it sees the most when asked what 1+1 is, and now its free of the bias you gave it when you said 1+1+3

With creative ventures like art and writing, there isn't an objective correct way to do it. An AI image generator can pump out anime girls, and so what if it sometimes messes up the hands? Real artists do too half the time.  It doesn't completely destroy the image. Chalk it up to artistic intent. Same with writing stories, as a writer myself, when an AI generates a story that has a plot hole, a poor introduction, a grammar error, or some other inconsistency, that's just something that happens. Oh well.

But if you take AI, and put it to work with say, business. Suddenly AI mistakes become more objective when the AI starts spending money your business doesn't actually have, but the AI thinks you do. Or convinces itself that your in a contract with someone you aren't, or is gaslit by a thief into believing your company owes them money.

Or for a real life example, the AI UnitedHealthcare uses to process claims, which is extremely error prone. Or the AI Summaries every website seems keen to offer now, which often make things up through a lack of understanding of what they're looking at, as well as confirmation bias towards whatever it is you're searching.

For the essence of what I'm trying to say, AI algorithms TECHNICALLY, are more knowledgeable than any human on the planet can ever hope to be. But in practice, since they don't actually understand what they're processing, and instead are only searching for patterns they've been trained to detect. At times, they can be worst than the most stubborn, stupid person you've ever met. When that happens while generating an image or paper. You get worse quality, or factual inaccuracies. If that happens in a work environment, the consequences are just a *bit* more severe. So it makes sense that this technology is first being tested with these creative endeavors. And why companies are so shameless in Datascraping their users for their AI's despite fierce push back from said users. They want these AI's to be good enough for general use. And they most certainly don't want them to improve for the benefit of people like us.</div>

Times were hard in feudalism.  It didn't create strong people that lifted the world up.  It created centuries of feudal slaves.

Prosperity occurs when the middle class is strong in political power and wealth.  As well the gap between the richest and the poorest is relatively small.  That's it.  That's the secret.</div>

A year ago? I was falling asleep at 3am after hours of gaming, skipping meals, ghosting plans, and telling myself I’d “do better tomorrow.” I wasn’t addicted because I loved gaming -- I was addicted because I didn’t know how to face my life without it.

So I quit.

He wakes up early,,somehow has time for the gym at 7 am, and gets "focused work " done by noon. Whatever the hell that is.

Look i know I'm a hypocrite because I made an epic post years ago and never followed through with it but here's the thing, at work I have lots of downtime, which leads to lots of random scrolling. To.be honest i have no idea how to get around this downtime doomscrolling. Like many people I can't just wake up 7 am and go to the gym and then do "focus work" until noon. That's not practical advice.</div>

There's plenty of things Joe Rogan has said and done in the last 5 years or so that has made an old fan like myself completely lose faith but the ukraine topic takes the genocidal cake.

In fact, they will absolutely spin this as something like, _"these kids would still be alive if zelensky had stopped this war years ago."_ if not just stooping to, _"why would Russia bomb kids? Ukraine is losing so likely killed these kids themselves as a false flag to try to make Russia look evil."_ etc.

So why have 2 years of war with them and refuse peace deals?

Tell me what your solution to the end of the war is. I'm all ears. The average age of the Ukrainian military is now over 50 years old btw now. 

Go for it.

You seem to care more about being against Russia than the thousands of innocents Zelensky pushed into the meat grinder, knowing they couldn't possibly win.

You don't actually care about Ukrainian lives.</div>

I feel like I have an actual neurological dependence on my phone I can feel it lingering even when i'm not using it and it's scary. I don't feel like an actual human anymore. I'm trying not to use it for the rest of the day because i'm trying to lower my screen time substantially and just wanted to brain dump these thoughts in case anyone can relate .</div>

But life can get better \*on average\* if you put the screen down and make changes to your environment. internet causes depression -&gt; use internet more to cope with depression -&gt; stagnation

I try to think of it this way. Quitting the internet won't change your life but quitting (or cutting back) will give you a lot of your time and power back to change it yourself.</div>

Their market cap was crazy disproportionate to their actual market share. And that was entirely due to the reputation Elon brought to the table. He told everyone he was a genius, the investors believed him.

                                <div class="reply-body">Theres already a difference between millennials and gen z. 

Millennials know how to operate a computer the best (on average) because we grew up when it was harder.

Does it matter, not really. Gen z didn’t learn a lot of the nitty gritty because they didn’t need to. Young kids today won’t need to know nearly as much as gen z do either.

                                <div class="reply-body">I see the steps in the evolution. First, doctors will use AI to either confirm their diagnosis and avoid misdiagnosis, with or without patient awareness of this use. We might even get doctors advertising this use once acceptance rates are high enough.

Eventually, once people feel more comfortable, they will have a choice of paying for the human doctor diagnosis or paying much less for a pure AI diagnosis. A lot of people won't have this choice: they can't afford the doctor.

At this point the whole system has crumbled further than it already has, currently.

That could happen even before it becomes either pjblicly accepted that AI does a better job, or regulated that AI **must** be used in the diagnosis.

Any government providing healthcare will *choose* to go the cheaper route (tax payer money and all that) and at some point that will be the AI model, either just for being cheaper, or for lowering healthcare costs due to effectiveness.

All of this doesn't even touch the point of ethics: at some point, leaving people without access to therapy, education, healthcare and basic services, purely because you can't afford human service even when AI - perhaps even not as effective as humans - is available for much cheaper and it becomes an ethical issue: is it better to provide an AI tutor for children in an area where paying for teachers is not a possibility or should they be left without an education?</div>

You're close but the therapeutic effect is real.

It turns out people do poorly when they feel that someone isn't taking care of them. The reverse is also true.

It might be that nurses/doctors convert more to someone that interacts between the AI and explain things to you in a way that helps with the therapeutic effect.

That is until robots can jump past the uncanny valley and are MORE compassionate than humans.

Which should take 3-4 more months.</div>

It is so amazing because you can ask EXACTLY what you want, and it will give it. When I have to ask google that, it takes me long time to find what I am looking for.

For those that think “You should know those things if you’re a doctor!”, yes I agree with you. But we forgot things as humans. Tragically we are quite good at recognizing things we have learned before, but terrible at recall. AI can fill in the gaps till you get to years of experience.

EDIT: Felt I needed to add a disclaimer! The questions I use it for help are all medical standardized questions, where the correct answer would be apparent as the answer would always only have one that can be correct. The bloods, labs, etc. are all given as needed to get the right answer, and NEVER to trick you. Hence, it is good cause in a sense it is “obvious” what the correct one is if you know enough. Unfortunately real life is nothing like that, and never that clear, so DO NOT TRUST IT FOR REAL WORLD DIAGNOSIS.  If you have a problem, SEE A DOCTOR!</div>

I'm a regular person who got correctly diagnosed by GPT one month before my doc appointment. Yesterday the doctor confirmed exactly what gpt told me a few weeks ago was wrong with my eyes. I was looking at the various supplements and medicines (eye drops, etc) used in studies on pubmed related to my issues and was asking gpt to help me understand some of the details, I, as a layman, didn't fully get. It also found some obscure connections that I the searched for on pubmed and they were there. 

After my doc's appointment, where he said exactly what I expected him to say, he prescribed me medicine which I knew he would because gpt already told me in advance. But the doc didn't go into details about how or what to combine with or stay away from, and while the pharmacist told me some of it, gpt filled in the rest of the details. Of course, I checked all the extra info that gpt gave me online, and all was correct. It was so correct, it was uncanny, I have to admit.</div>

Are you getting proper nutrition and water intake daily? 

Excercising regularly? 

Start with those things at the minimal and see if the brain fog clears up. 

For not having friends - try volunteering for something for a few hours on the weekends. It’ll get you introduced to new people as it’s important to exercise that social muscle too. 

The exercise and volunteering will boost your self confidence and allow you to accept yourself as you are instead of question why you’re the way you are, which is very important to move forward from here.

Also would suggest to take an MBTI personality test to understand yourself and your brain better.</div>

I function best when I'm acoustically monomaniacally focusing on something. However, I also generally turn into a crazy person when I don't talk with my friends for a bit.

Idk, any of you had similar experiences?</div>

You're increasing your dopamine when having fun with them. If you have a LOT of fun, your dopamine spike will be great.

But all spikes in dopamine necessitate a drop below baseline. Dropping below baseline feels awful, and can lead to anger and depression.

This happened to me recently after play REPO with my friends on discord for 6 hours. It was incredibly fun. Next day I felt terrible though.

Doesn't matter if the dopamine hit is from Adderall or friends and fun events, dopamine spikes necessitate a drop below baseline.

You can look up "Andrew huberman dopamine mindset and drive" to learn more about it. 

Although, my drop below baseline only lasted a day. It is a bit odd to me to hear it lasting for multiple days</div>
