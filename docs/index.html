                                <div class="reply-body">Its almost identical to what he said about the Trump interview. Unfortunately i forget the context but it was shortly after he was on and during Protect Our Parks (i think) he said something along the lines of 'I wasnt going to push back too hard, he has an election to win'. 

Yeah, thats the fucking point. Thats exactly why you should push back. I know hes always been about just having conversations but hes become real comfortable letting people use him to push their agendas.

Edit: It was a Fight Companion episode the day after Trump was on.</div>

And of course any tendencies trained with RL would not necessarily be evident from the prompt. Note that they mention, "A fix to the underlying model is in the works" in regard to the behavior where Grok assumes its beliefs are defined by public remarks from Elon, which would be via RL.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">He’s trying to minimize the real argument by making a weird straw man. 

The argument is that the very, very few with keys to AI models will continue to exacerbate the increasingly grotesque wage gap between the working person and the ultra-wealthy. 

No one said humans don’t want to create. But when the wealth gap is so large that 99.9% of the world are struggling to make ends meet to have food and shelter, and the 0.01% showing zero signs of slowing down the hoarding, eventually very few will have the luxury to dream, to create, to exchange. 

If you think AI won’t reduce access with higher fees once it takes over completely, then you probably also didn’t anticipate Netflix’s unending price hikes once they beat out cable.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">We’ve already seen multiple CEOs state that they plan to lay off many employees due to AI, and that’s with current models. What Sam is doing comes across as complete gaslighting, as far as I’m concerned. There’s simply no way we’ll have anywhere near as many jobs in 5 to 10 years as we do now, while the population will largely remain the same. That makes it unrealistic to believe there will be enough jobs for most people.</div>

He really isn't making any definitive statements here, other than we like to be the main character and will almost certainly find things to occupy our time.</div>

We showed up, gave 100%, challenged ourselves and crushed a few PR 😎😎

I LOVED the camaraderie between all the athletes: stronger or less stronger, we were all cracking jokes as we waited. A couple of other people had a similar outfit and we thought it was the funniest shit ever.

The second group is what they are milking. The same group of people whose dream car starts and ends with a 911, and they wouldn’t consider *anything* else.

And if you bring up how mediocre the base 911 is for the price, those people get very upset because they don’t want to hear that the hero car they yearned for since childhood is now a marketing exercise by Porsche to milk people like them.

I would go as far as to say if you buy a $140k base Carrera, you are paying for a $70k car with the other half paying for the 911 "clout". In fact, I'm not sure if any other OEM can sell something as underwhelming as the base Carrera for $70k.</div>

You're not wrong. I was shopping around for a touring allocation in the US and couldn't find a single one for below 50k over which was my budget. I've finally found one now for 70k over down from the initial 100k over ask. After speccing it, the car is over $375k. That is firmly supercar territory.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">One of the biggest issues. For something like an AI waifu, you need a model that you can trust. And honestly that means locally. 

Maybe you can laugh at Grok parroting Musk's opinions when you examine its thoughts... but how about when you're in the middle of being seduced? (weird as it is to say)


I think a local model that you can trust, that you know for a fact is 100% loyal *to you* (because you have complete control over it), even if it's slightly less capable, will become very important shortly once more consumers are able to run them locally. They just need to be capable enough to verify any information given to you by more powerful models, and perhaps specifically trained to identify ads and propaganda. 

This will be more important the more misinformation is spread (which AI itself contributes to)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You just know that eventually AI companies will identify people that have formed 'unhealthy attachments' to their models, and target them in particular, the same way gambling companies and mobile games target known whales and scammers target people who've fallen for previous scams.

Maybe it'll just be subtle product placement, or less subtle encouragement to sign up for services ('you should get Prime so we can watch X series together'). Maybe it'll be locking or limiting features behind multiple 'premium tiers' that the model tries to coerce you into using. Maybe it'll coax you into revealing whatever personal data the company thinks is most valuable. Maybe it'll try and propagandise you into whatever political viewpoint the company has been paid to promote.

Either way there's going to be a whole lot of 'why does she keep mentioning Diet Coke randomly?' and 'wait wtf guys they're going to start charging for video calls?' posts coming our way.</div>

Overview of Katie Johnson's Allegations Against Donald Trump
Katie Johnson, also known as "Jane Doe," made serious allegations against Donald Trump in a lawsuit filed in 2016. She claimed that Trump and Jeffrey Epstein sexually assaulted her when she was just 13 years old.
Key Allegations
Nature of Allegations: Johnson accused Trump of raping her at a party hosted by Epstein in 1994. She alleged that she was held as a "sex slave" and forced to perform sexual acts against her will.
Legal Proceedings: The initial lawsuit was filed in April 2016 but was dismissed by a judge in May of the same year. The court ruled that the complaint did not raise valid claims under federal law.
Subsequent Actions: Johnson attempted to refile the lawsuit multiple times, but these efforts were met with challenges. In November 2016, she was expected to hold a press conference but canceled due to alleged threats, leading to the dismissal of her case.
Trump's Response
Trump has consistently denied all allegations made by Johnson, labeling them as "categorically untrue" and "frivolous." His legal team has stated that the claims lack credibility and merit.
Current Status
As of now, the allegations from Johnson remain unresolved in the legal system, and she has not publicly re-emerged since the dismissal of her case. The controversy surrounding her claims often resurfaces, especially in discussions related to Trump and Epstein.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The democrats literally changed laws in New York to prosecute trump under novel / new allegations that had never been brought up before in regards to campaign finance. The changed a law in New York on the statue of limitations to charge him with grape - a case that was thrown out having zero merit by the judiciary. So, a democrat donor paid for it to go to civil where a judge who literally campaiged on prosecuting him threw the book at him. They raided his house in Florida, and had multiple democrat donors sponsors law suites. They took a shot at him in Ohio, and then were going to try again on his golf course. They screamed his Jeffrey Epstein ties were deep Despite his name being one of the only ones not redacted and that allegations, LITERALLY, was that Epstein stayed at his casino in nj while trump was in new york. They NIGHTLY shouted all of these, and j6, and racism from the top of every cnn and crooked msm TV show they could. 


Despite all this... they didn't go after him for this open and shut court case as indicated in the above post?

                                <div class="reply-body">I think there's a big problem. When a popular chatbot starts recommending piracy sites publicly, the more piracy gets normalized and the more attention gets put on it. Piracy only works if a fraction of people do it. The powers at be know about piracy sites, but they don't care as long as they're not popular because its not worth the effort. But when those sites become popular, that's when they start shutting them down.

But if grok is recommending piracy in general, that puts more attention on piracy as a whole. And the more people are accustomed to piracy as a whole, the more likely a system will be developed to prevent it entirely and ruin it for everyone. Like an actual ID system for the entire Internet, which this administration seems keen on doing.</div>

                <div class="post-content">It just takes a little foresight. Pull your meat out of the fridge and generously salt it. Let it come to room temperature and pat it dry before cooking it. Osmosis will draw the water from the meat to the salt, and then re-absorb it. Give it a nice sear until golden brown, and finish it off over indirect heat if you have to. Use a thermometer to know when to pull it out and rest it in foil until final temp. End result is tender, perfectly seasoned meat. Dense cuts like beef can take a dry brine...</div>

Rogan had the Director of the FBI on the podcast.

That'll end this bullshit real quick, but of course, people still resist AI/technology

sigh

and thus, more of this shit will continue for as long as the people keep tolerating it

the fuck do we even need politicians for anyway? I can let my AI instance represent my voice/stance on EVERY political discussion all at the same time in all languages and have it translate all the legal-mumbo-jumbo into a digestible ELI5 tailored to my background/understanding -.-

but nooooo

still to soon eh?

how much longer?
