He's a chronic liar, which should set off red flags, but it seems like a lot of people these days dont mind lying if it aligns with their political views. This administration is a complete dumpster fire. People are holding positions that they are not remotely qualified for. Their only qualifications are loyalty to the king. As a history nerd, this should be scaring people, but I guess they dont understand the consequences of their ignorance and buffoonery.</div>

Humans are a communal and social species; all this shit of social individualism is a scam to make us work harder as part of the machine so we can “be good people” in the eyes of our society that is largely curated by capitalists. It’s been driven into us that if we can’t support ourselves, we are failures, and that idea is fucking deadly to our species. Just because you can work yourself into to an early grave doesn’t mean everyone else is actually happy to do so.</div>

• (s) = short-term / shipping soon – things already in progress or launching soon

• (m) = medium-term – projects still in development, coming in the next few quarters

• (r) = research / longer-term – still experimental or needing breakthroughs before release

So it’s not model names or anything like that—just a way to flag how close each initiative is to becoming real.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Got downvoted in the o3-pro release thread for calling people stupid for drawing conclusions about agentic planing/multiturn abilities of a model from AIME or other single-turn benchmarks. 

I'll say it again: You guys are fucking stupid.

Our internal benchmarks roughly match OP's result. The jump from o3-pro to latest gemini 2.5 is like from gemini 2.5 to o1. It's quite big actually. (Also it takes like 10-15 times as much money and time). Should be also pretty obvious the second you are using the model that it is quite on another level seeing it takes more time to answer then deepresearch for certain tasks.

You'll see when Aider updates.


**BUT** if you could force Gemini to also run 10 times longer, Gemini probably would be even better. But you currently can't, and I still don’t get why there’s no model yet where you can just define the amount of resources you want it to consume. Or let a specialized model A analyze the problem and figure out the ideal resource budget so model B gets exactly the compute it needs to solve it optimally. You know, like when you read a test and think, “oh shit, I have to think now. giga brain activate!”</div>

For o3-pro it seems very obvious that the longer allocated thinking time is what's allowing it to crush previous models, so I wonder how well Gemini 2.5 Deep Think would score.</div>

In general i don't believe anyone anymore who claims that they have never thought an AI video was real.

No one is any less intelligent for being "fooled" by AI video. 

I think for a lot of "maybe not super bright people" it's an ego thing. "I'm so smart and machines are so dumb, a machine could never fool me. Ha zoom in on that finger and see!"

I'm sure I have seen some first specifically convincing clip at least a year ago that I didn't question if it was real or not. 

And then I was surprised to realize it was AI. Kind of wild how many times I have experienced that already. But mostly with more mundane shorter clips.</div>

Some of y’all wanted me to put on a belt in my last post so I did. 260kg/573lbs in my Brooklyn Lifting Co belt.

I am very apprehensive how well a fully agentic method such as Claude code would work in game dev, I fully expect that if I got it and left it going as many do, I would end up with he most horrific mess. sonnet 4 struggles even with small systems with very detailed prompts for me. depends what system though.

I am currently on Cursor and I am happy with it as a tool to boost my productivity with the afore mentioned smaller heavily guided tasks. though I do not like VS Code at all. have not checked jetbrains rider in a while, but if/when that catches up in it's LLM options, I will probably make the switch. 

I currently find Gemini 2.5 pro the best on coding in Unity, it seems a bit more up to date on it's netcode, I found that sonnet was writing code that had errors it was not aware of, and used depreciated stuff a lot. other than that sonnet seemed pretty good too though (I will note that sonnet 4 seems way better getting it to code something from its chat, rather than through cursor though)</div>

Then he asked if we were close to the ocean. No, we were 10 miles inland... "I just follow my map" he said.

While 20 years ago cab drivers had every street memorized, now Uber drivers don't even bother because Google Maps is an ASI-level navigator! It can find the fastest route from anywhere to anywhere.

We invent a thing to do a task, we master the thing, and then we invent a new thing to do the *old thing* for us so we can do something cooler. We went from assembly code to high-level languages. We went from raw server code to frameworks. This is just us upgrading from the tricorder to the ship's main computer. You're not getting replaced by the computer; you're getting promoted to the captain's chair to tell the computer what to do.</div>

In software engineering, one could argue that the upper limit of what can be built is nearly infinite. Every new challenge or integration opens the door to countless new possibilities—meaning there's room for an endless number of “captains” leading their own efforts. But what about fields like law or medicine? These professions operate within more finite boundaries. There are only so many types of legal disputes or diagnosable conditions.

Industries with a finite scope of problems are especially susceptible to disruption. As automation advances, these domains will become increasingly commoditized—solving once-complex problems quickly, cheaply, and repeatedly.

Ironically, it’s the industries with infinite creative potential—like engineering—that will produce the tools and systems that make these “finite captain” professions obsolete.</div>

If the ai is better at every task then humans, there’s no new higher level thing we can focus on, we are completely redundant. 

Until now we have always automated a limited part of our tasks or surpassed human intelligence in a narrow field, so we could create new jobs in other fields. 

When we have agi there are no other fields.</div>

If Waymo is significantly safer than human drivers (which it appears to be), then eventually the conversation will switch from "do we care about people losing jobs" to "do we care about people losing lives". The people who lose their lives every year to careless drivers will come into sharp focus once people start to get over the initial shock of change. We've come to accept a certain amount of road deaths every year as we assume that there isn't a better alternative. Once there is a better alternative - i.e. one that can see farther, doesn't get distracted, doesn't drink or take drugs, how long before we stop settling for human inadequacies.

The same will be true of the medical field - is AI more competent? Well, then, nothing else matters as much as that, so AI will eventually dominate.

Too many conversations about jobs talk about "AI can't do my job as well as I can" or "there's no reason for the industry to change". Yeah really? Well, what if it actually does the job *better* than you. 

e.g. Clearly not every human lawyer is equally competent, so surely there are plenty of incompetent bad ones. Is it conceivable that AI can be as good or better than the worlds best lawyer? If it can beat the world's best Go Player, then why the hell not? Do lawyers really think their field is more difficult than Go? And if AI can beat the world's best lawyer, then why the hell wouldn't you use the AI?

Just imagine you're going to get a medical diagnosis AI- DOC  has been around for 5 years and has been established as being more accurate than human docs in that time. Forgetting about the fact that it's probably cheaper. Who are you going to use?

Replace doctor with Lawyer, Engineer, Architect, Taxi driver. 

All careers with high stakes. And therefore I think careers where competency matters more than anything else. These are the ones where ultimately AI has to dominate.

I think it's jobs which are less crucial - the Arts, service industry etc.. where people will be happy to be supporting other humans, they won't care as much about results</div>

                <div class="post-content">Once you begin to truly observe human behavior without reacting, you’ll notice a quiet truth—most people are not speaking to you, but from within themselves. Their anger, judgments, even their praise, often reflect their own fears, wounds, and conditioning. The moment this becomes clear, something within you relaxes. You no longer carry every word on your shoulders. You stop taking things so personally—not out of coldness, but from a deep understanding that everyone is simply revealing where the...</div>

It gets really weird especially from the lens of mirror self image where you start noticing it in yourself when you interact with others as well. I try my best to treat everyone with a general respect, I feel like I'm a lot less agitated most days but there are still days where my patience runs thin and I notice myself being short with people. I know I'm at least far less reactive than I used to be. I work in sales so in general I take most things people say with a grain of salt, but sometimes it's hard to switch off that default customer service/sales act with people and act through my true self, even though that act is just being generally respectful, kind and humble which ideally is what we should strive for, no?</div>

The smartest thing you can do? Act like it’s a job. Show up. Even if the lecture seems boring or you are running on 3 hours of sleep. Half of success in your first year is just being there. Once you start skipping just one class, it spirals fast. You don’t need to be perfect, just consistent. Trust me, future you will thank you.

                                <div class="reply-body">That’s genuinely correct. I’ve known plenty of idiots who only made it through school because they “tried hard” and the professors didn’t want to fail them. I’ve also known plenty of idiots who absolutely shouldn’t keep their jobs but their bosses don’t want to fire them, and the clients like them even though they’re incompetent. I have a coworker currently (I’m in construction management) and the dude is an absolute idiot, no idea what he’s doing. However he’s always on time, and the clients love him so a lot of missed deadlines get overlooked. If you show up, and people like you, then you’ll be fine. You may not be in the top, but you’ll get by.</div>

You have to earn your license and your conduct with its use proves that you are reasonable to the have the privilege to drive.

Repeatedly endangering the lives of other citizens with reckless driving, excessive speeding, or driving under the influence is entirely fair cause to revoke one's privileges to drive on public roads. 

If they want to retain such privilege, they may elect to have this speed limiter installed. Similar to how one may have a breathalyzer installed on their vehicle after repeated DUI-related offenses.</div>

Can we agree he is very smart ? Yea but do we know enough math and the math that other very smart people do to judge them against one another ? No, not op atleast</div>
