I know the world is a mess, but it doesn't do anyone any good to constantly scroll through severely negative topics.

And no one is *fighting the power* by re-tweeting posts and making angry Tiktoks. </div>

meanwhile you went outside  
read something real

they’re mad at the mirror you held up by just… living different

It's all distorted through a fucking lens and it's all rife with distorted propaganda, nothing you see online is real, not even people's faces with all those freaking filters, not even the lives that they portay, nothing, and soon with AI it will be even less


OP,  your friends are deeply brainwashed.


 Reality is what happens when you shut down the noise of your phone. All that you see in here, nothing is real.


It's a total reality distortion.</div>

Trump doesn't care. The man is tanking the economy, threatening to invade and conquer allied nations, rounding people up in the streets. He serves his donors, and the Israel lobby is a powerful one. If people start genuinely being more antisemitic, and his donors feel personally threatened, or his Jewish grandchildren, you think he won't start killing people?</div>

As a general rule, one side in these culture wars doesn't get a choice about their engagement with it. If you're the "undesirable" side of the debate, you have skin in the game whether you like it or not, whatever your degree of political awareness. It's politically immobilising for that reason.</div>

However, your message is particularly for the right side since they are the ones who seem to actively support the powers that be and carry out their dirty work of actually attempting to genocide certain sectors of society. The far right will always be a tool of the wealthy and of the state which is owned by the wealthy, always have been. 

I would love for them to see how they’re being manipulated, but until then the far left will have to continue helping as a defense for society’s most vulnerable. 

And yes, those factions are perfectly capable of defending themselves, they are just outnumbered.</div>

they’re crutches, not discipline

that said, here’s what’s actually worked for ppl who are **serious** about breaking the scroll:

**what** ***kinda*** **works:**

* **Freedom** – full device lockdown across apps/sites, schedules well
* **StayFocusd** – brutal on Chrome, can nuke entire sites for the day after you hit limits
* **Cold Turkey** – desktop-level lockdown, no mercy
* **Forest** – more mental trick than blocker, but gamifies staying off
* **old phone + no SIM** – physical downgrade &gt; software discipline

**what works** ***best*****? behavior rewiring:**

* delete all social media on weekdays
* physically put phone in a locked box or leave it in car during work
* set ONE purpose per unlock (text X, check weather, done)
* grayscale your screen—makes it all feel lifeless
* track screen time daily, journal shame in 1 sentence

**if i could design the perfect app?**

* every unlock = random 3-sec recording of *you* saying “put it down”
* no snooze. no override. just your own voice calling you out
* any app you open makes you do 10 pushups first

but real talk—**no app fixes what boredom, loneliness, and dopamine loops create**  
you gotta swap the habit with *something that actually excites you offline*

or you’ll just find new ways to scroll</div>

I use **Ahero App**: blocks apps by default on iphone, and you a set a daily unlock limit. You can lock the settings. I wish they added an limit on how # of unlocks. Syncs to desktop and I can block sites/apps when working. 

I pair that with the default apple screen time time limits and a **physical lock box** sometimes. Has been working for me.</div>

&gt;We are at a place where we want to displace the process of art making from our lives?

The absolute contrary; we are at a place where we can remove some of the barriers to creating art. instead of the limitation being hours spent with a pencil and expensive training, it's now imagination, vision, and message. someone lacking those 3 will still produce uninteresting art, but someone with all 3 can produce good art without artificial barriers. the biggest barrier is gate-keepers like yourself who want to invalidate their work without evaluating it, simply judging it by the tool use to create it.</div>

It's not one shittin on the other, it's the idiotic vocal 5% in each group who do a pissing contest. Most people just use AI for fun, making their lives easier and work related stuff.

&gt;training from the works of those actual artists lol

How do humans learn to make arts.... They go to (expensive) schools and get shown art and get educated how to create said art. Then after some learning time, the use everything they got trained on to use and create art.

Do you see a connection?

&gt;thoughts and skills that go into the making of the product right

The thoughts are still from humans. The human conceptualizes the image, comes up with a prompt and trys again till it is right. Understanding how to communicate with AI to get the wanted result is also a skill. Not as hard to learn as photorealistic drawing, but harder than drawing abstract art.


PS: You know, you could say the same about mowing the lawn with a sickle, which required skill. The movement, the sharpening, the energy, the time....

Nobody forces you to use a lawnmower, be done in 30 minutes. You can still laugh at the unkilled people useing one, while you stand on your freshly sickled hill after a whole day of work. You do you and the rest of the world will move on.</div>

There’s no way to quantify that in the human brain for everyone to get their fair share but I hope in the future there should be a way to do this. If there’s a hit AI song that uses 1% of Aerosmith, 20% AC/DC, 50% RHCP, and 29% Guns &amp; Roses. Then all of those bands deserve writing credit. I don’t think services like Suno giving a fuck about that as of now but hopefully there’s an agreeable path forward.</div>

Metallic Sphere Spotted in the Jungles of Colombia

Location: Colombia  
Time: 13:30

I am not the OP, This video was found on your favourite Chinese Social Media app.

This object seems to be an E.T./Alien Drone of some sort and has been spotted around the world including being filmed by the US military in Iraq.

This is also the same object in this Why Files Documentary: The Betz Sphere: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhBVWX0IkIk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhBVWX0IkIk)

Couple problems with it:
Disjointed editing. There’s a bunch of cuts between clips instead of one long continuous shot. 

The filming doesn’t continue until the object leaves the area.</div>

I don't know what they're using here or how far they're zoomed in at points, but when I'm recording things in the sky at 25x or greater zoom, it can be hard for me to swing my mount smoothly and keep the shot perfectly aligned. Every tiny adjustment dramatically changes the view when I'm that zoomed in.
 
Even worse if the person keeps looking at the object rather than watching the camera to ensure it's on point.

Yep, something that's used often the user is likely quite peculiar about it. Even if you buy them an exact same one, they may already have plans for a different color, style, etc.</div>

If the item in mind is custom made then one could just skip that and think of a different item that the recipient would appreciate.

I don't know about you but I rarely mind getting duplicates of my favorite items. Backups.

What I do mind is getting something vaguely similar in a layperson's eyes and most likely of significantly lower quality. I collect pocket knives, and people caught on to that so I've received a few as gifts. Well-intentioned, thoughtful, utter crap, aside from the first knife I ever owned which was decent in my book; a little Leatherman Micra from Mom.

Buddy loves backgammon and only use those basic sets. 

As he is my bestfriend I bought that assface a custom handmade one from Turkey(FM Gammon) I know for a fact he would never have bought himself one that cost that much. 

His wife told me that she hates me sometimes because he tells her it was the best gift he ever got.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's amazing for coding. It's amazing for everything else.

I'm the biggest proponent of actually keeping the context of an LLM clean. I'm a proud context nazi. Like, whenever we get called by clients to optimize their shit, the number one reason their RAG or whatever sucks is because they literally fill their context with shit and then they wonder why the results are shit. It's the dev's responsibility to provide the LLM with an optimal state of its context so it can perform the best way possible. Anything else degrades the performance of the LLM and your app. So clean your fucking context!

But I know most devs are fucking lazy and would rather post strongly worded tweets about how stupid AI is because it can't find some simple info in their Confluence wiki. But it's not the LLM that's stupid in this case. It's you because you filled the context up with 15k tokens of garbage, not the AI. Good thing your suits paid for two weeks of consultation so I can remind you of that fact every day for the next two weeks.

https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1hh2lfc/please_stop_torturing_your_model_a_case_against/

Anyway, Gemini 2.5 is the first model that truly allows you to not give a fuck about your context and it still works perfectly up to its 1M token limit.

So it gets the context nazi's seal of approval.

It's also the first model that performs well over its whole context length. Most models write some fantasy number like 64k in their card and show some "needle in a haystack" graph, but after 2k tokens it's over. And surprise surprise, real world data behaves completely differently than needles, which are just some kind of LLM nutri-score.

Unfortunately, I have absolutely zero doubts that this just means the idiots of the world will fill it with 1M garbage tokens and still manage to tank its performance somehow. Well, at least my job is safe.

Also, whatever you do, DO NOT USE THE GEMINI APP VERSION.
I don't know what their system integrators are doing but it has nothing to do with integrating systems well, because they somehow manage to make the smartest model in the world act like some random 1B open source model from two years ago. It seems data you upload via the Gemini app doesn't get loaded directly into the context but gets "RAG"-ified or something. Also, it seems to be forced by a probably shit invisible system prompt to only answer half as detailed as the AI Studio version. Really stupid decisions.

Use the AI Studio version or the API.</div>

Everyone acts like it was so unfair that Carter was badgered into giving up his family’s peanut farm but it was absolutely 100% the right thing to do.

And there should be actual laws forcing elected officials to give up conflicts of interest. We shouldn’t continue to rely on the honor system in our government. There is no honor in American politics anymore, and there likely won’t ever be again. Nobody is forcing these rich assholes to run for office - if they don’t want to give up their businesses then they don’t have to run.</div>

See? This comic nails it. Every time a new medium emerges, people freak out and say, “That’s not art.” It happened with photography, it happened with digital painting, and now it’s happening with AI. History just keeps repeating itself.

Con:
Yeah, but there’s a difference. Photography and digital painting still involve a human making creative choices. AI-generated art feels more like outsourcing the creativity. Is it really the same thing?

Yes, anyone *can* use AI to make their own art. But that's not what most people are doing

They're asking for art created by a very gifted yet unusual artist named ChatGPT or Midjourney or StableDiffusion. Its fun, &amp; I don't really see it as evil or anything like that

But that doesn't mean you're the artist, unless you actually you know, did something. **Anything** 

Writing your commission down (the prompt), has to be truly comprehensive to reach creative agency, &amp; I just don't see it with these posts</div>

if your entire work is ai generated and all you're doing is manipulate prompts, that's also called art but it's most definitely not yours and you should credit 100% the ai.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’m not a fan of the way many AI bros flaunt their tools—“Look, I recreated your years of work in two minutes.” As if mimicry and speed somehow discredit craft. But what they fail to see is that by showing how easy it is to copy, they’re also showing how easy it is to be copied. No moat, no uniqueness—just an endless loop of replication.

They frame it as innovation, but it’s really commoditization. When everyone has access to the same tools, the real value isn’t in the output—it’s in the perspective behind it. What took years to build wasn’t just a style, but a way of seeing. And that still matters, even more so when the noise gets louder.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree, I see it similar to commissions.  If I ask someone for the picture and dictate how it looks and ask them to change it multiple times, I'm not the artist.  that doesn't change just because the artist is an AI.  AI makes great art, but the credit goes to the AI.  If I were to come half-way you could argue that people who do prompts are AI art directors, but I wouldn't say they're the actual artist because that would be the AI. 

Regardless, I'm still going to pay real artists for their work instead of using AI for anything more complex than basic images.  Artists aren't going to go away, and if anything AI just keeps them from having to make soulless corporate art for a living.  That will probably go to AI prompt directors.  I don't exactly see patreon artists struggling when they have a unique idea and roll with it, it just means they have to do more than generic art to make a living after AI takes over basic art tasks.</div>

if they figure out how to automate programming it opens the pandora box to automating just about everything else

just need the AI to train on how to properly do the job and it shouldn’t take too long to automate it

the only thing that might be hard is jobs that require very skilled manual labor e.g. surgeons, dentist, etc</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Not really. The thing with software development is that it is a much more verifiable task. Meaning, if you define the task perfectly, then the actual code writing can vary, but you can verify what the result will be. It's not so much the same with other stuff e.g. sales or design etc.

That's why Math and Coding are in the forefront, because you can actually test the results and have somewhat objective quality attributes of task completion.</div>

I don't think you even begin to understand the drop in number of farmers from the beginning of farming automation to now. The number of people required to farm was just staggering. Once we started to automate this lead to mass urbanization.</div>
