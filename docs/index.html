We’re a small team of devs from Qoder. With the mods’ permission, we thought it’d be fun (and useful) to do an AMA here.

A few weeks ago,we used our own autonomous agent (Quest) to refactor itself. We described the goal, stepped back, and let it run. It worked through the interaction layer, state management, and the core agent loop continuously, for about 26 hours. We mostly just reviewed the spec at the start and the code at the end. We’ve made good progress, and would ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">1. How much human involvement was there in this rewrite? Architecture, design, code reviews? 
2. I'm assuming you had to do a lot of prep before giving the control to the agent? What sort of prep was required? What pre-work did you do?
3. How do you manage context for such a long running and presumably huge context problem statement?
4. How did you test? Did the agent create its own test cases? From what I have seen, most LLMs create test cases in a way to pass the code they have written (usually, and unless handheld to avoid doing this), manipulate the test cases to ensure their code passes etc. How are you avoiding this?

                                <div class="reply-body">oh boy, lots of questions - let me break this down:

human involvement?

not zero lol. rough breakdown:

\- spec design: \~50% human

\- actual coding: \~20% human

\- code review: \~50% human

so yeah we didn't just yeet a prompt and walk away for 26 hours

prep work before handing over?

honestly the agent isn't magic - it can't just digest a massive context blob and figure everything out. we had to:

\- break the task into smaller functional chunks (each chunk = one task)

\- write detailed specs with acceptance criteria

\- review the agent's auto-generated plans before letting it run

think of it like onboarding a new engineer. you don't just say "refactor this" and disappear

context management for 26 hours?

this one's fun technically - we use SPEC decomposition to break into sub-tasks. system auto-compresses context as it goes, but keeps the important stuff (file paths, key state) through a reminder mechanism

basically: aggressive summarization + strategic reminders = not losing track after hour 15

testing / avoiding the agent gaming its own tests?

ok this is the spicy one 🌶️

few layers here:

1. agent generates tests based on SPEC, but we don't just trust those blindly

2. separate "review agent" cross-validates execution against acceptance criteria

3. we run third-party test frameworks too - not just the agent's own generated tests (that would be grading your own homework lol)

4. periodic sanity checks: agent compares actual results vs expected, triggers self-correction if things drift

is it perfect? no. but it's way better than "trust me bro" verification

what worked / broke / surprised us?

✅ worked: spec-driven execution kept things on track. agent kept checking back against spec instead of going rogue

❌ broke: some third-party framework integrations still needed human intervention. agent handles \~90% but that last 10% can be annoying

🤯 surprised: the self-correction loop actually... worked? when execution drifted from expected, it caught itself and fixed it. didn't expect that to be as reliable as it was

\---

tl;dr: it's not "fully autonomous" in the sci-fi sense. more like "autonomous with guardrails and a human checking in periodically. but those 26 hours of execution time? that's real work we didn't have to do manually</div>

Mature trees that are diseased will cost a lot to have removed.  “Weed” trees like the Tree of Heaven are invasive and will cause anguish and a lot of work.  Negotiate diseased and invasive tree removal in your purchase price.

Plant new trees as soon as you can when you buy a house. They take a while to grow, so the sooner you plant them the sooner you will realize the benefits.  Shade, beauty and increased value ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Holy cow, I wish I'd known more about the 'Tree of Heaven' before I bought. When I first saw them, I thought they were beautiful. We have dozens of gnarled old growth trees covered in moss. The property looked incredible, like straight out of a fantasy novel on a misty morning.

They have been the bane of my existence for the last two years. Despite having more than a dozen removed from close proximity to the house, two 'lower risk' trees have fallen in (separate) wind storms hitting the house. They spread by rhizome, which aggressively send shoots up EVERYWHERE when the primary growth is disturbed. Despite 100 degree temperatures and no rain this summer, those shoots grow nearly as fast as bamboo. 

They also stink. When cut or disturbed they smell like 'rancid peanut butter'. They shit copious quantities of pollen in the spring. 30% of people experience mild rashes on contact with leaves or sap. 

They feel nearly invincible. Hitting it with high dose herbicides is a crap shoot. I'm currently talking with an arborist who is exploring custom fungus which targets the root structure of the tree directly. Wish me luck.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Did one quick hallucination/instruction following test (ngl, the only reason why I'd consider this an instruction following test is because Kimi K2 and Grok a few months ago did *not* follow my instructions), asking the model to identify a specific contest problem without websearch (anyone can try this. Copy paste a random math contest question from AOPS and ask the model to identify the exact contest it was from without websearch and nothing else)

Kimi K2 some months ago took forever, because it wasn't following my instruction and started *doing* the math problem, and eventually timed out. 

Kimi K2.5 started listing out contest problems in its reasoning traces, except of course those contest problems are hallucinated and not real (I am curious as to if some of those questions it bullshitted up are doable or good...), and second guesses itself a lot which I suppose is good, but still confidently outputs an incorrect answer (a step up from a few months ago I suppose!)

Gemini 3 for reference *confidently* and I mean *confidently* states an incorrect answer. I know the thinking is summarized but it repeatedly stated that it was *absolutely certain* lmao

GPT 5.1 and 5.2 are the only models to say word for word "I don't know". GPT 5 fails in a similar way to Kimi 2.5. 



I do wish more of the labs try to address hallucinations.

On a side note, the reason why I have this "test" is because last year during the IMO week, I asked this question to o3, and it gave an "I don't know" answer. I repeatedly asked it the same thing and it always gave me a hallucination aside from that single instance and people here found it cool (the mods here removed the threads that contained the comment chains though...) https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1m60tla/alexander_wei_lead_researcher_for_oais_imo_gold/n4g51ig/?context=3</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Notice the gap the next time you have an impulse to check your phone. That urge can feel very strong but it’s actually possible to just notice it, and *stay with that feeling* of wanting to grab your phone, but not actually take action. Become curious about the textures of that urge sensation, and see if you can recognise that it’s actually just a feeling which you’ve been conditioned to associate with a particular response.

You can keep noticing this gap between the urge and the reaction (this can also apply to any other impulsive behaviours/habits/patterns of reactivity that you currently have). The more times you can remain in the gap without reacting, the more you start to weaken the link/automatic association between the urge to react and the reaction itself. 

If you can do this successfully with one conditioned habit, it will become a lot easier to apply the same method to other negative habits and reaction patterns that you also want to work on. With continuous practice, over time, you’ll get very good at 1) becoming mindful of the urge to react impulsively and 2) being able to stay with that urge and recognising that it’s perfectly ok to feel that sensation fully without trying to avoid it or needing to react. </div>

Not even "it doesn't problem solve as well as Opus" but rather it chokes, fails to call agents, and doesn't seem to generate code *most* of the time. Opus *always* generates code and I've never seen it fail to call an agent. And I'm just using the default, built in, presumably tested agents.

I'd welcome being told I was using it incorrectly, but so far I'm not impressed.</div>
