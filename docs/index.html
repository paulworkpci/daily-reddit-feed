The following submission statement was provided by /u/shogun2909:

---

SS: Representative Tim Burchett has been vocal about his belief that the government is withholding information about UFOs (or UAPs - Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) from the public. He recently urged the White House to disclose what they know, emphasizing the need for total transparency. Burchett has even introduced legislation to force federal agencies to release all documents related to UAPs.

                                <div class="reply-body">I believe if extraterrestrials were to openly present themselves, it would be a wake-up call to humanity about how we’re supposed to be living. The way we’ve built our societies around governments, power structures, and material control isn’t natural—it’s not the way we were meant to exist. In fact, if we look at how quickly we’ve advanced, it’s hard not to consider that we might be hybrids of humans and extraterrestrial beings, or at the very least, influenced by advanced intelligence that sped up our evolution far beyond what’s sustainable.

Governments and power elites were never meant to run us, especially in a world where we could be part of a greater cosmic community. If ETs are real and they choose to openly engage with us, it would reveal how insignificant these human-made systems of control truly are. We don’t need these structures to thrive—we need to reconnect with the truth of our existence, the bigger picture, and realize that there’s so much more beyond the borders we’ve created.

If we aren’t hybrids and we’ve advanced too quickly on our own, it feels like we’re on a path toward self-destruction. Our technology and capability to manipulate nature have outpaced our wisdom and collective consciousness. Without the guidance of a higher, more balanced intelligence—whether that’s from extraterrestrials or something greater—this unchecked growth will ultimately lead us to our downfall. We’ve forgotten what it means to live in harmony with the universe, and the consequence of that could be the unraveling of everything we’ve built.

An encounter with extraterrestrial beings would force us to confront that reality—our past, our mistakes, and the fact that we are not isolated in this universe. It could be a chance to shift the narrative and reclaim the natural, harmonious existence we were always meant for.</div>

That's the wrong question these days. 

Politicians, ESPECIALLY ones on the hard right, have learned that it's perfectly OK to lie. The truth almost never catches up, and when it does, it no longer matters. 

If he can get his face in a press conference, it's a win for him, regardless what he says. The people who believe in the conspiracy theories will love him, everyone else won't care enough to do anything.</div>

Every single friend of mine is knee deep in phone addiction. People I see on my commute are busy watching reels or shorts in public transport (sometimes without earphones). Barely anyone looks up from their phones. 

In social meetings/gatherings it is always "oh this cafe i saw on Instagram" or "did you watch this reel" or "do you want to do this trend".

2006: GW Bush is the greatest president in history. We had to go into Iraq and Afghanistan. The world is safer for it. If you dont agree, you hate the troops.   

2015: GW Bush is a RINO. He helped create ISIS. Trump is anti-interventionist. He will end the wars and wipe out terrorists.  

2025: Trump needs to invade Panama, Greenland, Canada, Mexico, and GAZA.</div>

The United States has long had the strongest military and any president could’ve threatened their way to any desired outcome with any country. They’ve all realized that you have to maintain relationships/global standing and not cause panic constantly threatening to do insane shit. This is much different than strong-arming someone in a real estate deal and never dealing with the dude again. All of these people will still be around after the deal is done, and people don’t just thank you for buttfucking them. 

We see why he’s alienated from so many people who dealt with him in years past. That’s not an acceptable outcome when you’re talking about centuries-old allies, other world leaders, and important people/institutions in the US.</div>

When the computer says “in a few words, describe your problem.” At that point, I start speaking gibberish. Something  like “Allgligblrrblrryie” The machine will ask you to repeat a couple more times and finally will say “I’m having a hard time understanding you. Let

                        <div class="comment-body">So, since alot of people here are debating this to be real or not, or sadly making the wrong conclusions, allow me to shed some light as someone living in the Netherlands.

1. A group of people have indeed started a juridical case against bill gates.
2. Prior to actually going into specifics, gates lawyers challenged the court case, saying the dutch court has no jurisdiction in the matter.
3. The court has ruled they do in fact have jurisdiction.

That is where we are at. The actual case will proceed at a later date.

He has not been found guilty yet. The court fees he has to pay are purely to compensate the other side for dragging them into the 'jurisdiction' battle and the costs they made over it.

This is the actual court decision, sadly in dutch, but google translate should mostly help you:

                                <div class="reply-body">it's deeper than that unfortunately:

the right are controlled by fundamentalist christian billionaires, it's why Speaker Johnson and Justice Alito both have "An Appeal to Heaven" flags in their offices and houses, they are part of the NAR movement (New Apostolic Reformation) which is basically a Christian supremacist ideology cooked up by some churches with some collaboration with the cia during the cold war ( to make a form of christianity that was less susceptible to socialist/communist messaging), it's the reason tucker carlson started talking about seeing physical demons on his show

they are doing this because they believe in dominionism, that they have a mandate for aggressive social transformation by any means necessary to create God's kingdom on Earth, that is why they are crippling the government and other institutions like universities - because our institutions are secular and guarantee rights for everyone regardless of identity or beliefs, freedom of expression etc

it's also why they are instigating conflicts with our european allies, because they are very socially liberal and mostly secular, same with the US led liberal world order - that doesn't allow for dominion

if you see the decline of the past 30 years through the lens of fundamentalist billionaires with authoritarian tendencies opposing the secular world order I think things come together to create a clear picture

\- Dan Wilks, Billionaire Texas oil tycoon (Frac Tech): funds the Daily Wire, PragerU, politicians, and NAR-aligned churches

\-Green Family (Hobby Lobby): Major contributors to politicians, prayer networks, and "spiritual warfare" movements

\-DeVos family: own Amway, The Orlando Magic, and Blackwater/Academi, former Sec of Education, support The Sentinel Group which does spiritual warfare theology, close ties to the CNP (council for national policy)

\- Uihlein Family: owners of shipping business uline, funds righwing sm network Turning Point USA

\-The Mercers: head of hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, fund the Daily Wire, Breitbart, Steve Bannon, The Blaze, Glenn Beck, and The Federalist

\-Peter Thiel is not technically NAR but is a fellow traveller and funds many of their projects

\-Ahmanson Family, cali based bankers, fund NAR-related media and political groups

\-Ken Eldred - silicon valley entrepreneur, founded Ariba Tech among others, funds marketplace ministries which is a key part of the Seven Mountains Mandate,

The Seven Mountains mandate is part of the core of the NAR chrisitan nationalist movement and advocates for christian control over the 7 mountains of society: family, religion, education, media, arts and entertainment, business, and GOVERNMENT</div>

Who else feels this way? If current products, especially Deep Research, just worked more reliably at their present capabilities, a significant part of the white collar economy would be impacted.

Even without agents, the levels of reasoning, intelligence, and information synthesis that we already have are more than sufficient to perform a lot of work. The problem is that they hallucinate so much that a competent human i...</div>

It's that humans on 20W of brain power can understand the context implied necessities of tasks, much of which in underlined by social relations, that keep AIs from being more useful. Essentially what you'll see happen is AI "interns" that function as juniors for highly specific tasks while continuously developing social relationships which will springboard them into making hyper efficient small teams and either leaning out or expanding the reach of present day companies.</div>

Keep in mind managers who may automate the jobs away themselves need to learn how this works, make decisions and implement.

                        <div class="comment-body">The reason the US doesn’t have enough doctors is because the government creates an artificial bottleneck on the number of new doctors each year. To become an attending in the US you have to go through US residency. The government pays for residency with Medicare and chooses how many seats are available. They have hardly touched the allotted number on the past 30 years. Last year 8000 MD medical school graduates did not get into residency. They are doctors who passed their boards, but cannot practice. Thats what central planning does.</div>

What that means is they are incentivized through transactions, rather than being right. 

A doctor can write you 3 scripts and 2 referrals and  they will get a positive performance review (in the eye of their hospital or insurance company. They don’t have to help you get better. They just have to pass you along to someone else. It’s a game of hot potato.

It’s a “good” problem to have…but it’s still a massive problem in terms of how people need to live.

Systems need to improve, and the people in charge of the systems need to be renaissance people…

Saying that we won't need humans for most things could have been considered "saying it out right" maybe 5 years ago, when that would have been thought of as a sci-fi scenario. But in 2025 "saying it out right" implies going one step further and explaining that both dystopian and utopian outcomes are possible.</div>

Just to be clear, I don't think AI will kill humans, I think that billionaires controlling AI won't need us anymore once all human jobs are automated and their walled garden is in place.

If two AI driven countries go to war - with fully automated AI armies - they will soon have to decide whether to commit limited resources into either feeding and housing a now useless population, or build more murder bots to keep up with the enemy's murder bots.

It kinda goes downhill from there...</div>

We spend one or two days a week together and any second he's not doing something that requires his attention like driving, he's on his phone. Even immediately after he stops driving and parks the car, he'll use his phone for a few minutes before I have to interrupt him so we can get going wherever it is we're supposed to be going.

                        <div class="comment-body">I had a similar issue with my wife and here’s what fixed it. I refused to share attention. If we were talking and she picked up her phone I would stop talking and wait. If she put the phone down I’d carry on. This very quickly turned things around. If she carried on with her phone I’d just go and do something else. She was annoyed at first but I just persevered and it’s no longer an issue.

ETA: it also works both ways and is an added incentive to foster reciprocal respect. If my wife starts talking to me I put my phone down, face down. This signals that I’m willing to give her my full and undivided attention and she is more important to me than whatever is on my phone.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I was married to a man I met the year the first iPhone was sold. Neither of us had smartphones for the first few years, but I watched him gradually turn into a phone addict. 


It sounds absurd to distill this entirely down to phone and Internet addiction, but we divorced in 2020. I couldn't handle it anymore, and the phone-internet behavior was almost like an indicator of his willingness to be on his own terms in every aspect of our relationship. It was like watching an adult regress into being a child. It was a heartbreaking arc but, my god, I do not miss being in the same room with the energy you describe in your post. It gave me a shudder of recognition, followed by a deep breath of relief. 


Hopefully this helps you address your own phone addiction, too. If you can see the bad parts of it in him, use that as motivation to see the bad parts in yourself *and to do something about it.* You're not in control of him—you're in control of you.</div>

And right before I start work I watch productivity-based vlogs of people being productive, working from their desks, having their life together.

you calling it "pre-work" is better than the name I've come up with... I have described this to other people as "focus foreplay".</div>

Keep adding a little bit each week until that first hour is filled with catching up on simple, mindless tasks. 

Maybe you'll find you're ready to work as normal after that time!

It's much better to wire your brain to get rewards AFTER doing some work rather than before. Now I just need to apply that to my own life better...lmao</div>

•	⁠President Donald J Trump

In 2016 a woman who went by the pseudonyms Katie Johnson and Jane Doe in legal filings accused Trump of raping her in 1994, when she was 13, during an orgy held at Epstein’s home in Manhattan. She accused Epstein of raping her as well.

Three suits were filed over the same allegations; the first was dismissed for failure to properly state a claim, and the other two were voluntarily dismissed. The third case was withdrawn just days before the 2016 election, and the accuser canceled a press conference at the last minute. Her attorney, Lisa Bloom, said the woman had received death threats and, “She has decided she is too afraid to show her face … She is in terrible fear.”

Edit: oh this one made you people mad lol.

It doesn’t have to be UBI, but there needs to be a plan. Reduced work weeks allowing multiple people to work the same job. More local jobs cleaning parks, that sort of thing. More military jobs. Who knows. Every country on Earth is going to handle this differently.

Software engineering is going to change, but not go away. In fact, there'll be more need for us than ever.

                                <div class="reply-body"> Greetings, brave soul! In case you were wondering, I'm Shrek. The big, green, grumpy ogre with a soft spot for donuts and a strong dislike for small talk. But since you seem to have stumbled upon my humble abode, allow me to regale you with some of my favorite stories.

Like that time I rescued Fiona from a tower, only to find out she had been turned into an ogre herself! It was quite the shock, but we somehow managed to find love in each other's eyes. Or that other time when I thought I was a duck. It's a long story involving a witch and an enchanted pond, but let's just say it ended with me chasing my reflection in a mirror and almost getting hit by a train.

So, tell me, dear friend - are you a fan of swamp creatures? And what's your favorite type of donut? Personally, I'm partial to the ones with sprinkles and filled with jam. They remind me of the times when I was still considered to be "clean on the inside." Ah, nostalgia.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I believe that no one is beyond help—except, perhaps, for kids who grow up entirely glued to screens with a dopamine addiction lol. But everyone has a starting point, and it's always possible to detox the brain from the constant dopamine rush.

Personally, I feel like I’m about halfway through my journey toward screen freedom. What has helped me the most is deleting all the apps that mindlessly fill the boredom void and allowing myself to actually be bored. Then, as a reward—or for a set amount of time—I use apps that aren’t as harmful as short-form content, preferably on a PC, making access slightly more intentional.

Yoga and mindfulness have also played a big role in helping me regain my lost attention span. Additionally, reading books on an e-reader has helped redirect my boredom toward something engaging that still requires mental effort.

Hope this helps, and stay strong!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I grew up in the countryside. Then moved into a city. Finally moved back to a more rural area. It's so nice to sit on my deck and not hear any signs of people. It's still a town, so there are occasional sounds, but there's not the constant drone of traffic, sirens, and everything else. Then at night, I keep my window cracked while sleeping so I just hear the crickets and frogs.

Oh, and coming home to my 2 big dogs just exploding with excitement, then wrestling, then bouncing around me, then wrestling some more, then bouncing around me again is so great. There's usually a cat perched somewhere, waiting for a scratch while trying to stay out of the way of 240 pounds of dog bumbling their way around.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The only hard part is that PDF is binary and Word (DOCX) is basically fancy XML in a compressed ZIP. Most LLMs are not trained on binary PDF data but with the PDFs converted to some text format ahead of time. But it doesn't have to be that way; an LLM is a Transformer in that it can learn to map \*any\* kind of inputs tokens to output tokens. If there's enough PDF -&gt; DOCX in the training set and the tokenizer supports binary encoding, then the LLMs can do it. The only hard part would be for the model compressing the DOCX in a ZIP, but it could be done because even compression is basically a learnable transformation.</div>

Right now they do navigation just like that except it's all on a screen instead of overlayed.  For tumors and stuff this could be very helpful and without navigation it would be very dangerous.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’m an anesthesiologist and this is already very commonly in use by neurosurgeons. It works a little differently than what is shown here. The operating location (brain or spine) is put into stereotactic space in the OR using those little pen with balls shown in the video. The image is then displayed on a big screen tv immediately in front of the OR bed. 

You can google “brainlab” for intracranial procedures and “stealthsystem” for spine surgeries.</div>
