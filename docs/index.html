                                <div class="reply-body">Learn to forgive/accept your self and others to fully appreciate the infinite potential within every moment and future moments. hell maybe the expectation/desire/hope that this moment should/could/would be any different than it is.

I'm not sure about meditation techniques as much as the realization that I'm in charge of my happiness and if I allow anyone to control my happiness with their actions or assumptions or opinions then I may never be happy/forgiving/accepting/understanding, It is empathy/compassion/awareness that allows me to deconstruct and understand my suffering/attachment which allows me to deconstruct and understand the suffering/attachment of others.

There is a concept called "dependent arising" in Buddhism which helps one realize one is a product of their surroundings, The more one understands the concept of dependent arising, the less likely they will to judge/condemn themselves and others, thus becoming more capable/willing to be in charge of their own happiness/acceptance within the ever present moment rather than allow others the opportunity/privilege to control/manipulate/change their thoughts/feelings/reactions.

                        <div class="comment-body">Absolutely. Yes! I‚Äôm trying to let it go and just let it be a memory (and I‚Äôm getting there), but my past nevertheless bothers me and also shames and embarrasses me to such an extent that it negatively impacts my present ‚Äî it makes me feel disabled and/or dysfunctional in a way, because I give that past (and how I operated and functioned during much of it) so much weight, so much relevance. I feel stigmatized basically. 

I was a very insecure, shy kid who went on to develop a social anxiety disorder that eventually led me to becoming severely depressed ‚Äî conditions which arose in my late teens and persisted through my young adulthood and now into middle age. And while I have improved greatly over the years and am no longer as disabled by those issues as I once was, I nevertheless feel so regretful and sorrowful over all the life that I lost or didn‚Äôt get to live because of my issues that I feel negatively impacted in the here and now. 

I see ‚Äúmyself‚Äù as being defined by how I lived during those very ugly and dark times. I was very dysfunctional and didn‚Äôt achieve much at all (because I was suffering and struggling), so now as a middle aged guy I am way behind where I feel I should be, and that feeling of being behind and also unsuccessful in life keeps that past front and center in my mind ‚Äî it‚Äôs as if my current life situation feels tethered to and defined by what once was, and this makes it very difficult to ‚Äúlet that past go.‚Äù

I guess because I feel in part that I am still fundamentally the same guy who was struggling back then. I felt defective back then, and I feel defective now. So the past is still my present. It‚Äôs hard to articulate into words, however.</div>

I had a toxic work place, no support circle to fall back on, heart aches and what not. And my mind would move in loops with every small trigger but yoga, meditation, breath watching have helped me immensely. It gave me the courage and clarity to quit  my toxic work place and switch.  

My relationship handling skills have improved by far. It's been life transforming for me. Though I'm far from perfect but really far more joyfull üôè</div>

There‚Äôs a saying from somewhere (Ferriss, maybe?) that essentially says ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not addicted to something, you just haven‚Äôt found your molecule yet.‚Äù We‚Äôve all got a molecule, and AI stands to serve up an infinite number of them.

Sure it can be porn, but it can also be a music genre that stopped being popular decades ago that you love, Star Wars novels that pick up where you wished they would, bringing childhood pictures to life in immersive video‚Ä¶ every single one of us probably has a thing that AI will be able to produce, and it‚Äôll be hard to turn away. 

There‚Äôs an excellent argument to be made that our brutal conquering of boredom is a serious problem. I love AI, but I don‚Äôt see how that problem doesn‚Äôt get exponentially worse.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm personally less concerned about infinite novelty, and more concerned (for myself) about an advanced AI that figures out "my molecule" in cinematic form (I'd include high-production value television in that).

There's some ineffable quality that I can't quite put my finger on, about some movies and tv shows that I find very compelling, but I feel like they've only scratched my itch 10%. If any algorithm ever figures out what makes me tick, and can create an open-ended world/story with really compelling characters, themes, stories, visuals, music, etc., such that it scratches my itch 50-100%, I can imagine myself having a very hard time pulling myself away from it.

At least with good TV, the season eventually ends, and it takes them a year or two to create the next season. But with genAI, it could literally be rendering the final product in real time at 24fps, with no end, ever, and it just keeps getting better and better, and more and more addictive.

It's kinda scary.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes.  What is your goal?  Codex CLI has a MCP function.  It didn‚Äôt support Claude Code, but if you look for a PR under my name you can find a link to the changes I used. I haven‚Äôt pushed a release for the latest version, but if there is interest I can.  It‚Äôs pretty neat.  The most effective way to use it is to create an agent and explain how to use it and then tell Claude why to call the agent.

Using Claude in Codex is a little more of a pain.  Codex CLI uses a sandbox (at least on macOS) that messes with even MCP permissions.  I did write some stuff to make it work, including a bridge MCP instead of a direct one, but ultimately I was never happy with it and I don‚Äôt think I published it.  

I‚Äòve been using Codex alone mostly lately and getting better results.  I need to try to fiddle a little more :)</div>

Ball goes on at some length about the nano technology that is possible and actually exists and cites examples of such that are based on biological systems. 

What he criticizes is very specifically Drexler's nanoassemblers and points out that real science does not support their feasibility at all.</div>

Nowhere in this long article did he even bother to give an actual argument for why human-level AI is in the category of "oneiric technologies" that probably can't exist like perpetual motion machines and Drexlerian nanobots. It's probably a good thing he didn't, because the only way he could have is to argue that human intelligence is magical and special and precious, which is the exact form of superstitious wishful thinking he accuses Silicon Valley of engaging in, just flipped around.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Look, I know that anything short of total optimism about AI is frowned upon in this sub. I want AGI to be around the corner as much as anyone. But this article is a well-formed argument that needs to be addressed. The author is not, as some of the commenters here are saying, asserting that because one technology didn't work out, none of them will. He's making a very specific and reasonable argument that the *cause* of people being wrong about Drexlerian nanobots is also present in how people talk about AGI, and that's entirely true. It's one thing to say "there is a specific chemical process, and it seems reasonable that this process could be used to manipulate atoms in a way that leads to new technologies"; it's something else entirely to say "wouldn't it be cool if we could do anything we want with atoms?" What the author is saying here is that the way people talk about AGI is more like the second and less like the first.

If you want to respond to this article, it's not enough to say that the writer is simply rejecting all positive predictions about AI. You have to be able to explain the *mechanism* by which AI will do all the amazing things you're predicting. And I'm not saying that it won't! All I'm pointing out is that I'm constantly seeing people on this sub complaining about how no one listens to them and no one knows what's coming, and the way the commenters here are responding to this article is exactly why that happens.

A good response to this article would be something like: the author is wrong that AI is a pipe dream, because X specific property will lead to Y specific technological/societal outcome in a reasonable amount of time because of Z principles. The author claims that A will never happen, but B finding shows that it's actually in the realm of possibility.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree. I tasked people with trying to find the AI music hidden in between real music (that they did not know). They *where* still better then chance (my sample was very small, both in people and in songs), it was about 60/40, but with the speed this is going, it's basically a done deal this year.


Try it out yourself. Grab random music in a genre and generate music with the latest model in the same genre. Go ahead and cherrypick, we are not saying *every* ai generated song will pass the Turing test yet. Make a small playlist.


Randomly shuffle the music and let people listen and guess.


Depending on your prompting technique your milage may very, but it's somewhat fun (and horrible) to see their faces sink when they realise how difficult of a task this is becoming.


Also have tissues on hand. One of my relatives had a bit of a crisis as she was thinking of a young friend who is trying to become a musician.</div>

Male, aged 53.  5'9", weight 220 lbs.  Out of shape my whole life.  Worked at desk jobs.  I'm a vegetarian.

I have sciatica and a lower back sensitivity.  (Was injured many years ago, and it's still a little sensitive. The sciatica is related.)  Knees are sore, so activities like crawling are painful.

Money is not an issue.  Time -- I can make the time for 2/week sessions easily.  Daily sessions are possible, but would ta...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If you‚Äôre interested in the workouts, the best way to find out is to drop into a local gym and talk with the coaches/owner about your goals, and see how it works. Contrary to popular opinion, CrossFit is infinitely scaleable. I have coached everyone from 22-year old former college athletes to 50-something women who are afraid to pick up a 35# bar, and every person I‚Äôve seen has made significant improvements by showing up and putting in the work. As far as your back issues, they may limit some of the movements, and that might be worth talking to a doctor about, but a good coach can give you scaling options for almost any exercise.</div>

Most boxes will let you do a free intro class or at least chat with coaches beforehand about modifications. Your back stuff might actually benefit from getting stronger but obviously listen to your body and maybe check with your doc first

  
The accountability aspect is huge too, that's honestly one of the best parts about it. When people are expecting you to show up it's way harder to skip</div>

I haven't seen this mentioned here yet, but Japan has had far more access to the Prelude for whatever reason. So far the impressions seem positive. You can use YouTube's translation features if you don't speak Japanese.

It will probably be considered a success if it moves a few thousand units a year. I expect it to be more expensive than people want, but so is everything else.

We should be happy that Honda is making an interesting and different runabout. This style of car doesn‚Äôt exist much anymore.

Feels almost like this recipe is closer to a Mazda 3 Turbo. Different tradeoffs, better fuel economy and fewer doors. But kind of that same low key GT concept that‚Äôs kind of cool that people struggle to classify.</div>

I don't discuss personal issues with GPT5, I use it to brainstorm a sci-fi book idea, help me find the reason I have the interests I have and how they correlate to taste in music, movies, series, books etc. and it will suggest things that fit into that profile, and I've used it to assess a plethora of different topics to which it will give a relatively neutral an unbiased reply. 

I can clearly see why lonely people can get "attached" to this thing, or people who lack confirmation in their lives. etc. even if my own use is verry different.</div>

Loving it to the point of being unable to criticize it seems, to me, as unproductive as being an "AI hater". 

AI is powerful, but it is also very damaging.</div>

The math just does not work, the young don't have enough literal hours to care for the old.

Understand that "care" is any kind of services that an old person needs (electricity, water, groceries, healthcare, house cleaning, construction, etc, etc)

This is the problem with pensions, people think you can "fix them" politically one way or the other, you can't. Either you multiply productivity 10x or old people have to keep working to self-sustain, there is no other solution.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">china also have another motivation: to keep manufacturing monopoly in their hand. chinese population starting to shift into higher paying white collar jobs and working age popuation percentage is dropping. they either lose cheap labor to countries like india along with their monopoly, or make robots cheaper than anyone and keep the monopoly. even though china is shifting to service economy, being the worlds factory is so priceless a political power to hand over.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">No, because South Korea has:

1. Highly accessible, high quality universal healthcare
2. Cheap and excellent public transportation
3. Low rates of crime
4. High levels of educational attainment
5. Freedom of political protest and many active grassroots political organizations
6. Rule of Law where sitting presidents get impeached for wrongdoing and CEOs of large corporations routinely go to prison

Korea has many problems, but it as a **state** is nowhere near as much of a cyberpunk dystopia as people like to make it seem.

Many of the big, highly-publicized problems in Korea right now (extreme competition, poor work-life balance, low birth rates, high elderly suicide rates) are cultural in nature and largely self-afflicted by the **nation** of Korea. Korean culture is ruthlessly competitive.</div>
