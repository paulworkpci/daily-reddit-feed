"Yeah, I suppose so."

"Well, you can't control what Musk or Trump do, and that's why I will REMAIN VIGILANT of their actions. You can close your eyes and plug up your ears. I won't."

I think there is a middle way. Constantly worrying and talking about these things isn't useful. However, completely ignoring stuff when shit hits the fan is also not useful. That's like being a passive willful victim. We need an appropriate amount of energy spend on things according to their importance.</div>

If something is directly affecting you then take the appropriate actions to ensure things move forward in a desirable way for you. Constantly stressing over some executive order or action that you dont like that has some remote chance of affecting you but not really is obsessive and unhealthy.</div>

I got a friend who strongly believe in "feminine" and "masculine" energies of men and women. That if you dont cultivate your right "energy" it can lead to physical diseases and shit. When i ask about proof she goes on to show me a youtube channel of a guy who lives alone in a forest and talks about this stuff.

For example: his grandparents (from mother's side) were literal Canadian Nazis that had to emigrate to South Africa, because of their fucked up political beliefs. And Elon spent a lot of time with them, because his deranged father didn't give a shit about the children. Or his expulsion from PayPal. Or his bullshit claims about Mars missions, Tesla's Robotaxis, Solar City etc. Sociopathic conman with a God complex - that's what he is, which makes him a very convenient tool in the hands of bigger guys.

Like literally, there are some puzzles you can gather and make a picture of Elon himself - still, unless his techno-bros friends will decide to help him and clean his image on the internet as much as they can.</div>

He’s backing **JD Vance, who has openly cited Curtis Yarvin’s anti-democracy ideas.**
**Thiel’s Palantir** already has deep ties with **the Pentagon &amp; surveillance agencies.**
If you think this is just another election cycle, **think again.**

Submission Statement: During a UFC interview with Georges St-Pierre, a mysterious disc shaped object appears spontaneously in the background, hovers for a moment, and zooms off at incredible speed. In light of a recent interview with George's, I find this footage relevant. I'm curious if he's aware it even exists.

What I keep hearing: 

* Content (video) creation is becoming more sophisticated, using more expensive tools, compared to what existed in, say, 2014 and before. 

* The cost and effort required are way beyond what ordinary users are able or willing to invest. 

* Payoff per unit of investment have reduced over time, unless one gets brand deals. 

...all of which goes to show that there is a clear divide between content creators and content consumers. Leading to youtube at least, becoming a giant content feed.

                        <div class="comment-body">I think people are changing their spaces. TikTok especially has had significant growth over the past few years.

Bluesky is still relatively small with 30 million users, but it's enjoying success too as people continue to migrate from Twitter.

School bans on mobile phones are growing as well, which will reduce usage.

I do think a lot of people are getting fed up with the contemporary internet. But they may just be reducing time online rather than completely walking away.</div>

Too addicted to get off the internet but at the same time, yeah some are actually over it. Funny how the media portrays it as "Hey everyone is addicted to their phones they should get off" and now the desired story, will become "No one is online anymore"</div>

                <div class="post-content">Ever since I was a little kid, I had HIGH expectations of myself. When I didn't accomplish a goal, I would feel guilty and punish myself.

Spoiler, he's just proposing an alternative way of treating addiction for people already in treatment for addiction. It's not a "we're shipping everyone on these list of meds to a labor camp" like the post implies.

It's voluntary, free and an option instead of serving jail time for drug offenses (which has already been in places for ages.)</div>

You’re forced to sit there, many times with no internet access, for weeks while doing essentially nothing. That’s bad because many people’s trigger is boredom. If you give them something to do to distract their mind, it’ll be easier to ignore the cravings.</div>

Perplexity was one of the first popular chatgpt wrappers, and Sam has said time and time again that those type of companies are going to get steamrolled as the models get better and better until the wrappers lose their unique features.

He's basically constantly pushing his own hype, talking about how perplexity is better for searching stuff than google, and better for LLMs than openAI.

Obviously both of those statements are false, but he's managed to keep enough engagement going, and that's all he really cares about.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You are one of very few people who are thinking properly. People claim AI is different from human intelligence, or it will create new jobs. It won't create new jobs (after a point) because any job it creates will be doable by AI agents too. Also, artificial neurons are essentially performing the same task our brains perform. Only difference is in efficiency. Our brains spend 3 watts while AI spends 3000 watts, but that is just an engineering challenge which will improve over time. In conclusion, we are all cooked. We should all make our money while we can. I secretly hope that some movement or uprising occurs to slow down this process. I understand that old and rich people want to accelerate it in hopes that AI creates a age-reversing cure or immortality. But this incentive will drive income inequality to unprecedented levels, creating a dystopia. UBI also doesn't seem practical without a one-world government, otherwise the investors move to another country. Man, we are playing with fire..</div>

The “corruption” we’re supposed to be worried about is working class Americans having government jobs? I know people being impacted by Elon’s crusade who worked meaningful jobs. It’s not going to stop. Everyone will know someone impacted, and it won’t be someone paid $3 mil/year for some bullshit DEI job. 

The VA is being gutted. Veterans are 1/3 of the federal workforce. Their unemployment will skyrocket. The Dept of Ed doesn’t just create curriculum. People will lose the ability to become educated or learn a trade. Prices will go *up* with all of these trade wars. Is this what everyone signed up for? They’re getting revenge at our expense and gutting the country/economy. This is all so fucked.</div>

You feel like every thought and memory you ever had was just scanned and analyzed and you feel completely vulnerable. That was my experience at least.

But the experience of being outside your body in that moment is just…unexplainable. It feels more real than real. Like you’ve been living your whole life seeing through your cell phone camera and you’ve just opened your eyes for the first time.</div>

I’ve heard others say OBE’s feels more real than real life… Also heard that a lot from people who have had a NDE. 

When you had this, complete communication, what kind of entity was it with? Can you tell more about your experience?</div>

The other thing I like to do is listen to a single album every time I go somewhere. Metric's Synthetica will forever remind me of Utah, Elliott Smith's From a Basement on a Hill will always remind me of Portland (fittingly), Nirvana by Nirvana will always be associated with driving to meet my senior prom date that lived a town over.

Whatever you can do to link your memory to the experience, do it. Sometimes it's nail clippers or shot glasses or hats or music or socks or just taking a picture of the sunset. 

When you leave it will just be a memory. Do whatever you can to preserve it.</div>

Writing code in 30s by an Ai datacenter is way more efficient than spending 4 hours of electricity on your home computer. That's a small scale example. On a big scale we can take a look at alphafold2. Before Ai, they spent 20 years of datacenter compute to find 140k proteins structures while in 1 years with Ai they found the 220 MILLIONS remaining ones.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You're correct, but this IS cherrypicking. AI uses in professional fields like that are wonderful and valid, alphafold2 is a shining example. You can make strong arguments for efficiency there, because it's a goal humans have been working towards for ages. 

However, consider layman usage. Consider AI image generation. By your above argument, every AI image generated would've been created by other means, primarily manual labour. The availability of the technology has caused an explosion in usage and in creating content that 1) wouldn't have existed otherwise, and 2) is absolutely NOT something that's important, practically speaking, like usage in medical or industrial fields.

Plus, Altman is making a huge false equivalency here. Leaky pipes and ChatGPT are not the same. Burgers and ChatGPT are not the same. They don't address similar needs, fulfill similar goals, represent similar issues, or anything, aside from the fact that "water is involved in their production". But all of that aside, this graph to point out how little impact ChatGPT has environmentally is bonkers - burgers (red meat) are absurd consumers of water, and leaky pipes are a major infrastructural flaw. Again, cherrypicking. And "Other Thing Is Worse" is a terrible, terrible defense.

Lastly please consider that Altman is probably a *little* biased. As are folks who are staunchly anti-AI in every form! The reality is almost always somewhere in the middle, but I at least hope that you, dear lovely nerd reading this (I'm now talking to the whole room apparently lol), will approach things with skepticism. Cuz this really is a bad chart.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Energy use isn’t a problem either 

According to the International Energy Association, ALL AI-related data centers in the ENTIRE world combined are expected to require about 73 TWhs/year by 2026 (pg 35): https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/18f3ed24-4b26-4c83-a3d2-8a1be51c8cc8/Electricity2024-Analysisandforecastto2026.pdf




Global electricity demand in 2023 was about 183230 TWhs/year (2510x as much) and rising so it will be even higher by 2026: https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-consumption



So AI will use up under 0.04% of the world’s power by 2026 (falsely assuming that overall global energy demand doesnt increase at all by then), and much of it will be clean nuclear energy funded by the hyperscalers themselves. This is like being concerned that dumping a bucket of water in the ocean will cause mass flooding.

Also, machine learning can also help reduce the electricity demand of servers by optimizing their adaptability to different operating scenarios. Google reported using its DeepMind AI to reduce the electricity demand of their data centre cooling systems by 40%. (pg 37)

Google also maintained a global average of approximately 64% carbon-free energy across their data and plans to be net zero by 2030: https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/google-2024-environmental-report.pdf</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Oh I’m sorry to hear you’re feeling like this. It definitely sounds like you have some depression likely brought on by phone addiction. I can empathise because I’m feeling exactly the same. Today I had plans to leave the house, go to the gym and run a few errands but I have been so lazy and still not left the house and it’s 4:20pm and I’ve been pretty much on my phone most of the day. I never used to be like this but I got a puppy 18 months ago so I naturally was spending more time in the house because of this and I then have gradually been using my phone more.. and have felt this depression/ laziness creep up on me over the last year.
I’ve been looking into it recently and Smart phone addiction is way more common than we think. They’re designed to give you those little dopamine hits that you should be getting from completing tasks and activities with friends/ family etc. 
Make sure to sure to give yourself compassion and grace as you would a friend.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hmm.. Using a phone is nothing wrong if you were to put it in good use. Like reading up or picking up new skills. Balance is the key. Perhaps u can read up some psychology books and try to find out what makes you feel that your life is miserable.

Everyone lives only once, the most important thing for anyone in my opinion is that you must live the way you want it to be. Ultimately nothing wrong to be sloppy at home and looks well groomed outside. Stop the self criticism and more self love. 

There is no right or wrong in this world and people just love to set a definition for everything. The first word that you wrote "I hate my life....." Maybe you can try with "I am grateful that my life ..." (:</div>
