On a parenting forum, I read the phrase "Don't punish the behaviour you want to see." For example, if you want your teenager to spend more time with the family, don't make snarky comments like "Well, look who finally decided to show up" when they actually do. Rather, you should use positive reinforcement for behaviour you want to encourage ("It's nice to see you!") and save punishments/consequences for behaviour ...</div>

It can be really tempting to devote attention to the kids who are playing up and being ‘naughty’, but it’s so much better to redirect to the children who are doing the right thing, and gush over them with praise and stickers and rewards while ignoring the ones playing up.

It really, REALLY works to get the other ones to calm down because they very quickly realise that they’re only going to get your attention if they’re ‘good’.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My dog was runner as well and this is what we quickly discovered about him. He would jump our old gate and go running through the neighborhood, and two things were sure to happen if you did them. 

1. Yelling at him would make him run away
2. Running after him after having yelled will result in a longer chase

The minute I realized that if I just playfully called him and walked toward him, he would literally stop and let you grab him. He doesn't run anymore but he's the same way about all discipline. A calm "Hey stop that" goes much further than yelling.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly!! Also, I never use my dogs name when he’s bad, I never want him to associate his name with bad behavior. For example, I walk him off leash all the time - people praise us for how well he does off leash because he stops when I ask and he comes and stands next to me when I ask. This is in large part because when I need to him to stop I say HEY! Or WAIT! And he learned those words. So when I call his name (Bean) it’s good natured and he genuinely knows it’s to come to me because it’s usually met with a high value treat. I don’t remember where I learned this tip but so often people say their dogs name if they’re being bad or running away and it’s angry, and dogs respond to tone! I truly feel this is why I have such a responsive dog (plus we worked on recall a ton bc we live in NH and I leave him off leash almost everywhere).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Amusingly, my wife and I  taught our dog to come with an harsh, concerned tone in the command.

Basically we figured the scenarios we'd need to call him were likely to be stressed out ones.

So, harsh tone, lots of treats and love. Just scares visitors a bit when we call him over to hop up and cuddle on the couch.</div>

I love functional fitness, and CrossFit programming is perfect for what I want to do. However, after trying 4 different gyms, I'm struggling with the group class format. They feel rushed (next class is always waiting), and I end up feeling like I'm not getting optimal training time. I also don't always want to train at the high intensity that typically comes with CrossFit—a few days a week, I'd prefer to swap the WOD for s...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">What are your goals? 

Did group classes exclusively for about 1 year. Switched to a solo competitive program and now workout by myself. I’ll hop into class sometimes. I’m also a coach so I still am involved. We use PRVN. 

I made the switch because I wanted to get better competitively and I needed to make personalized adjustments to my training to keep improving. That and doing CrossFit type intensity classes 5 days a week is not good for gains. Need that zone 2 and accessory work. But it’s not fun so it’s not programmed. 

I tell my group class members this all the time: 

Eventually, you’ll reach a point where if you want to improve on something you’ll need to put in extra workout outside of class. Even just 15min before or after to work on something makes a huge difference. That’s how I learned a lot of skills. We all hit a wall somewhere. As a coach, I can only give so much time and attention to each member in a big class. And while you can make a TON of progress just going to class, sometimes you gotta put in extra work or just accept where you’re at. 

Unfortunately finding boxes that have open gym to allow independent training are tough to find! Good luck 👍.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You could give me The Rock's personal travel gym that's like a million dollar setup. You could give me every fitness contraption ever invented and an unlimited pass to every globogym in the world and I would literally never touch it. The only reason I go to a CrossFit gym is to workout with other people doing the same thing. You could set me up with the Drago's gym from Rocky 4 and I wouldn't even put down my beer... But if you were like "I bet you can't flip this dirty-ass tire more times than I can." I'd spend three fucking hours trying to beat you. 

I have no idea why people would join a group fitness model to work out by themselves.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That's not the real irony.

If I got invited to perform in front of royals, and couldn't make fun but I wanted to anyway, I might use trump as a springboard to make jokes about kings.

If I wanted to critique their culture but wasn't allowed to, I might critique my own in such a way that it indirectly sheds light on theirs.

The real irony is being a fan of comedy and thinking you can gauge the full scope and intent of a live performance by reading a broken up version of it, totally out of context, in a clickbaity hit piece.

An article:
"And then Carlin said if we want to get serious about saving the planet we need to go to the cemeteries and dig up the bodies and throw them into the river"

Everyone:
wow I always knew he was a disgusting person with no regard for human life.

AI can generate and refactor code insanely fast, but without strong test automation you’ll drown in regressions. And here’s the trap: if you use AI to generate tests directly from your existing code, those tests will only mirror its logic. If your code says 2+2=6, your AI-generated test will happily confirm that.

The better approach:
	• Generate acceptance tests from requirements/PRDs, not from the code.

All of the models listed are really good (haven’t tested 4.6 yet) but it feels like the 2 closed options have always worked the best for me. 

It’s also possible that because I haven’t given the others as much opportunities it’s skewing things for me. 

Either way, it’s amazing all of the open and closed source choices we have, several free or dirt cheap.</div>

This is a company that doesn't cater to normal cliënts even within the Hyper/Mega car world.

This is a company that's known for making cars that go well into the 5 milion + range.

With cars like the Agera RS1 being valued at $10 Million

And a company that was also  angry when a One:1 was valued at $1.8 million to  $2.37 million, By Bonhams during Pre-auction estimates.

Several of their (known ) cars like the Naraya and Jesko Odin Have Real  Gold and Diamond plating.

Affordable to them means making a car 500k to 700k. (Without options )

So that it can be used a bit more often the other cars. In their cliënts massive garages (plural )

Just look at the drag races and tests influencers and YouTubers have done with these cars. The results are all over the place. Problems show up everywhere: software glitches, engine quirks, gearbox issues… there’s always at least one thing that isn’t working 100% reliably. No wonder Koenigsegg avoids handing their cars to magazines or the press.

I know a good amount of people who never managed to enjoy mindfulness due to *this one* aspect, and I experienced it as an issue in my own practice a few years ago.

It's so much better to focus on *being a meditator*, rather than pressuring yourself to get into the practice. Allowing mindfulness to become part of **you**, not your **routine** is the key...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hard disagree. 

A meditator is someone who meditates. If you want to get into meditation, you will need to meditate. Consistently. 

Meditating once every few days or once a week, while it will provide some benefit and is better than nothing, will provide far less benefit compared to meditating every day.

What's better: meditating once per day for 5 minutes, or once per week for 35 minutes? 

Meditation is not a chore. Consistently meditating is not a chore. Like anything else it is a habit.

Read Atomic Habits if you have problems with instilling habits and sticking to them.

----

In a nut shell, all you need to do is decide to start meditating after some event you already do consistently. For example perhaps after dinner, you will floss, then brush your teeth, then sit down to meditate. 

To start, literally go meditate for 1 minute, and then get up and doom scroll on tiktok or whatever you do.

After 2-3 days then increase it to 5 minutes. After 7 days maybe double it to 10 minutes, and so on and so forth.

If there is some day that you have a hectic schedule and cannot meditate after dinner, the key thing to remember is that you are going to sit down and meditate even if you only do it for 5 seconds. 

Your body acts on inertia. If you do it this way you will keep the inertia up and it will be trivially easy to consistently meditate.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly. It is like exercise. There are many ways to do it and intensities, and these bring different results.  If you have been sedentary for a long time then starting with a walk is a great first step but if you want to get really fit and build muscle, then more specific, intense and consistent workouts are necessary.

I do like OPs comment about not treating it like a chore, though. You can have discipline without it feeling like a burden or something you have to get through.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thanks so much for your thoughts. I agree that when learning any skill, practice matters. I see a lot of people struggle with motivation around meditation, and they give up their practice because they can't sit for 30 minutes daily. I think practicing short glimpses, daily, even for a couple seconds is a great way to maintain your practice with consistency, without putting too much pressure on yourself. 

My personal view is that meditation is more enjoyable when it is viewed as the *opposite* of a chore. 

Doing the dishes is a wonderful time for practicing mindfulness :)</div>

I also experience occasional "hits" like this where AI is a definite time saver. The thing is, there are a lot more "misses" where the AI gets stuck, starts hallucinating, or otherwise becomes more trouble than it's worth. One example of success really doesn't mean much.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree. People who say they want to “bring back” a *Leave it to Beaver* society are morons, because they don’t actually know what they’re talking about. They’re cherry-picking a TV fantasy that never really existed. Even for white Americans, the so-called “golden age” was full of poverty in places like Appalachia, factory workers trapped in debt, veterans struggling with untreated trauma, and strict conformity that punished anyone who didn’t fit the mold.

Ethnic white groups like Italians, Irish, and Poles still faced prejudice, Catholics and Jews were discriminated against, and many white families couldn’t afford the suburban dream the government was subsidizing for others. So when people act like the 1950s were perfect, what they’re really longing for is a Hollywood script, not reality.</div>

A really cool thing to do is wrap books you like to give as gifts. I would have them wrapped and then put a sticky note on it so I knew which book it was.</div>
