He said something like *”Visiting is not the ONLY way to learn but it is certainly the BEST way.”* That feels like such a load of shit. How would talking to a biased sample group of citizens improve my understanding of the conflict? Why would touring the sites of the atrocities give me a grounded perspective?

It would probably do *the exact opposite.*</div>

The beijing half-marathon where humanoids were supposed to compete on the 15th was [postponed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/worlds-first-humanoid-robot-half-marathon-postponed-due-windy-weather-2025-04-10/#:~:text=The%202025%20Beijing%20Yizhuang%20Half,Thursday%20by%20the%20event's%20organizers) to the 19th because of the weather.

If that version of the G1 is the one they'll use with that speed, then they have a very good chance at winning.  
That's not 100% sure though, the PM01 from engineAI is pretty damn fast as well.

That's assuming both companies will participate and that their humanoids can handle that kind of speed for a sustained period of time without having their actuators overheat too much. It looks like they are really maxing out their hardware.</div>

Like there's not a single thing people can do without a million rageful little eyes watching it.

                        <div class="comment-body">What I do is I just don't keep data on my phone, in addition to not having any social media apps on there. It's basically like having a flip phone (no internet access as soon as I go outside) but I still have access to convenient apps like Google Maps. If I want music, I load up my own music files onto it like it's an iPod.

As someone who was around in the 90s and 2000s, I can't emphasize how great modern technology is, but I think it requires some mindfulness in order to not go insane. I try to just think of my phone as a tool, not as a dopamine machine.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I've been trying to slow down too and cut my doomscrolling - I deleted all of my social media (Facebook, insta, etc...) but noticed that I would then just scroll Youtube for hours.

Here's at least how to cut Youtube at the knees so that the doomscrolling is no longer a problem:

-turn off watch history to turn off recommended videos (when you scroll past a video it's just a black screen that says "turn on watch history to get recommendation"). It's definitely a pain to not have a record of what all I've watched but I try to like videos I want to come back to. 

-enable restricted mode to hide all comments. I, personally, am someone who ALWAYS gets more activated from reading comments. This one is also a pain because videos with boobies or swears get blocked and you have to open them in a separate incognito tab. But still workaroundable.

These changes have revolutionized how I use my phone. When I go on Youtube I CAN'T start auto scrolling. I have to intentionally seek out videos and creators to watch. When I open my phone it's to read e-books, respond to texts, check email, look something up, or watch a youtuber I enjoy. I have found more time to paint, read, dance, exercise, pay attention to nature... it feels great. 


Other things that have been bringing me intense slow-living joy:

-learning what kind of birds live near my home so that I can identify them when I see them. Also identifying what kind of food they enjoy so I can tempt certain breeds to my yard.

-not listening to audiobooks anymore - I used to read 70-100 books a year. Then I read "Let Us Now Praise Famous Men" which was one of the most beautifullly written books I've ever read and I fundamentally realized audiobooks were robbing me (who is NOT an auditory learner) of fully engaging with the material. I now average about 20-30 books a year but I also feel like I've massively engaged with the ones I have read.

-Read "Thinking Fast and Slow" - recognizing that our society is training us to rely on our most basic knee-jerk instincts with constant stimulation has helped show me where I need to re-train my "slow" brain that is intentional and thoughtful.

-Keeping plants or a garden - I bought a few orchids from the grocery store and have kept them alive for over a year. The joy I feel caring for them and keeping track of their leaves, flowers, buds, etc... is so groundbreaking.

-Keeping a sourdough starter alive. Feeding something that feels totally alien and keeping it alive and kneading bread you make from that alien creature is so fun. I love feeding it and watching it start to bubble up.

-Having the expectation for regular phone calls and hangouts with friends - I tell my friends up front I will text them back within 1-3 business days and that if they want quality time, I'll always respond to texts to schedule a phone call or hangout immediately. I made a goal for myself in 2022 that I would see a friend in-person at least once a week.</div>

Every year, my husband and I sit together and find our best photos of the year and get them printed then spend a few hours labeling them with the dates and general context and putting them into an album. My mom used to make beautiful scrapbooks, I'd love to get on that level one day but I've contented myself with big binders that have about 4 slots for photos on each page.

bottom line, it's not realistic.  it's LARPing.  it's playing dress-up.  it's not how the world works.  it's a horse and carriage--charming, antiquated, and completely anachronistic.  you can still use it, but that's What You Do Now.  That's your Thing, is "flip phone guy."  you'll be actively expending energy to uphold that lifestyle at the expense of things that interest you.  if *the lifestyle itself is what interests you*--which, maybe it does, sounds like it might--then by all means, give it a try.  you'll rapidly discover for yourself what you'll be signing up for in the process.  

the 90s and 2000s were just like any other time period:  cool and shitty.  the cool stuff makes for good memes and nostalgia culture.  the shitty stuff is mostly just written about in boring books.

we live now, in 2025.  we do 2-factor authentication multiple times a day.  the doctor asks you to fill out a form on your phone.  the train costs less if you use the app.  most people text more than they call *or speak to anyone in person*.  we could get luddite about it, but that doesn't serve us.  it's the Current Year.  we have to adapt.

your shitty attention span is a cultural, generational problem.  and i don't mean "oh gen Z! your whole generation is wack!"  i mean cultural and generational in the sense that it's something we're all facing together, en masse.  it's not abitrary--it's not that right now, we had the misfortune of being cast into this time period where Shit Sucks 'Cause The IPhone And Stuff.  every time in history is good and bad.

radio with CD player is a great gadget.  an alarm clock can't hurt.  fun knickknacks and nostalgic fashion and shit, that's all good.  handicapping your life by way of technological self-sabotage in the name of attaining the Pure Simplicity of the Old Days is a misguided fairytale.  anyway , i don't know why i'm wording this so brusquely but i guess i'm just enjoying yelling at this cloud</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I guess that might depend on where you live and what your lifestyle is—I don’t have to 2 factor authenticate things that often, and when I do it’s through sms. My doctor sends me a form to fill out but it’s optional, and not doing it adds literally 30 seconds to my check in time. The train in my city costs the same if you pay by phone or buy a ticket, and I definitely text way less than I talk to people in person. 

And the latter isn’t even any attempt at digital minimalism, I actually like texting—but none of my friends text even a fraction as much as when we were teenagers.  People have real jobs, families, hobbies, errands, and the money to actually go out with friends regularly, and seem to have finally figured out that it’s rude to go out with friends and then text the whole time. </div>

So I'm at a dog park that's one town over (15 min or more away). I get a notification on my security system and open the app - it's a neighbor walking his dog.

As I'm watching the live footage, a 2 door lifted white Chevy Silverado drives by and I take note because I'm not use to seeing it in our little community. 

It had tinted windows and very specific after market, all black rims. I just observe it for a moment, ...</div>

The green arrow didn't come on for 3 cycles, just stayed red the while time while the adjacent lane had a green light. During those 3 cycles of the stop lights I saw the same silver Pontiac Vibe go through, going the same direction, every time. Being this was like 15 years ago the vibe was still a fairly popular automobile. But not in a town of 1500.</div>

[Look at the compute cost here](https://i.imgur.com/qAuZBOY.png), and note that they [don't do this change for the mini model](https://i.imgur.com/G0KprkB.png)

They should really rename it to:  
o3-low  
o3-xlow

90% of people are just using free ChatGPT. The subset of users who are going to care enough to pay and then use the model picker to select o4-mini-high, yeah, they might care, and a lot of them are doing more advanced stuff.

Also, on a percentage scale, as you get closer to 100, 2 points can make a big difference because the error rate is 1 - success rate. So, if you go from 90 to 92% correct... That is a reduction in error rate of 20%.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, agreed. The rate Google is pumping out models at lmarena - nightwhisper, stargazer, dragontail, etc. Google's long context is still unmatched. Veo 2, imagen 3.2, etc., No openai subscription so can't really tell if Gemini 2.5 Pro is quicker than o3 and o4-mini. From what I heard 2.5's reasoning seems to be drastically different from models like R1. So, maybe 2.5 Pro is something special - I don't know. At times, 2.5 Pro does feel more like a base model that plans rather than reasons.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Also, for non-professional uses, Google offers basically unlimited use of Gemini 2.5 in their AI Studio.

I just coded a whole browser game top to bottom with it, though I did use Suno for the soundtrack, SkyboxAI for the background, and ChatGPT image generator for the menus and logo and stuff. The only thing not AI generated in it is about 12 seconds of sound effects which were FOSS sounds from Pixbay.

Gemini blew me away and I was using it pretty intensely for about 4 days and never hit a single limit in my use of it.

Granted, I can’t sell the game (not that it’s even good enough to) since I used the free AI Studio, but Google let me build a project for free that would have probably cost me like $60 if I’d used OpenAI’s models.

Also, I can’t go into details, but Google is working really hard on their dataset and of things.</div>

The gel packs I’ve used (and maybe I’m not getting the right ones) don’t completely conform to my knee so there’s not as much cold transfer. I’ve used bags with ice in the past- damn cold and it wraps around the knee, but it’s a pain and uses up ice that I want for my drinks. This seems to work better.</div>

The melting point is higher based on the ratios. 

Ice pack melts at 0c over the cource of an hour. 

A Salt based PCM can be mixed to melt at 15c over a course of 4 hours and you don't have to worry about freeze damaging tissue.

There was something about RuneScape that made it so addicting and immersive that no other game came close. The world felt so alive and vibrant. It had a lot of nice soundtracks, too. </div>

We are sentient, but that doesnt have to mean we are in control. We could be just watching our bodies and brains function and we assume we are calling the shots.

But idk, thats just a theory.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I often think about who would be on my Mount Rushmore of UFOlogy. He's about the only guy who instantly gets a spot without question.

Edit: Just for fun, the others would be:
  
Stanton Friedan - Aside from being such an ardent researcher in the field, he's the guy who informed the public on the Roswell incident &amp; ultimately brought it into pop culture. Now it's synonymous with UFO lore. 

Bob Lazar - Whether you believe him or not, his story made Area 51 public. Area 51 is as synonymous with UFOlogy as Roswell is. (I realize the contradictory irony of putting Lazar on a list with Friedman - but they both brought these things into pop culture &amp; thus into public awareness.)

John Mack - He is probably the biggest *hero* of them all. In a time when this topic was heavily ridiculed and mocked, in steps a tenured professor at Harvard University who *listened* to experiencers. He didn't judge them, he didn't try to diagnose them, he didn't lead them to a preconceived conclusion. When his career was threatened, he didn't back away. He went against the establishment when he really didn't have to. I hate repeating memes, but he was the hero a lot of people needed.</div>

Throughout my entire life, whenever I've been excited for the right person to get dragged up under oath to testify about something important, it's the same shit - "I don't recall". And even if they are caught lying, nobody goes down for perjury.
