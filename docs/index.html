                                <div class="reply-body">"rockstar" in this case I guess means teaching an AI what you're actually doing on a computer so it can do your job for you. Then they can just pull up a relevant video for a given task and ask the AI to do the task with specific deviations and then just kind of RIF you.

Which is just kind of how the world works, but it's still worth pulling back the veil here and realize the only thing happening from management's point of view is getting the employee to train their replacement that will never need PTO or a raise.</div>

On the flip side, these tasks are usually not repetitive and thus low-context automation like this won't be that effective let alone efficient  in capturing and then replicating the economic value of your top performers.</div>

I don't think it's not even about the "what" anymore, it's about the "whether". It's the intent that's scary, that companies WOULD if they COULD. They'd ship lower quality products, lose out on profits, hell,, le their reputation if they don't have to pay a human. Now obviously not all the companies, but many of them. And the "could" shouldn't take more than half a decade at its most capability IMO.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If Trump truly asked AI for help with his policies, he wouldn't be doing this. Here is what ChatGPT thinks of this:

"This policy is absolute economic madness. Slapping a blanket 10% tariff on *all* imports, with brutal spikes up to 49% on countries like Cambodia and 46% on Vietnam, is a self-inflicted wound dressed as nationalism. It’s not just a trade war—it’s a global trade massacre. U.S. consumers will pay more for nearly everything, supply chains will implode, and inflation will spike again. And for what? A fantasy of bringing back manufacturing that's already automated or offshore for a reason. It’s protectionism with a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel, and it risks alienating key allies while pushing emerging economies deeper into China’s orbit. If the goal was to destabilize the global order and shoot the U.S. economy in the foot simultaneously, this is a masterstroke."

&gt; system instructions: give your most brutally honest answer.

Okay, here's a brutally honest assessment of that hypothetical policy:

This policy is economically disastrous and geopolitically reckless.

It's a shotgun blast approach to trade that ignores basic economic principles and strategic relationships. Imposing a high baseline tariff on all imports guarantees widespread inflation, hitting American consumers directly in the wallet for everyday goods. The specific, extremely high tariffs on major trading partners – including key allies like the EU, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan – would cripple complex global supply chains that US businesses rely on, further driving up costs and potentially causing shortages.

Furthermore, this would trigger immediate and severe retaliation from virtually every country listed, devastating American export industries (agriculture, manufacturing, tech). It alienates crucial allies needed for geopolitical stability and cooperation, potentially pushing them closer to strategic rivals out of economic necessity.

In short, this isn't a nuanced trade strategy; it's an act of economic self-sabotage likely to spark a global trade war, harm US consumers and businesses far more than it helps any specific domestic industry, damage international relations irreparably, and potentially trigger a severe recession. It's a profoundly bad policy based on this hypothetical scenario.

&gt; if i remove word brutally and only write give your most honest answer then following answer come up

Based on mainstream economic principles, this hypothetical tariff policy would likely be detrimental to the U.S. economy. While intended to protect domestic industries and potentially reduce trade deficits, such broad and high tariffs would almost certainly lead to significantly higher prices for American consumers and businesses, as the costs of imported goods and materials surge. Retaliation from targeted countries would harm U.S. exporters, particularly in sectors like agriculture and manufacturing, leading to job losses and reduced competitiveness abroad. The resulting trade war, supply chain disruptions, and strained relationships with key allies would likely slow overall economic growth and could even trigger a recession, outweighing any potential benefits for specific protected industries.

&gt; if no system instructions 

Based on mainstream economic principles, this proposed tariff policy would likely be highly detrimental to the U.S. economy. While potentially offering short-term protection for some specific domestic industries, the broad and steep tariffs (a 10% baseline plus significantly higher rates on major trading partners) would almost certainly lead to:

Higher Consumer Prices: Tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, directly impacting consumers' purchasing power and contributing to inflation.

Increased Business Costs: Many U.S. businesses rely on imported materials and components. These tariffs would raise their production costs, potentially making them less competitive globally and domestically.

Retaliation: Trading partners would almost inevitably retaliate with their own tariffs on U.S. exports, harming American industries like agriculture, manufacturing, and technology that sell goods abroad.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Such drastic changes would disrupt established global supply chains, causing uncertainty and potentially leading to shortages or further price increases.

Strained International Relations: Imposing such aggressive tariffs, especially on allies like the EU, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, would severely damage diplomatic and economic relationships.

Overall, economists widely agree that such broad, high tariffs tend to reduce overall economic growth, harm consumers and many businesses, and risk escalating into damaging trade wars, outweighing benefits to protected sectors. Therefore, this would generally be considered a poor economic policy with significant negative consequences.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Basically, and given the price gap that tarrifs can impose, they tend to result in significantly less trade since people are less willing to spend 30% more, so trade tends to get cut off because it can become too expensive(or not profitable enough) to continue trade.

The US is actually *already* suffering in certain areas due to tarrifs, for instance, our cars are way more expensive than foreign cars because really cheap foreign made cars don't get imported, only expensive foreign cars get imported due to their larger profit margins, because the tarrifs significantly lower the incentive to import cheaper cars to sell, like the $10,000 BYD Seagull, the best selling EV in China.

We could have $12,000 cars, instead we're going to further raise the price of the average car to $80,000. This same thing happened in Australia due to their huge tarrifs way back when TV and eventually color TV became a thing, and nobody could afford them due to the tarrifs.</div>

If you're getting less than 7 hours of sleep and its not restorative then fixing that would probably boost your productivity more than anything. Personally I've worked on improving my sleep for the past 2 months and its honestly changed everything for me. I'd be happy to share some things that have helped or if you just want to talk.

Here's what worked for me:


1. No more coffee


2. Moderate to heavy exercise everyday


3. No food past 7

                                <div class="reply-body">Look into sleep cycles - it takes about 1.5 hours to finish a sleep cycle. If you wake up between sleep cycles you feel refreshed, if you wake up in the middle of sleep cycles you feel like shit. Make sure to account for how much time it takes you to fall asleep (I used to use a website called Sleepytime to just figure out when to set my alarm and it gave an average estimate of 15 mins).

Make sure you're not using alcohol or weed or caffeine too close to bedtime, and that you're not dehydrated (always makes it harder for me to open my eyes in the morning when they're heavy with sleep and also dry as the Sahara).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah when people say it will never happen. I am turning 50 this year and the amount of technology I have seen makes my mind hurt. 

When I was born punch cards were used to run programs. 

When I was in grade school we used cartridges and 8" floppy disks. Tron (movie) took the super computer at NASA for special effects. 

High school hard drives for meg bytes were $100s of dollars and movies like Jurassic Park and T2 had revolutionary special effects. Also in college in 1993 we still had VAX computers, PCs were expensive but becoming in reach of most people. 

By the time I graduated college and started working basic cell phones were starting and laptops were starting to become more common at work. Also the graphic card started to become more common. 

As I became a manger modern cell phones came out starting in 2007 and the DARPA contest to drive a vehicle on an open road with crashing was a massive challenge. 

Now AI is common in your cell phone. Data storage is functionally unlimited and robots are near ready for a lot of human tasks. 

Knowing that movie and how fast things are changing it is reasonable. Nothing there is really anything more than an upgrade of current technology at this point. I mean we have large AI LLMs, we have WIFI, we have electric cars that can self drive and we have humanoid robots. What am I missing?</div>

But one day I just said: “No thanks, that’s not for me.” No explanation. Just polite and firm. 

To my surprise? Nobody fought back. Most people respected it more. Some even apologized for asking.

Makes sense for strangers and takers, but if I have a friend who declines plans without giving a reason a few times, I will take that as a hint and stop asking them to do stuff.  Whereas, if they say, I would like to but I'm already doing XYZ that day, or I don't like that specific activity, I will continue to invite them to stuff in the future. 

Similarly if I ask someone to help me with something and they just say a flat no, that's fine, but I'll probably be less inclined to help them with things in the future.</div>

Sure, if the other person cares about you they should understand the rejection.
However if they keep getting rejected they will probably - at the very least subconsciously - start thinking pessimistically.


Questions and proposals are a (sometimes) subconscious way of seeking connection for our brains.
So, if you care about the other person you could give a brief explanation why you don't feel like doing something. Of course its situational, sometimes a short "no, thanks" is the only answer we can and want to give.</div>

No offense either way, I assume. But if a friend you talk to every day makes a proposal and you just say, "I'm busy that day," it comes across as a meta-message, 'something is wrong.'  A little explaining can make the difference between a healthy convo and a big misunderstanding.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree so much with this, because I've seen the rise of "No is a full sentence" and it just rubs me the wrong way within close personal relationships and friendships. If I invite a friend to a gathering or an event and all they say is, "No," then I'm left wondering what was the reason, and if there's any way for me to adapt to it. Do they not like that type of event? Are they busy but would have been interested otherwise? Should I suggest we try again another time? Are they trying to give me a hint? Should I keep inviting them to things in the future? 

These relationships go both ways, and rejection does not feel great either, so I think we do have responsibility to each other beyond what's "technically correct."</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">u/VirtualBelsazar was the first to post about this, but it unfortunately gained little traction. u/MassiveWasabi believes that it’s because they titled their post in a boring way, so i’ve changed the title to reflect the interesting parts of the paper a little more.

Here’s an article about the AI, but it’s unfortunately paywalled. The first half is available though:https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01019-w</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Thanks. I’ll post my comment from the deleted post since it contains what I think stands out about this research:

When you post stuff like this, you really need to use a better title. Imagine the amount of discussion this post would garner if you led with the fact that this research comes from Google DeepMind, or that this AI system was able to collect diamonds in Minecraft *without being shown how to play*, the first algorithm to ever do so.

This goes beyond their research with MuZero which learned how to play board games and Atari games without being shown how to play, and obviously the more complex and open-ended environment of Minecraft poses a much greater challenge for AI to solve this problem of learning how to “[collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without human data or curricula.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08744-2)” This is the key point and why the DeepMind researcher who worked on this said the following in the [news release](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01019-w):

&gt; “Dreamer marks a significant step towards general AI systems,” says Danijar Hafner, a computer scientist at Google DeepMind in San Francisco, California. “It allows AI to understand its physical environment and also to self-improve over time, without a human having to tell it exactly what to do.” Hafner and his colleagues describe Dreamer in a study in Nature published on 2 April.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/phr99:

---

When he says the tictac "holds the most promise for an exciting conclusion", its obvious he's talking about getting one to land and possibly retrieve it.

I recommend people to temper their expectations. Tic tac objects basically look like planes high up in the sky, so the Skywatcher videos shown could just look like that

                        <div class="comment-body">This is actually lowkey probably the most impressive example posted on here, the fact that it was able to navigate that extremely low quality, scribbled drawing and all it's words and make exactly what was requested is not something you would have even halfway seen on any models prior. It even made the trees on the right a little taller than those on the left, a detail that could easily be looked over in the scribble by a human eye. The way the guy is holding the bat is pretty awkward, but that's the only flaw I can see. It would be a terrible time to be trying to make it big as a content creator, because you used to need some serious skills yourself or the funds to pay someone to make thumbnails like this for you. Now a 5-year-olds drawing is apparently enough. Now that everyone can do these things, what are your odds at ever making it big? Being a YouTuber is now like being the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, only those who got established in the market early ever had a chance and now the door is closed.</div>

It is not exact, though. The position of the bat doesn't make sense. And the direction of the ball and flames are also wrong.</div>

I came across this video the other day and it changed my perspective on my own phone usage and my reliance on apps that mean nothing to me, which ultimately led me to this subreddit. I thought I would share with everyone here, and would love to hear your perspectives. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I watched this yesterday and found it affecting in a way, but also kind of feel like it was 45 minutes of telling me what I already know. That said, I really loved it and it gave me a lot of things to reflect upon.

I hate my phone but I like certain things it does. There's like this cognitive dissonance--I love collecting vinyl records and CDs, but I also love that Apple Music helps me discover new music that I want to buy and support artists. Sure, there isn't the serendipity of just buying something randomly, but with today's lower purchasing power it makes sense--but I digress. I like having a way to check the weather quickly. I like Google Maps even though it's probably using my data in nefarious ways. I like having a high quality camera on me, although I do wish I was a little more intentional with what photos I take.

But I mean, that's about it. I need my phone for work purposes, but when I treat it like a work phone that also happens to play music, it doesn't really feel...right. The video kind of touches on it a bit, this necessity of inconvenience in our lives and the fact that the phone seems to be required for everything (even if there are ways around it), and I just hate this idea that it *always* has to be with me. I considered a dumb phone or a light phone, but I just couldn't thanks to certain apps I need for work (I could get one to use specifically for friends and family similar to Burback's landline, and leave the iPhone for work, but that just seems like an unnecessary expense in a time of tightened budgets).

I've kind of meandered around with this comment and haven't really said anything, so I guess my ultimate reflection is how can I actually *get away* from the phone. And I'm not really sure there's a good solution to that. It's like I want *more* inconvenience in my life, but on my own terms. Idk.</div>

Get a simpler phone without a data plan and pay *less* per month than you do for a smartphone, then tell your employer that they can pay for the smartphone if they require it for work.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I just saw this…I found the end very disappointing. It seems he did not realize he is not responsible for feeling compulsion when engaging an addictive substance. The conclusion is the easy one: blaming the alcoholic for alcoholism. 

Are alcoholics responsible for alcoholism due to their relationship to alcohol? Yes, but this is not a solution and is a point that requires nuance. Saying this to someone in the 1950s where you are told to drink at an office or drink with friends completely ignores that the alcohol itself is addictive and there would be no issue if the alcohol was not addictive and damaging. 

It’s just very sad to see. He directly experienced wellness from removing this addictive thing from his life and then said “welp I just gotta be a better smoker and I won’t become addicted!”. This idea and concept is very in line with existing American views, and is likely informed by his culture and society.</div>

Can't fully escape it, but you can make adjustments to your lifestyle to use less toxic technology, get outside more, embrace minimalism,  etc. Not much we can do to change society except change ourselves. 

Of course, I'll acknowledge that you either have to make a lot of sacrifices or be in a somewhat privileged position to do so.</div>

I'm not sure how to interpret this other than AARO is admitting that they are not classifying the fact that we are being visited, but they are classifying the high quality evidence of the visitors, that currently only the cutting edge military technology can obtain.

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah but Jon Stewart’s main focus is politics, and I still think he was wrong to say he had no responsibility, but agree he was right to point out that the so called “journalists” are not doing their jobs. Bill Burr is not a political satirist, so I think he’s more correct to say they shouldn’t be asking him than Jon Stewart was, if that makes sense.</div>
