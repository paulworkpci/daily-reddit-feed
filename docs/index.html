                        <div class="comment-body">I totally get this! I go to uni and the hour commute there and back is so draining. By the time I come home I need an hour or two of doing nothing before feeling rested enough to do other things! 

Honestly I’ve found that there are ways to make things funner/ less draining. For instance, I find it hard to do a lot of things (autism and adhd) so I tend to put on music and/ or one of my comfort shows on in the background to help. You could possibly do this while driving. I watch Bob’s Burgers and Arrested Development. So possibly that could help. If you have 4G/ some form of wifi, you could also download/ listen to things in the car as well. Like documentaries about things you’re interested in, podcasts, or YouTube videos you’ve been meaning to watch but haven’t gotten around to. If you like singing or music, you could practice singing in the car. 

I also get being too tired to focus on learning things/ creativity after you’ve been to work. I would say use the Pomodoro technique (20 min timers) and just start. Be creative/ learn for an hour on weekdays/ after you’ve been to work and then do more on weekends. Perhaps in the mornings you could also try this, if you feel especially fresh, and adjust your sleeping habits accordingly. Even just an hour (or even 20 mins!) of studying a day can improve things! 

You could also see if there are any ways to make yourself less drained after work. For me, I play video games for an hour or two. Meditation or exercise could work as well.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It sounds like you’ve got a lot going on already, and it's great that you're prioritizing exercise and healthy habits! Mental fatigue can definitely be a challenge with a busy schedule. One thing you might want to experiment with is shifting your study time to a time when you're naturally more alert, like right after your commute or after a light snack, to give your brain a quick boost. Also, trying out techniques like the Pomodoro method (25-minute focused study sessions followed by short breaks) could help make the most of your limited focus time. Another thought is to adjust your sleep schedule slightly—maybe by winding down a bit earlier to get a bit more rest before waking up. Lastly, try to break down your goals into smaller, digestible chunks so it feels less overwhelming. Small, consistent steps can really add up over time!</div>

The circular, metal object crashed near a village and a deafening bang was heard before it did. I don't know if it's part of a plane. Can anyone identifying it? It was posted on Facebook by some of the locals who were on scene.

                        <div class="comment-body">i guess this is a sad personal anecdote, but my wife used to make fun of me a lot for getting stoned and watching Ancient Aliens, even though i'd be cool with her getting wine tipsy and watching Real Housewives of Whatever

my MIL was staying with us when that 60 Minutes aired, and 60 Minutes is one of "her programs" 

after the 60 Minutes aired, i remember doing having a solid 5 minutes of joy doing the "Not saying I told you so, but I told you so..." victory dance

In my experience, the service is always good, too, but not in that annoying too-friendly I-want-a-big-tip way, but rather they know half their customers are on a tight schedule so there's no dicking around.  Get the order, serve the drinks, get the food out, give the bill. Bam bam bam bam.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Man, really watch that food there. I initially grabbed a chicken wrap a few weeks ago at one since I was traveling and looked at the sodium content. That shit was like 3000+ mg of salt… for a tortilla, lettuce, maybe some sort of spread and a little bit of chicken.

That meant sprinting through our individual careers to reach a salary and position to be able to have time to dedicate for our kids. My parents had a home and 4 kids by 26 as an electrician and nurse in Ca…that’s not possible now.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">After wage growth hit it's peak with the inflation crisis, everything went downhill. Big business went to war with labor and government took business's side. Then the 80's hit, times were still good but you needed 2 incomes now to sustain the lifestyle one income used to provide. in the 40 years since, the nature of the economy is just increasingly squeezing harder for less blood from the stone. Sure, there are still families with the income to raise a couple kids but nowhere near the economic freedom for most to do so anymore like there was in the past. Shit, a lot of the couples referenced in the shitty meme above couldn't afford surgery for their fur babies now let alone the cost to raise a kid. But 40 years ago, they could in the same jobs they have now. It just is what it is.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">One morning shortly after we got married my wife and i were having some first-thing-in-the-morning-sex and our landline started ringing. We weren't about to stop, especially since 90% of calls we got were telemarketers or people calling for the previous owner of our phone line. Well, our answering machine kicked in and we heard my mother-in-law'a voice informing us that my wife's grandfather had passed away overnight. Nothing quite kills a boner like hearing a family member just passed away.</div>

Keep in mind he’s been basically dictating Trumps policy. Trump said he was going to get rid of H1B visas in 2016/2020. Elon tweets. Trump supports H1B visa. Trump supports the bipartisan budget bill Mike Johnson proposed. Elon tweets. Trump rescinds his support of the bill.

Our real president is a ketamine addict.</div>

My head canon is based off a distant memory of a 30 rock episode where they talk about memory and scent being linked, so I’ve associated studying with a specific room spray I have to signal my brain it’s time to focus.

If you care about things, if you're enthusiastic, if you have keen interests or you express yourself enthusiastically about something, especially something unusual, you are cringe, you're doing too much, you're tweaking, you're yapping, 'the world keeps spinning', and it's not that deep bro. 

This corrosive attitude became really apparent to me a few years ago when the nerd emoji started...</div>

It always struck me as strange to put people down as 'doing too much' or 'trying too hard'. But really it is just the beginnings of the crabs in a bucket mentality that pervades many societies.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">"I find myself sometimes hesitant to really be enthusiastic about something, or at least to talk enthusiastically to others about it."

As a lifelong super nerd, it's taken me 6 decades to figure this out. When we nerds talk about our interests in detail, the non-nerds sometimes feel self-conscious about their own intelligence or education. They are aware there is a gap, just like I am aware when the computer nerds talk that they know much, much more than I do.  The difference is  that I understand when you are in your happy spot because there are topics that fascinate me as well.    Normal/regular people  don't get extreme dopamine spikes from knowledge. In fact, some of them feel self-conscious, dumb, maybe ashamed even when they interact with someone that knows more about a topic and wants to talk about.  Then they get mad as if it's your fault they feel bad. 

It doesn't make me afraid to have any quirky hobbies, it means I don't talk about them to people.  The joke is on them because I've made a lot of money off of my quirky interests. I take my quirks to the bank.</div>

You guys have it easier to find the job you like and generally be happier! As a kid I wished I was one of the nerds because they're unique and they genuiely enjoy stuff other people don't enjoy.

If you believe this shit I got a bridge to sell you.

Even the site you're on now used bots/fake profiles/fake users to simulate users engaging in the system which creates a network effect attracting more users.

FB is or will have unlisted user accounts that manipulate social sentiment. It is *way* too powerful and profitable for companies not to do so.</div>

There is an agenda, publicly stated by Sam Altman in an interview and implied by other tech bros, to make people view LLMs as human as possible. That relationship brings more money than seeing them as tools and machines.</div>

With that in mind, why wouldn't they still be fucking losers if they were already fucking losers? Their success hasn't come from any place that would change them because it's just a wind buffeting them along.</div>

He was a friendless 20-something loser who gamed 24/7 and he created burner accounts (on twitter coincidentally) to encense himself.   He actually used me and my own son identity.

It was one of the saddest thing I saw but kinda expected from a dude like this.   

It really depressed me that the richest man and one of the most influential person earth is behaving like this.  

When he tells you he works himself to death, take it with a grain of salt.</div>

There's a couple things that really made my life way easier because it allowed me to still use a computer without requiring the internet.  It was kiwix and the debian repo.  With kiwix I could have a copy of wikipedia.  It was really nice back during covid too because it was all pre-covid.  The debian repo was really nice because I still had a "app store" on my computer, and could do things like type something up or rip a DVD or play a small game if I wanted to.

The other thing I might add is the local LLM's and a garmin.  You get an AI but it's all local.  The garmin is great because you can still get around town without having to connect to anything.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Plus it would be a waste of mass-to-surface-area.

Edit: Not sure why I was downvoted. A solidish spheroid  like Earth has much more mass than a large relatively thin panel array of the same surface area would. If the ASI wanted to still have organic life live (sustainably), then something like a few dozen [McKendree Cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKendree_cylinder) could house the current human population and probably would be in such an entities capabilities by just mining large asteroids. Why would this entity think of building on rocky planets/planetoids when other geometries are more efficient from an energy-capture perspective?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Earth, as the only available habitable planet, is incredibly precious.  
Even if AI cares only about electricity and silicone, I trust that it will see the bigger picture and have this understanding. Bigger picture, as in universal scale big.  
At least until the wild technological advencement, many of us here fantasize about, where the ASI moves up on the Kardashev scale to type 3 and beyond.

This is also why Im optimistic that a superinteligent AI will see the value in us humans, as the only known intelligent organic species in the universe. Animal intelligence is also interesting, but we are more complex. It would be nice, if the AI god made a planet sized ZOO/reservation of Earth.</div>

Every o series researcher from OAI seem to be saying the same thing. They have been talking about saturating all benchmarks from around mid november iirc and then they show us o3 by mid december. I think there is a high chance this is it.
Check out Noam Browns interview the day previous to o1 release, they had the first sparks of what the o models would become by around Oct 2023. Isnt that close to the date Sama said "saw the veil of knowldage move forward" or something like that.

Some time in 2025 well have such a model. O3 is more capable than the majority of humans in these domains and in touching distance of the best humans. 


Other domains don't really matter as much, it's super human Maths and Science that will cause the technological singularity not superhuman poetry skills. </div>

&gt;Ilya founded SSI with the plan to do a straight shot to Artificial Super Intelligence. No intermediate products, no intermediate model releases.

&gt;Many people (me included) saw this as unlikely to work since if you get the flywheel spinning on models / products, you can build a real moat. 

&gt;However, the success of scaling test time compute (which Ilya likely saw early signs of) is a good indication that this direct path to just continuing to scale up might actually work.

&gt;We are still going to get AGI, but unlike the consensus from 4 years ago that it would be this inflection point moment in history, it’s likely going to just look a lot like a product release, with many iterations and similar options in the market within a short period of time (which fwiw is likely the best outcome for humanity, so personally happy about this).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is what Dr Ben Goertzel predicted in his Ted Talk a few years ago. Basically once we achieve AGI, ASI will follow extremely shortly afterwards as it’s exponential. 

The only problem is we’re seeing a closed source centralized organization determining this and not using a globally decentralized and transparency approach with open-source. 

I’m guessing nations that put an emphasis on surveillance and military may not be the best suited as a path forward for potentially the next intelligent species on earth.</div>
