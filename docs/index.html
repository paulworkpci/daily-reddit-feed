But the problem is that they have gone up in price so much over the past few years they're just not worth it anymore. The lowest trim you can buy today is a Premium that starts at $37k. Just a few years ago you could get a Premium for $32k and a base model for $30k-ish. They're good cars, but they're not good cars at those prices.</div>

As an owner of one of these, it has the perfect power + gear ratios to be a zippy daily on the street without going to jail. If you want to be a boy racer, the FA24 has been very friendly to tunes.

The stock power band is also MUCH more usable than any previous generation wrx. Way less rev hang and more low-end torque</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The fact that new WRX makes about 35hp MORE on a dyno than the previous generation, yet they advertise it as only 3hp more raises questions.   Also,  its running around at 6psi less boost than the VA even though it's by far the strongest, most reliable engine ever put in a WRX.

This thing was massively nerfed.   But why?   I lean towards majority-owner Toyota not wanting the GR Corolla to look bad.   Would also explain the killing of the STI.</div>

He makes money from perpetual hype that people like OP buy into. He isn't reliable in the slightest.

People just act like this clown didn't claim we had AGI damn near 3 years ago. As if that wasn't  retarded enough, he went further and said by the time he made that tweet, AGI was already old news and that we already had MUCH BETTER MODELS behind closed doors, with open beta testing to start in 2023!!

Also lied about almost everything regarding gpt5 at the time, was wrong about gpt 4.5 and it's release, wrong about anthropic an supposed anthropic release around the same date (December if I'm not mistaken), multimodal gpt 5 with 125 TRILLION parameters finishing training in 2022 and to be released mid 2024, autonomous agents in 2024, missed damn near everything about "searchGPT"

But he gets some dates right, so it evens out</div>

                <div class="post-content">Why do chatgpt and other AI tools still suck when it comes to UI generation? The design it outputs seems too low effort, amateur and plain wrong.

How do you solve this and what tools sre you using? I am aware of v0, but while bit better it still always outputs copy paste shadcn style design.

Then I ask it to list the entire design as acceptance criterias, I then open a new chat and ask for code in, say, angular and giving it the acceptence criterias as the condition of success. 

I dont have very good experience with letting LLMs illustrate concrete things.</div>

                <div class="post-content">*after typing all this out, I came back to the top to note this, it actually made me sad writing this. I didn’t realize how much I missed and was genuinely excited in past Games vs this current form. Maybe it’s nostalgia, but damn the Golden age of the CF Games was special. 

I watched the entire weekend. Have been to Carson and Madison in the past. Here’s some observations based on this weekend and how it appears in its current form. 

1) The Games is literally a shell of what it once was. Part...</div>

Dave Castro has always been a smug and abrasive asshole but after you actually kill one of your athletes and continue to be a smug and abrasive asshole within days of the incident…yeah, I’m out.

                                <div class="reply-body">CrossFit will never move forward until we see Castro move on. From a leadership perspective, CrossFit is stuck in 2000 until we see all the old rot get pulled out. Castro has never said sorry in his life and never will. Combine that with the fact that he runs his own independent social media platform essentially and you will always have a company at odds with itself. 

The methodology and the sport did what everyone wanted them to do: reached a very wide audience. When the audience became more inclusive, the “OG” folks bristled and dug into a vision of the past that doesn’t exist anymore. Making fun of black people dying, gross anti-feminism stuff, and now harming athletes through neglect. 

The average person is well aware that HQ killed a man through penny pinching then paid Casto’s buddy to write a report that said nothing was done wrong.</div>

Leaving the door open makes it easy for them to gain taht access and be confident you won't mind them poking in. Making the bed shows respect.

**edit to add**: making the bed relates to the days where you're still a guest in the house. as commenters noted below, if it's the day you're leaving, do the host a favor and strip your bed of the sheets for easy washing!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It is impressive. 

For the uneducated, my understanding is as follows:

It is part of the way models are trained to understand the world around us. When training visual models they essentially train the ability to form images from visual noise. Training is completed in phases first the model learns how to reduce 1% noise, then 10%, later 50% noise, finally it gets to the point we are at now. The ability to generate 100% new data from pointless noise. Each time it’s essentially getting better at generating images from less and less data. Tie in the insanely large visual data set with objects and location trading in place, and you suddenly can NCIS enhance photos of real places from very fuzzy data pools.  Even understanding the mechanics behind it, seeing the routines come together to produce the clean restorative work is really really impressive.</div>
