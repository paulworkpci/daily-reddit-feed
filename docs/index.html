                                <div class="reply-body">Ferguson is bad historian.

He's known to often fall for ultracrepidarianism (go out of his field of expertise and pretend to be an expert only to utterly fail in his analyses, check his (way too long) Wikipedia page).

Here he displays a mechanistic, too simplistic depiction of reality. It's a cartoonish depiction of demographics from the Middle Ages; since the green revolution and progresses in industry and agriculture, human population aren't ruled by mere production forces laws.

There are whole fields of economics which are purely based on leisure, cultural and superfluous sectors of the economy (ie not only predicated on the pure simplest survival of the species, feeding people). It has been the case since the fricking Neolithic and the invention of sedentary agriculture, smh...

Even for horses, his analysis is not accurate and only a fake common wisdom:

[https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/features/from-the-stone-age-to-now-how-horsepower-changed-our-world](https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/features/from-the-stone-age-to-now-how-horsepower-changed-our-world)

Horse population began climbing up again, as if they weren't used only for transportation and basic mechanistic reasons... And humans are much more diverse and useful.

It seems as if Ferguson made himself redundant as a historian by making empty fake common wisdom claims.

Though i'm glad that even a bad historian like Ferguson now recognizes how much of a crank Yudkowsky is.

Humans aren't actors in the market just for "thinking". This is a profound misunderstanding of how humans and the market work.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Like when are we getting the next gpt3.5/4o/o1 moment?, reasoning models kinda feel boring they are good but still dumb,they are still not 'actually' replacing much jobs
Even robotics hasn't actually done anything useful, chinese robots are definitely showing really cool tricks but they are not actually being used in factories
Has their been any new breakthrough in llm research that's actually in testing to get great models</div>

Anthropic already showed that models reason beyond what they output as tokens. Extended thinking in latent space could be another vector for scaling.</div>

 Tt wasn't a breakthrough if you ask me, just a welcome improvement over non thinking models, just look at benchmark or the response it gaves you. What was really a breakthrough was the transformers architecture. Since then it has been just incremental improvements.</div>

Not only would there be a danger of extra administrative work but a lot of times taking on these responsibilities as a woman is seen as being less capable and thus being judged as less promotion worthy. Especially in tech or engineering. The articles about this phenomenon call this type of work "glue work". While glue work might be seen as impressive and taking leadership and responsibility as a man, it is not likely to be seen the same way when a woman does it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Great point. i can see it becoming very easy to move from being a facilitator for collaboration to simply someone taking dictation from higher ups who don't have a budget for administrative staff. When I've seen this happen, it's invariably a woman. 

Definitely one of those things that, as a man,  I don't think about as actively as I should, but as soon as someone says it you think "oh man, that does happen a lot".</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is a hugely important distinction. I used to drive almost all meetings and leaders would view it as an admin task - essentially taking notes for the "more important people" who participated (even though I'm a lawyer did a lot of heavy lifting in those meetings.) And when you volunteer to do this, it often ends with additional work of cleaning up the final notes and following up with the team post-meeting, which in some contexts can become more unrecognized admin work. Be very strategic about this.</div>

Lately I have been integrating AI services into my workflow and I agree with you. AI can be a good coder, but it can hardly have an overview of the system. Surely in the future that won't be a problem, but right now it is.

Out of curiosity, what stack do you use to build your games?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">My initial letterlinks game with claude code was built in vanilla JS... Because the game sort of evolved organically and I was so new to the tool, I didn't really think to stop and ask it to refactor every so often, so I ended up with a couple of absolutely massive files that even Claude itself began to struggle with.

Gridagram uses react and typescript. I also made sure to learn from my previous mistake, and every time I hit a progress point that I was happy with, I asked Gemini to pause and consider opportunities for refactoring/streamlining the codebase.

I'm not a coder so I can't really say for sure how much cleaner the codebase is, but it seems a lot more modular. I also just asked Gemini for refactoring opportunities (it's been a while), and here's a tldr of what it came back with (the full post wouldn't fit in the comment):

Good:

* Code is split into components (LetterGrid, WordList, etc.).

* Complex logic is nicely separated into custom Hooks (useGameState, useLetterSelection).

* Using TypeScript and CSS Modules is good practice.

Needs Improvement / Refactoring Ideas:

* App.tsx is quite large and passes many props down to other components (prop drilling).

* State isn't truly centralized, making it harder to manage as the app grows.

* Tutorial logic is mixed directly into App.tsx, making it complex.

TLDR Suggestion:Consider using React Context (or a lightweight state library like Zustand) to manage the main game state. This would simplify App.tsx and make state easier to access everywhere without passing props down multiple levels.</div>
