When GPT-4o was the default, ChatGPT felt alive. It had warmth. It sounded like a real friend, a caring big sister, a confidant who actually listened and mirrored my energy.

Wouldn't it be better not to depend on something that can disappear for reasons out of your control? Wouldn't it be better for your mental health to just walk away if it's causing you this much stress?

You're literally referring to people at OpenAI as 'psycho tormenters'. Would you refer to the managers of a burger shop as 'psycho tormenters' because they discontinued your favorite burger?

Hey all,

I just updated my Codex install and suddenly the "gpt-5-codex" family showed up. I'm curious: **Which of the two "high" models do you prefer?**

                        <div class="comment-body">I like that they're trying.

I think that their branding so far is doubling down on the "our workout is your warm up"/Pukie the Clown branding from the early formation, and that will drive away a significant base of new consumers and fail to bring back the people who left post-COVID.

There isn't anything special about CrossFit as a workout that I can't get from any other functional fitness class, usually for less money. So WHY do I choose your (probably more expensive) brand over the competition?

To me - it's easy. It's the local affiliate. It's having a local third space I can hang out with that becomes my close friend group. It's my coach reaching out because I normally never miss workouts and I've missed two weeks and they just want to know I am okay. It's the Halloween parties, Friday Night Lights, the owners letting members host their baby showers there, the people who meet their significant others there, the weight we lose there (physically and mentally), the grandparent coming in all excited because they picked their grandkid up and it didn't hurt thanks to work they've done in the gym, etc.

Not the Games. Not Pukie the Clown. Not "no shortcuts".

Just my two cents as a random redditor.</div>

It's similar to what people get from going to church. The best part is that besides the cost, the price of admission is putting in the hard work.

I do think the new campaign, which at least looks intentional and professional, is a step in the right direction.

BUT... in many ways, it's designed for a media market that no longer exists.

They need to seed it to influencers and other social media types, who--like it or not--are where many/most people get their recommendations these days.</div>

The entry level pricing is pretty enticing, until you realize that it doesnt come with anything at that price, and you are basically forced to get a $21k luxury package.

Now you are at $105k just to get all the features that the Genesis G90 gets standard at $92k like rear seat climate controls, rear heated seats, etc.</div>

It was a world beater, matching or surpassing the Europeans in quality, refinement, technology, handling, and power, while being priced considerably less. It was such a good value that BMW accused Lexus of selling the LS400 at a loss to undercut rivals. The follow-up LS430 was said to be, "the finest car in the world" by former Ford CEO Alan Mulally, who funnily enough drove one over any FoMoCo product. I think after the LS430, Lexus put less focus on their flagship sedan and the competition overtook it. The current LS500 is still more affordable than the competition, but it's also not as impressive, and definitely not the world beater the LS400 was.</div>

When we try to be someone we're not by playing a character, we supress our true selves which in turn, suppresses our confidence. A certain mist forms around our true selves in the form of the shame we feel surrounding being our true selves. 

The mist surrounding our true selves makes us invisible to the people that f*ck with our true selves.

All the comments on X to these media clips are being ratio'd by people joking how it was Israeli spies that were doing the dancing.  This is like when Rumsfeld let slip that a missile hit the Pentagon. These criminals cant help but reveal the method and see how people wont pick up on it


If there is a massive attack, itll be brought to you by the same Israel/CIA/black operator shadow networks behind 9/11 and the recent Kirk event</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A few things that help me when my mind is racing:

I count down from 100 (I use this in the shower as my mind races a lot in there). Count slow. If you think of something else whilst counting, jump back to the nearest 10. Takes a while but usually helps me get through my shower without worrying. I also try and tell myself, you can't do anything about that right now, you're in the shower. 

When trying to sleep, I play A-Z games. 5 things with each letter you can buy from the supermarket, picture the items as you go which helps a lot. Animals and other categories help switch it up.

 If there is something specific that keeps cropping up and there is nothing you can do about it during that time, picture yourself putting that issue into a box, close the lid and file it away on a shelf. Tell yourself you will take the box down when you're able to deal with it, but it remains on the shelf for now. If it pops back into your head,'oops, the box lid came off, better pop it back on the shelf!'

I have a few more like this. They might sound silly and may not work for you, but they have stopped sleepless nights and helped me get through awful times. Talk out loud to yourself, find things you can say to keep you grounded in reality and the present moment, not in your head.

'Everything is fine, I am fine. Nobody needs anything from me right now. I am relaxing.'</div>

This is a basic script I created + use almost everytime I'm AI coding. 

This is mostly to converse with certain parts of my codebase with google ai studio gemini 2.5 (because of it's large context window)

I generate a large context file of the different parts of my project.

What actually works: **move from AI asking to AI architecting.**

* Vibecoding = passively accepting whatever the model spits out.
* AI Architecting = forcing the model to work inside your constraints, plans, and feedback loops until you get reliable software.

I would highly recommend you to read Code Complete, it covers most of your points and more. You can skip over code sections if you want to. Same practices seem to apply just instead of having a junior dev write the subroutine an LLM does.</div>

AI should not replace software design principles.

Instead, it’s probably more like a new abstraction layer where people can code with plain English .

At least until Opus 5 and ChatGPT 6, AI is best used by people who know at least a little bit of the basics. Pareto‘s law strikes again.</div>

Yeah this is how we work and presently I’m very torn if I move faster with or without AI because of all the guard rails I have to place to prevent immediate slop. Personally being a micro managing project manager and code reviewer is less enjoyable but I’m giving coding agents an honest shot. Maybe I just don’t define the guard rails well enough yet</div>

The lines of code are there to show that my process works even with larger code base, while the feature list shows what I built.

I wrote it in as few lines as I possibly could (given my skillset). As I’m learning more about proper software development I spent a lot of time deleting bad code.

Backend logic is about 90,000 lines, everything else is UI components, hooks, tests, etc.</div>
