I wanted to try Codex CLI, so I bought API credit only to find out, with Tier 1 it's totally unusable.

It's usable with ChatGPT Plus subscription, so I gave it a try.

It was wonderful! Truly joyful vibe coding. Noticeable upgrade from Claude Code (Sonnet 4).

And **it's over** now. **After 2 days** since I activated my subscription.

                        <div class="comment-body">Seems a little fishy to me. I had some days although not recently where I hit the daily limit. At that time it didn’t say when it would reset. I’m in plus btw. 

But, I got a fair amount of usage out of it and it was on medium by default. So I’m not sure how you could have hit the limits so fast. 

Additionally, there was a post the other day that they had increased the limits for plus and other account types I think by 50%. 

I also have a Claude max sub but I’ll probably be doing some work soon in codex and I’ll see how much usage I’m able to get without it cutting me off. </div>

There's no public info about weekly limit, we just know there's some but don't know much about it.

And I was using it on low reasoning effort. Not even that often, I'm not a power user...

                        <div class="comment-body">PRO - It is virtually unlimited. I can sit there pumping out task after task all day long and I usually get one warning I ran out of tasks and it will reset in anywhere from 10-30 minutes.

It is also getting better. The new upgrade yesterday in cloud codex now adds comments on github after the task warning me of issues that will also need to be addressed. I wish it just created the task and fixed that but its very careful about PR.

Claude on the other hand does 30 minutes of coding of Sonnet on the low tier and says, retry in 5 hours after it edits and fixes an error in a file that is just 1000 lines of coding. When I have it code it fixes one thing and breaks another. I go full circle jerk vibe coding and burn up everything.

The solution has been using gpt5 thinking in chat to find the fix and both Grok4 and Opus go - that solution is better than what I came up with.... Grok 4 limits are quite high so I can't wait until they figure out a way to easily export code.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">well yeaaah but... First I wanted to try it and 2 days just isn't enough.

Here me out, this is my experience:

* I bought API credit to test Codex CLI because I've heard good reviews on it
* I hit TPM limit in first or second message with API token because there's Tier 1 with tight limits
* ok, the credit will go to waste if I can't use it, stupid
* 2 days later I cooled off and subscribed to Plus plan to use Codex CLI with it
* I set reasoning effort to low to not overconsume quota
* I hit weekly limit in like 2 days

I'd give PRO a chance but after these many failures? It's hard to justify</div>

But I like your combo. On Claude Code I hit 5 hour window limit but never weekly limit.  
On Codex CLI I never hit 5 hour window limit but only weekly limit.

Those 2 models could work well together.

                        <div class="comment-body">This fucking loser was terminally online and wrote stupid shit all over their guns and mags from** "Get clapped" to "where is your god now?" "6 million wasn't enough" and other cringy shit. This absolute pile of shit got ramped the fuck up from social media until they snapped and killed two kids. 

If you read their "manifesto" they did this because they self diagnosed themselves with lung cancer because they FELT like they had it based on the pains they were getting and they knew those pains meant no return and they didn't want to "rot as a cancer patient" so they did this final act that they had been thinking about for years. Didn't even see a doctor or anything just said, "Yup. Gonna do this" 

Then when the cops show up, ready to take them in they corner themselves and take their own life like the fucking coward that they are. Don't even bury this shitbag in a marked grave and don't show them an ounce of kindness when you speak of them.

To add** For the ones asking "why use they" its fairly simple and definitely wasn't done out of respect. At the time this was posted I didn't know what this piece of shit was and didn't care enough to find out because I'm not wasting time on that and left it at they because I don't give a fuck about the dirtbag.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Neat result, but acing USMLE-style questions isn’t the same as treating a coughing, diabetic 72-year-old who forgot their meds list. Clinics are messy—symptoms conflict, data is missing, risks and side-effects have to be weighed, and someone has to be accountable. If it’s really “better than doctors,” show a live trial where it reduces misdiagnoses, speeds the right treatment, and avoids harm. Until then, it’s a strong copilot for chart summaries, guideline look-ups, and patient letters—humans still make the call.</div>

Also, show me the LLM that can perform a physical exam. If you can't elicit reflexes or palpate an acute abdomen, then there is nothing superhuman about your overall performance in practicing medicine.</div>

"Kill Trump" and his trans footage (old video) will have MAGA ppl thinking "liberal".

Then he mixed in some antisemitism (jew gas), the N word and something about latinos, which will have liberals screaming "Nazi".

Then dude added Russian shit, and Celtic symbolism. The weapons also say "Mashallah" and Breivik, etc🤪.

**It's a clever tactic because most ppl will latch on to the message that suits their world image and blame it on their favorite scapegoat💀☠️.** Dude became the embodiment of Chaotic Evil. Stirring the pot.</div>

It's not some government conspiracy to take away our guns it's sadistic freaks encouraging each other to do acts of violence for laughs. Precisely one of the reasons we need gun control which is why the right pushes these wacko conspiracies about the deep state and cia.


Also don't Google search for o9a because you will probably be flagged. </div>

The only problem with the mustang isn't that it's stagnating, it's that it's stagnating while also going up in price astronomically. Sure inflation etc, but 5 years ago a 60k mustang was a loaded very special edition, now it's a regular GT with leather seats and active exhaust.</div>

The Coyote is a venerated V8 that will go down in history as one of the GOATs. It's literally the last remaining American V8 sports car in production at this point. What more do you have to complain about?

Also on a side note, it's fuckin comical that someone with a K24 Accord and an S2000 is complaining about an engine from 2011 being old...</div>

It's same problem in other kinds of sports car as well. Yea, not so many people want it, so that's reason why we doubt these performance car market because this market is struggling by their fans and buyers.</div>

My grandma didn’t fall for the phone subscriptions, and she’s savvy enough about phone, text and email scams, but she has fallen for a remarkable amount of door to door salesmen and holistic/ homeopathic remedies. Three water filters in the same line because each salesman convinced her that her water quality was bad. Air filters in every room as well as a uv light in the furnace. Magnets under her bed to improve her circulation. Young living essential oils in the kitchen that she was apparently drinking because a rep told her that they were better than the antibiotics she had been prescribed.

All of these have reoccurring monthly payments, but she’s not sure what exactly she’s getting for the money. Only that the nice gentleman who came to the door were very concerned for her and insisted that she needed it. She’s moved now, and the water filter guys aren’t going down easy. The initially wanted the go ahead to move their filters to her new place (not allowed in the apartment building), and now they’re pestering her to get the new owner of the house to keep paying them. I’m hoping the young living rep shows their face to complain that the payments stopped- I have some harsh words I’ve been saving for them.</div>

I am Australian. Culture and systems definitely play a role in viewpoint.   
  
I have also never worked in a full corporate position. All of my professional experience has been in roles and organisations that I am passionate about. I am lucky that I have the opportunity to be selective - I have never "worked for a paycheck", and that plays a role in how I view my value. If you can, reframe how you see it. 

All the best.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think Genie is an example of this specific medium quickly reaching the current frontier of neural networks, rather than an example of progress past the frontier.

Language, audio, and images were the first medium to fully utilize neural networks, then video reached the same parity, now world models have caught up.

So I think it's more that current neural network technologies are being fully applied to different contexts and not that these contexts themselves are experiencing exponential progress beyond it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">While Codex CLI, for the moment, lacks the nice UI and feature set that Claude Code has, Codex CLI has in my opinion so far avoided doing extra things I didn't ask Claude Code to do. It won't blindly agree with me e.g. you're absolutely right, and usually will give me a pros/cons kind of discussion first if one is warranted. It's not overly eager at jumping straight into doing something if there are serious things to consider first. It appears to more consistently stick to the existing patterns in the codebase. It simply does what I ask and no more than that, with some follow up questions or opportunities for me.

Overall, so far, I'm impressed with Codex CLI. I've used Claude Code on Max 20x for possibly 2-3 months. Don't get me wrong, Claude Code is still amazing, but I may downgrade and continue using Codex CLI more if it continues to impress me.

What I feel we currently have is one product which has an excellent UI and feature set, but a model that has some flaws and needs a bit of babysitting to stop it wandering too far off course, and on the other hand we have a product that's bland and somewhat basic, but a model which doesn't blindly agree with me, doesn't do things I didn't ask it to do on a regular basis, and overall sticks to what I wanted with a much higher context limit. I'm not finding myself having to compact or start a new conversation regularly unlike in Claude Code currently.</div>

Fortunately the CLI is open source. I actually used codex to fix its own bug, just told it that windows approval doesn’t appear to work properly and it found the issue and fixed it.

I then recompiled it and then set it up as a custom CLI in the codex extension settings for vs code and now it works as expected, no more annoying approval prompts when set to full auto

And very dumb. It loves to wreck my code. I do not trust it at all anymore. Even simple tasks, it can fuck up.

Give this model low risk tasks like "move this over there" or "change the color of this component". Or one very good usecase: "scan my codebase and tell me this....". It reads files very quick so that's probably the best and only good usecase for this model.</div>

The **inner loop** is the control cycle of a single agent that hat gets some work (human or otherwise) and tries to complete it with the assistance of an LLM.

If Soros is capable of everything that he is accused of, with that ranking, while expending the money and maintaining his wealth, what are the other 490 billionaires ahead of him doing with their money?</div>

They acknowledged that people are going to use it anyway, so they've made Copilot available to all employees, and encourage people to see if they can find ways to use it to help them. The guy running the meeting (who is the head of technology) even said he used AI to create the slides he used for the meeting, which took 5 minutes and a few prompts instead of an hour or two. They have no plans to reduce work staff with AI, but rather empower them.

I was relieved by the enlightened take (there was never an official communication/policy about AI use before today).</div>

Aside from looking great (you do!) and your clothes fitting comfortably for a change (I bet that feels amazing) you're saving yourself from crippling pain in your later years. I carried an extra hundred pounds around for a long ass time and when it was leaving I remember climbing stairs and thinking 'hey.. that didnt hurt..'  Same with getting something off of the floor. Good for you... Its a lot of work and I commend you for it :)</div>
