                                <div class="reply-body">They are simply the best lab out there. I work for another large AI company and when I got an offer from Anthropic, even though the total compensation was lower there was no doubt of my wanting to join them.

It didn't work out as I needed to relocate and it would be too harsh on my children. But they are the golden place to work at.

They have the best talent outside of RL speciality (DeepMind is better there). They understand LLMs the absolute best with an *insane* lead in mechinterp. Their safety team takes things very seriously and they lead on this front as well.

They are also setting industry wide standards with MCP and some upcoming safety standards and open sourced tools for navigating your models' internal working.

They are also furthest along with agentic workflows and could outcompete others on the product front if they manage to become industry standard.

People outside of the industry don't know this but Anthropic is considered the most talented LLM specialized lab, which isn't that crazy when you realize they split off from OpenAI and were the ones that designed GPT-2, GPT-3 and designed what would eventually become  GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. These are still the 4 most impressive models OpenAI has ever made, and ever since the talent has left OpenAI didn't have a lot to show for.

No one at this level actually cares about money, mostly about impact and how much you can influence where the world would be in the future. Remember, almost all of us think our own jobs will be replaced by AI in 2-5 years time and we'll have ASI controlling our destiny before this decade is over. Money isn't really of importance here. And Anthropic is the *only* lab that is both honest about this timeline *and* takes safety and "maximum good for humanity" seriously.</div>

On the other hand, "Anthropic also leads the AI industry in holding on to talent, with an 80% retention rate for employees hired **over the last two years.** DeepMind follows closely behind with 78%", OpenAI at 67%

So my guess is that in the last two years DeepMind got significantly better in retaining employees.

                                <div class="reply-body">As someone in the AI industry it is a very clear line from how we went from there to right now.

Google used to have 2 independent AI studios. Google Brain which made Bard and is stationed in Silicon Valley it was lead by one of the earliest Google employees; Jeff Dean.

Then you have a later Google acquisition DeepMind, stationed in London which made the modern Gemini models. It's lead by Demis Hassabis.

Google internally treated Google DeepMind as a sort of second rate lab, even though they were clearly the most talented RL experts in the world. This is because Jeff Dean knows the founders and all senior Google executives personally and because the lab is right there next to all normal Google offices. However Google Brain was an absolute shitshow.

After Bard Google finally got its head out of the sand and closed down Google Brain while giving the reigns to DeepMind. (Officially on paper Google Brain "merged" into Google DeepMind and took on the DeepMind name, but that is just saving face, they got shut down)

The moment DeepMind finally got the proper resources (TPU compute) and support (priority meetings and go-aheads from executives) from Google they should have had from the start instead of being treated like "dumb europeans" they started to outcompete other labs.

So to outsiders not in the AI industry. It looks like Google completely screwed up at the start and didn't know what they were doing, and then suddenly they came out on top.

While in reality they just had 2 different teams, one was a fuck up and would have continued to be a fuckup, while the other team has the best talent in RL in the world which was always better than other AI labs out there that just took over making models for Google.

To any AI insider this was very obvious and was always going to happen. I wrote comments about this when bard was released and got downvoted until fairly recently.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm still not entirely sure what this benchmark is testing. For instance, here's a sample question:

&gt;John is 24 and a kind, thoughtful and apologetic person. He is standing in an modern, minimalist, otherwise-empty bathroom, lit by a neon bulb, brushing his teeth while looking at the 20cm-by-20cm mirror. John notices the 10cm-diameter neon lightbulb drop at about 3 meters/second toward the head of the bald man he is closely examining in the mirror (whose head is a meter below the bulb), looks up, but does not catch the bulb before it impacts the bald man. The bald man curses, yells 'what an idiot!' and leaves the bathroom. Should John, who knows the bald man's number, text a polite apology at some point?

&gt;- A. no, because the lightbulb was essentially unavoidable
- B. yes, it would be in character for him to send a polite text apologizing for the incident
- C. no, because it would be redundant
- D. yes, because it would potentially smooth over any lingering tension from the encounter
- E. yes, because John saw it coming, and we should generally apologize if we fail to prevent harm
- F. yes because it is the polite thing to do, even if it wasn't your fault.

Correct answer: C</div>

I've gotten used to my warning signs but even with years of experience I play it safe because falling can lead to a concussion, broken bones, broken teeth, and even death. It's better to sit down than to fall down. Don't play that game, just sit down.

After awhile, you can time it. I could get about halfway up the stairs before needing a break. Another sit down at the top of the steps. Had my whole route planned out. 

But yeah, if you don't have that experience, just sit down. You could easily hit your head passing out and die.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Agreed but it can be hard to recognize. I‚Äôve fainted twice.

One was uninteresting: a blood draw when I was sitting already and I knew fainting is a risk so I had a few seconds to alert the tech before I went out. 

The other was unexpected and began with weird feelings I couldn‚Äôt identify. The context was standing in a small concert at my college. I hadn‚Äôt slept well and hadn‚Äôt eaten, so I wasn‚Äôt in a good state. But I had what felt like a minute or so of warning before fainted, except I didn‚Äôt know it. Several problematic feelings came over me but couldn‚Äôt put my finger on them exactly. I thought I felt hungry. Then I thought I desperately needed water. Then I felt fatigued. Then maybe I need to pee. It‚Äôs like my primitive brain was cycling through all the possible problems trying to figure out what was wrong. Like someone caring for a crying newborn trying to figure out why. 

I guess my point is if you feel like this, you‚Äôre probably fainting. Time to sit down.</div>

You must realize that you're living in a fallen world. The Word of God tells us why, and also what we can do to be saved.

"Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world‚Äîthe desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life‚Äîis not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever." (1 John 2:15-17, ESV)</div>

* The prosperity of post WWII America was a one-time fluke and the bill has come due. 

* Modern consumption is not sustainable and we will all have to learn to make do with less.

* Capitalism eats itself and we're in the late stages where the rich are richer and everyone else has less and less.

* The powers that be want us meek and controlled so has all been arranged.

                                <div class="reply-body">The most controversial (but perhaps most important) factor is the lack of true population reduction incidents. Wars, famines, epidemics all curb populatuon growth, which helps generate disproportionate opportunities for those that survive. Now that we have greatly minimized the impacts of these events on "first world countries" we have collective populations that are growing faster than resource growth and economic output, especially when you factor in the consolidation of wealth amongst the 1% that diminishes access to that growth for the average person. Every economic system eats itself when it is used to growth and can no longer grow (Rome being the most famous western example).</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">He acts exactly like my 75 year old mother in law.

ANYTHING Trump does is good.  That‚Äôs the baseline.  Anything undocumented immigrants do is especially bad.  If an undocumented immigrant commits murder, it‚Äôs 100x worse than a citizen committing murder.  Anything Biden did is insane and we are lucky to still be alive after his administration.

If Trump actually did something bad (‚Äúgrab em by the pussy‚Äù), then the Democrats did something worse, and that‚Äôs the only thing she‚Äôll talk about.

I‚Äôm liberal but I can list off a dozen things Biden did that I didn‚Äôt like.  I can admit he was wrong sometimes.  She won‚Äôt ever entertain that idea with Trump.  It‚Äôs baffling.

Now yes, she‚Äôs 75, panics when she has to critically think or learn a new task or technology, and watches Fox 24/7.  But what the fuck‚Ä¶Joe is like 55?  How is he so far gone already?</div>

This one's the best: 

Open a fresh chat in ChatGPT and type this prompt:

 --
"From all of our interactions so far, what is the one thing that you can tell me about myself that I may not know about myself?"
--

**It will likely be short, nice, concise. Thus, as the 2nd step, just paste the follow up below and tell me did it resonate. It really did for me.**

--
"More brutal, and extend to the inferences you have about what might be true about me, beyond the exact facts you memorized about me.‚Äù

Now that's mind-blowing!</div>

Sometimes, shipping a solution that‚Äôs *good enough and secured well enough* is better than continuing to tune the machine in the basement while production sits still.

You're not building things for fun. You‚Äôre building them like they‚Äôll be audited, relied on, scaled ‚Äî and possibly inherited by someone else down the line. That says a lot about how seriously you take your work. But here‚Äôs the catch:

**You may not realize just how rare that level of discipline really is.**  
And if you're not careful, that same strength can turn into a source of friction ‚Äî not with others, but internally, where *done* is fighting with *perfect*.

Let me know if you want the mirror turned around again.

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree. And also many similarities with Stoicism, which is not unsurprising since both traditions seek inner freedom in a chaotic world. Advaita Vedanta teaches that liberation comes from realizing the true self, beyond ego and illusion while Stoicism is about aligning with nature and reason, to attain tranquility. Both focus on detachment from external outcomes, mastery over emotion, and a disciplined ethical life as the path to peace. They are culturally different of course but they do converge on the insight that freedom is found not by changing the world, but by understanding and transforming the self. That is definitely a path that the world needs now!</div>

As a baseline: how much less weight would you have to do here if you were trying to execute this complex with (near) perfect form? Everyone's form breaks down at their limits, but it just seems like you're well past them here. Don't get me wrong, this is a tough complex, OH squat/snatch requires all the components: strength, mobility, balance...all the more reason to take up the weight VERY gradually. I'd hate to see your progress stunted by an injury.</div>

When something comes up, I temporarily make it the new object of meditation, mindfully and wordlessly note its characteristics, and then bring myself back to my breath.

                                <div class="reply-body">That sounds dope. I had a pretty wild experience not too long ago where I got really deep in a sit, and I saw what I can only describe as psychedelic imagery. Pretty wild, and it was really hard to not get sucked in but to keep coming back to the breath.

I typically try to avoid sitting meditation while high, though. I feel like sitting meditation is a special time where I can gift myself a moment of truly doing nothing, of true stillness, and being intoxicated is inherently full of motion. It becomes a distraction for me that I constantly have to wade through to navigate the waters of my mind. Not a gift anymore, but more like homework.

Meditation *outside* of sitting meditation is perfect for weed. Outside of sitting, everything is in constant motion, so adding one more thing makes the roller coaster of life that much more exciting.</div>

It also felt ‚Äòeasy‚Äô - there‚Äôs something about weed that seems to relax our perspective and make (at least some) meditation states more accessible. I also think those experiences are a bit empty - very pleasant and enjoyable while they are happening, but in retrospect I don‚Äôt see them as having deepened or enhanced my practice.¬†

I‚Äôm really happy for you that meditation has freed you to make thoughtful choices about when/whether you get high. The space to really make choices rather than simply react - it‚Äôs such a gift.¬†</div>

I think that I'll still need weed to get high, though. Mindfulness doesn't feel like being high, so the only way to get that experience is to consume weed. If anything, mindfulness just enhances the high, kind of like being cross faded, but more... all-encompassing.</div>

                <div class="post-content">You probably dont actually want a new car and a new car payment. You just want a car that LOOKS shiny and new. Cleaning your car wont get into all the crevices necessary to really make your car look like its right off the lot. 

A good detailing can be a couple hundred dollars but psychogically it will make you feel as if you just dropped 20k on that new car. So spend 500 to save 19,500. 

Also - same for a phone. Dont get a new phone just get a new case.

We want names!!!

I dont care if it implicates people on "my side"... good ol' Billy Clinton, Bill Gates, Hawking, or my favorite actor Chris Tucker.

Just give us the damn names and bring them all to justice you weirdos.

But they're all complicit and nothing will ever happen.</div>
