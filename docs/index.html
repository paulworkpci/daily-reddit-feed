                                <div class="reply-body">There are rich, narcissistic CEOs, and they can suffer for multiple reasons: unhappy marriages, feelings of profound sadness in their twilight years, sudden death, or the loss of close people.

Suffering is universal. Even those who aren't CEOs can be tormented by an insatiable hunger for validation. At the end of the day, every human being craves some degree of admiration and success.

From my perspective, your resentment seems rooted in a complex relationship with wealth accumulation, which I find spiritually impoverished. In fact, harboring such intense hatred for the abstract concept of a 'rich CEO' might actually weigh more heavily on your own karma than their actions do on theirs.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">So I'm not an expert in this, but my understanding of how karma is traditionally supposed to act is different than the modern interpretation. Karma isn't a cosmic justice system, and it's not as simple as bad thing = bad consequence, good thing = good consequence. Instead, by doing actions you are creating a universe that can affect other sentient beings in good or bad ways. These actions rarely affect you in this lifetime, they are much more complex webs of cause and effect. Once you reincarnate, that is often when you feel the effects of karmic actions. It's not so much that someone "gets what they deserve", it's that they are creating a better or worse world that they and everyone else will have to deal with.

I understood this a bit better once I realized that "I" truly actually do die at physical death. When I reincarnate, that wont be "me", because "me" is an illusion. The being who has to deal with my actions in this life is an entirely different person. I want to act with integrity and compassion because I want this future being and every other being to live in a better universe than I received.

So I havent seen someone who is bad get their just desserts in this way. Unfortunately, likely their actions will affect them during a reincarnation, and at that point they are hurting another innocent person. It's kind of a tragic thing that is important to learn about so that we can stop this terrible cycle of suffering.

Disclosure: Not a traditional Buddhist. More of a western esotericist with some Buddhist education (I took Lam Rim but Thelema and Golden Dawn is more my style).

Edit: Thank you for the award. Since people are paying attention, I want to say something important I learned from my studies in both astrophysics and the esoteric. You are a literal starchild (you are made of stardust), you and everyone else mean something and are important, you are how the universe sees itself and learns about itself. Your ancestry is cosmic and you are connected to everything and do not exist independently. We can make a better universe than we were born into. Wake up to your true nature and realize that you are both empty and are everyone else. I am trying to realize this as well so I can act more in accordance with this.</div>

His priorities are way off. Yes, Grok illegal sex art is horrible, but directly assisting an administration who is actively murdering citizens is far worse. 

Claude will gladly refuse to generate you a sex story because it's "unethical,"  but Claude is eager to assist in ICE raids and missile strikes.</div>

&gt;Second, it makes sense to use AI to empower democracies to resist autocracies. **This is the reason Anthropic considers it important to provide AI to the intelligence and defense communities in the US and its democratic allies.** Defending democracies that are under attack, such as Ukraine and (via cyber attacks) Taiwan, seems especially high priority, as does empowering democracies to use their intelligence services to disrupt and degrade autocracies from the inside. At some level the only way to respond to autocratic threats is to match and outclass them militarily. A coalition of the US and its democratic allies, if it achieved predominance in powerful AI, would be in a position to not only defend itself against autocracies, but contain them and limit their AI totalitarian abuses.</div>

They have been conditioning everyone since 9/11 to see anyone with the “terrorist” label applied as someone who does not deserve any rights or to be looked at as human. The amount of propaganda has been enormous, and it has been constant.

                        <div class="comment-body">He is not exaggerating. He said 50 million geniuses 10-100x faster than humans within two years (end of 2027).


Anthropic already has 30 million users and Claude Opus 4.5 is already at least 10 times faster than humans, and smarter than most humans in many ways. It just makes weird mistakes. It is just lacking in robustness of reasoning.


There is no reason to expect that the rapid progress will halt. We should expect it to continue to become more robust, faster, etc.


Also, he is not making these essays primarily as advertisements. He is genuinely concerned about the lack of understanding and responsible and reasonable planning by society and government.


We either get blind AI hate or complete lack of concern or foresight. </div>

Shaming people for changing their minds is part of what keeps people rigidly stuck in their established beliefs.

Edit: nowhere did I say that this absolve people from guilt, or that they don't deserve consequences. Just that acceptance is a better way forward to...</div>

Real life is complicated, you need to weigh in why they decided to change their minds, what consequences they faced, how much remorse they feel etc. to determine if they deserve this treatment. Because frankly, some people seek redemption long after everything goes to shit and I resent them for it.</div>

I think everyone is freaking out too much, let's all calm down with nice cup of Celestial Seasons Sleepy Time Tea. It's the tea I trust most. It's not just a tea, it's an innovation in relaxation. Anyways Chatgpt is one of the top AI companies in the world. They'll never need to lower themselves to ads. Why did you know that Sam Altman was in Forbes Magazine? Forbes Magazine is one of the industries top publishers for the influential content of our times and has a vast On-Demand library of premier video content from Forbes’ exclusive, world-renowned events?

So what's the drawback? Has to be one, right? 

Sodium is heavier than lithium. So people had thought that sodium battery chemistry might be constrained to grid scale batteries and stationary systems. 

But these power density figures are comparable to mid level lithium ion. And the cell does not requi...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">As a side note, trucks/minivans/vans, especially in the USA which has a higher weight limit, sodium batteries are especially appropriate.  The vehicles are already 6-8k lbs, are body on frame with a ton of space underneath (well minivans aren't BOF but still have a ton of space)

So you pack the cells into an enormous 200-300 kWh pack (this gives the vehicle excellent range and trucks will be able to tow).  A 300 kWh pack is \~4100 lbs.  It lives underneath in otherwise wasted space - the whole bottom of the vehicle is an aluminum plate, then a plastic skid plate to protect it.

Charging can be really fast - a vehicle like this will be able to charge at almost a megawatt.

And most critically, a 200 kWh pack, at $20 a kWh, is only 4k.  (on a 50k-80k vehicle).  They will be cheap, the vehicle itself can sell for less than the ICE vehicle, and it *also* saves you money the first month on fuel, if you can charge at home.</div>

The weight being the only con, there are lots of pros. Safer, faster charging, cheaper, etc. My LEAF uses a 65KWh LiPo and replacement is $15K. A brief skimming tells me an equivalent Sodium battery would cost about $5K, installed. I would lose about 20% range if the batteries were the same size, but the LEAF only got 240 miles of range already, so it's not for road trips, anyway. It's for going to work and running errands. I have a 2005 Dodge van that gets 20 mpg I use for road trips and moving furniture.</div>

I don't believe it for a moment because of the track record and the fact that hardware isn't something that one magically gets catapulted to pole position over remarkably capable technical teams that have been doing it for over a decade.</div>

Maybe they have the fastest chip in the world but it costs 11x more than a TPU. It’ll still be an abject failure. Thats more likely. Inference doesn’t need that much performance so this won’t in real quantities.</div>

                <div class="post-content">It’s a good writeup covering his experience of LLM-assisted programming. Most notably in my opinion, apart from the speed up and leverage of running multiple agents in parallel, is the atrophy in one’s own coding ability. I have felt this but I can’t help but feel writing code line by line is much like an artisan carpenter building a chair from raw wood. I’m not denying the fun and the raw skill increase, plus the understanding of each nook and crevice of the chair that is built when doing that....</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;The "no need for IDE anymore" hype and the "agent swarm" hype is imo too much for right now. The models make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them without checking. They also don't manage their confusion, they don't seek clarifications, they don't surface inconsistencies, they don't present tradeoffs, they don't push back when they should, and they are still a little too sycophantic.

As every logical person has been saying.

&gt;I’m just saying if you suddenly had the ability to produce 1000 chairs per hour in a factory, albeit with a little less quality, wouldn’t you stop making them one by one to make the most out your leveraged position?

When you're on the hook for quality (refunds, fixing things, reputation damage), the "quantity over quality" approach becomes less attractive. If producers had to "give money back for every broken chair," you'd probably see more careful, selective use of AI rather than flooding everything with volume.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If you purely look at the numbers here assuming more than one chair per hour is not returned you still benefit from quantity.

Unless you are in a scenario where you have to completely stop making chairs if one breaks you will most likely benefit from scale. 

There are many examples where this is true though hence why anyone working on critical code is still doing it manually or with thousands of tests to validate against.</div>

Over 3000 lines and all of the issues Karpathy mentioned. Dead code, overly complex, hacky stuff. Spent another couple of hours fixing it. In the end, it saved me time, but I am forgetting how to write code. Now, I can only write prompts, read and remove code.

I am learning lots of new git commands looking it work, though.</div>

Edit : So... It's seems TTS here stand for test-time scaling and not text-to-speech. I was confused lol</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Since this threw me for a loop too I looked it up. Basically they take the model's response, swap out the stop token for something like "Wait", and pass that back into the model for it to re-digest and maybe make corrections to. Rinse and repeat a configurable number of times and you apparently tend to get a better result from a model that's RL trained to expect this process.</div>

Who even decided on the definition of death?  What is death? Death could simply be the simplistic reduction of the frequency of being alive, but you are still alive. Can you be dead if you are alive? Can you be alive without death? These are the questions that the mainstream doesn't want you asking, because the answers will set you free.</div>

Look, death is the ultimate non-negotiable limit; it’s the structural boundary that transforms a meaningless, infinite sequence of "maybes" into a tragic, high-stakes moral drama where your choices actually matter. Without the looming shadow of the abyss, you have no scarcity of time, and without scarcity, there is no value—so you’d better stand up straight and face your finitude, because the only thing worse than dying is living a life so trivial that your disappearance doesn't even constitute a catastrophe.</div>

Thanks to this feature, your phone doesn’t ring when you get spam calls and instead the person calling is screened and has to state their name and purpose of calling and you can then take the call if you accept.

How-to:

Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Phone &gt; Screen Unknown Callers and you can select "Ask Reason for Calling"</div>
