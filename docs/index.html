AI experts vary drastically in their assessment of what AI can do today, whether they are potentially dangerous or not, and what the implications are for the world.

Why not have an independent taskforce that aggregates evidence such as studies and expert opinions? Such a meta study would be waaaay more reliable than any individual expert's opinion.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">Those sorts of task forces exist. The reason why you don’t hear about them, but you hear about these hearings is that humans are more swayed by rhetoric and anecdote rather than data.

I’ve gotta say Veo 2 has a sizable lead over sora, but Sora has its own unique take on it, even if more “simple”. Alas, there is more important work to be done. Brilliant work from Veo 2 though.</div>

Like I said yesterday the term AGI is a distraction, If an AI is winning Nobel prizes in physics, coding entire applications and discovering new medical treatments are we going to say "yeah but it only got 45% on ACR-AGI v3??

That's EXACTLY where I'm at as well

It's all starting to kinda lose the plot. What are we even really measuring at this point? The classic example use to be an AI that can fool a human. Even the free current models are pretty close to that, let alone o3. Now we have these more 'complex' benchmarks, and the AI keeps demolishing those as well.

So we are kinda at a point where we are playing gotcha by coming up with something it can't do, to claim it's still not AGI. Rather than accepting what it already is, we are just finding random new holes to make some arbitrary point.</div>

We could solve maths entirely and still not have AGI, because AGI is a different thing to extreme skill in specific domains. Obviously that would be massively impressive and groundbreaking, but AGI is a separate thing.

"AGI" is important for different reasons that advancing technology. If you had a sufficiently capable AGI system, you could replace *a lot* of people's jobs. On the other hand, narrower forms of intelligence only affect specific professions.</div>

Llm is not just one entity, it's based on transformers, layering of neurons aka neural network

O series is llm + search algorithm + test time compute.

I don't get people saying , this architecture won't do.

We are already away from basic llms by gpt 4 turbo.</div>

The ARC-AGI benchmarks can be resilient to the effects of data contamination as long as each task continues to be truly novel.</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">Yes! But real world solutions also aren’t some engineer doing a night shift preparing a product out of nothing. Real world solutions are like talking to customer for days cumulatively to get a rough idea of what they want. Then talking to bunch of high level technical people to find out how this can be done within budget and without reinventing the wheel. Then someone writes it down in a form understandable for everyone, then someone else breaks it down into digestible small chunks aka tickets. And devs start working on those chunks. Then multiply everything with 3 because there is a lot of back and forth communication after the development starts all the way from customer to developer including all the intermediate steps. It is a giant machinery. No one human is able to replace all the roles effectively. But I also agree that the AI today is not ready to replace any single cog in the machinery. But we are getting there slowly.
Also it is just unfair to expect todays AI to do all that on its own, because most humans cannot either.</div>

There is a step function change when models can get direct feedback from the environment and operate closed-loop. I've had a little taste of this with agentic cursor + Sonnet 3.6 and it is *great*. o3 in harness will be an absolute beast, and I'm sure Gemini 2.0 Pro and Anthropic's next gen model will also be very strong.

It doesn't have to implement an entire job in one click. Moving to autonomously completing subtasks *with verification* is an enormous step. We will get hours of work done in minutes.</div>

It's smarter than o1-preview, but randomly doesn't think long enough. It often spends less than 10 seconds thinking and then calls it a day, spitting out naively incorrect answers and coding results that that aren't much better than 4o.

Even though o1-preview isn't as smart, it always spends a long time thinking giving the best answer it possibly can.

I think the benchmark results are skewed because of this.</div>

This is normal behavior for a lot of things even humans need. There's a reason the first installment of a video game series will start out with more minor missions that get you to practice the mechanics of the game and get familiar with the goals.

and from what I've seen this is intentional on the benchmark design side. They don't want to test o3 on how well it does ARC, they want it to understand how the ARC test works so that it can prove it knows what to do now.</div>

AI is going to continuously improve, everyday, every week, every month. New models will be released each one breaking the previous benchmarks, hardware will continuously improve. 

Eventually,   
The line between the tech we have &amp; AGI, will be a very thin line.

Hey r/singularity

So, I had a bit of an argument with my partner last night, and it's got me thinking about the future of AI and healthcare.  She's brilliant, but she's also a bit of a traditionalist, especially when it comes to medicine.

I was talking about how amazing it would be if AI could essentially train anyone to be a competent doctor, regardless of their background.

o3-mini shows that OpenAI can increase performance while also reducing costs, and it is probably the model that we will actually get access to in ChatGPT. To me, this represents OpenAI's goal of driving the cost of intelligence to zero. This will be very important for things like agents to make sense financially!</div>

If we look at some of the compute they used for ARC AGI. They had dozens of millions of tokens for one task.

Normal LLMs can’t really deal with the absurdly long context. So if they used some kind of additional search on top of that.  That wouldn’t really be autoregressive LLM.

LLM would be part of a larger system in that case.</div>

                    <div class="comment-body">I don't understand this idea that search is bad because somehow it feels like a brute force solution. Clearly we have different parts of the brain that all interact to give us reasoning. One of those aspects feels very strongly to me like some kind of search. When I am thinking about a hard problem, in my head, I am searching across previous experience, I am running possible outcomes of solutions I want to try, I am planning, etc.

Can someone explain why some of these researchers are so insistent on reasoning that doesn't involve search?</div>

                        <div class="reply-body">I think he’s making a distinction between a “dumb” search of possible outcomes and a chain of thought that similarly might explore the same outcomes but likely won’t because its ability to reason at each step allows it to skip whole branches that a dumb search would have to consider. 

I think the “beautiful” part is that, while a CoT reasoning LLM might explore multiple different paths, it does so sequentially where each newly generated token is still the “product” of all the other tokens in the context. So if the reasoning goes down a bad path but then reconsiders, even the tokens generated to explore that bad path are somehow being factored into the exploration of the next, hopefully better path. My guess is this is much more similar to your own experience of thinking on hard problems than a dumb search of all possible solutions. 

So reasoning is still a kind of search, but it’s a search where “experience” is baked into every token produced.</div>

The CoT reasoning is basically a search process, and the STaR approach fine tunes models to learn from successful searches.  Isn't that how we do hard searching?  You mentally go step by step and have an intuition about when you are headed in the right direction.  Good problem solvers have learned from how they solved problems in the past.  You don't explicitly generate a bunch of solutions, then search over that space to find a good one.  Or maybe you do eventually, but anything you explicitly generate is something you already have a hunch is likely to work.</div>

                    <div class="comment-body">Yeah people are acting like this was just a joke, but I think they were being serious out of sheer excitement for how good this model that they directly worked on turned out to be. Sam wanted to immediately shut down that self-improvement conversation since a *lot* of people would start freaking out if OpenAI was so nonchalant about letting their models improve themselves. Sam is always worried about public image, since that’s a big part of his role. 

It should be obvious to everyone that OpenAI (and every other AI company) is working on an automated AI researcher. If they are saying only one guy at OpenAI is better at programming (Codeforces) than o3, are we really going to say o3 couldn’t improve itself? Of course it could if given the chance, and they probably test that capability every day in a sandbox environment they can easily control.

I’m not surprised people still wonder if this is possible or not since almost no one here reads the latest research papers on arXiv, but the original GPT-4 could literally improve itself. It’s not a question of whether it is possible as that has already been proven with a much worse model.</div>

Looks like some of the coast guardsmen who claimed their boat was followed by a fleet of mystery drones are starting to speak out after the White House accused them of misidentifying commercial airliners flying into JFK international airport.

“It’s the implication that’s insulting,” said the Coast Guard member, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “It’s implying we’re making sh-t up, when the ones making up sh-t are down in Washington, D.C.”

We were actually out there to see if we could spot any drones, because of all these sightings. Well, we found some drones. Or more accurately, they found us .

I’m terrible with measurements, but [the swarm] was about 80 to 100 feet above us. They had four propellers. Seven feet across. The flashing lights, like you’ve seen. The festive green, red, and white lights, around 20 knots, which is just over 20 miles an hour. 

Commercial airplanes don’t move like that. I’ve been out there when planes were coming in for landings in New York, and trust me, you can tell the difference. We’re not idiots, we know what drones look and sound like.

 I can’t pretend to know what’s going on, because I don’t, but they weren’t the types of drones you can buy at the store. These were government drones. If [the drone swarm] fired at us or engaged us in any way, we would’ve fired back.”

In fact Gary Nolan has possession of some of this material from the Ubatuba UFO incident from Brazil in 1957. Remember also that Elizondo said, a while back, that the exterior "skin" of a UFO may actually be it's propulsion mechanism, and that it sheds it as it moves. It always reminds me of a Sacrificial Anode placed on a boat that is there specifically to corrode and protect the rest of the metallic surfaces from corroding.</div>

Did we come up with a reasonable explanation for this one? I remember it being talked about a decent amount but I can’t remember why people just stopped discussing/ posting about it. I happened to just randomly remember it and tried to find anything about in various subreddits, but found nothing. This was the one image I found on Google.

The photos came from a Twitter account that claimed to be a pilot. It had been created about a month before these were posted and was deleted shortly after. Some details about the story came from another account claiming to have made contact with the original poster. 


The story went that these photos were sent to the pilot by colleagues. ATC had been made aware of the object, sent a vehicle to investigate, and the sphere had at that point shot up in the air.   


There was no metadata with the photos and the one video of the supposed object showed a small sphere already in the air. They were supposedly taken in June.


When a drone was spotted above Gatwick Airport in London a few years back they grounded all flights because of the risk of collision.


This would also have happened in Manchester if there was anything to this story. Some flights were grounded for a few hours one day in June (reportedly because of a fire) but this affected only 2 of the terminals. If there was an unknown object over the runway the collision risk would have shut down all terminals, since they all use that same runway.



So I don't know what this is, but the supposed pilot's account cannot be accurate.</div>

Exactly.. It's been funny watching the complete lack of critical thinking on this sub. I'm all for finding the truth out and learning about UAPs etc but people have literally been posting videos of aeroplanes and out of focus stars and categorically stating "This is NIH"

Here's a link to the tweet where I got this. The person who tweeted this, is also the one who recorded it:

Since I personally live in a village, with no immediate airport around, I can't vouch for whether or not this is real but I do think that it looks very good- especially the one in the back that just appears out of nowhere! What do you guys think?

                    <div class="comment-body">In the original tweet, the person says that this occurred around 8:40PM and he was somewhere near Budd Lake, NJ. I didn't see them mention which direction they were looking. However, if they were looking *west* they would have seen [four planes lining up to land at EWR](https://imgur.com/7ta9fvO), which is what this looks like.

EDIT: [Here's a video](https://streamable.com/2kdtn1) of the same thing over a larger period of time which should make it even more clear what's happening here. Obviously, OP's video isn't as long, but just watch *how many* planes follow that same "path" of the first I clicked on its approach to EWR.

EDIT2: Go watch the flight track for [UAL1559](https://www.flightradar24.com/2024-12-22/01:42/20x/UAL1559/38701bd5). At around 01:42UTC it makes a left hand turn that would take it *horizontally*, left to right, across the field of view of someone around the Budd Lake, NJ area who was looking west. That's the thing at the beginning of the video that even many folks insistent that these are *not* airplanes acknowledge is an airplane. The others, further away in a line, are:

While there are hundreds of sighting of these drones over US airspace &amp; military bases, there have also been several over US bases in the United Kingdom. The news in America coming from the Government is that these are simply hobby drones and commercial planes, regardless of what other sources (such as the Coast Guard) say. Over on The Times website, a U.K. news outlet, they posted an article with investigators claiming to not know what these drones are, or who is in control of them. However they do point out that they are not simply hobby drones due to their sophistication, which contradicts the US Gov &amp; Kirby’s press release. Interesting stuff!

If they were military grade drones, they would need to find the right frequency to jam and disable them. 

After years of conflict, Ukraine has managed to get up to ~70% success rate with EW vs Russian drones.

Drones over UK’s American airbases ‘may be controlled by hostile state’ The unidentified drones use technology so sophisticated that the authorities have been unable to track them, capture them or identify those responsible

Two Cobra meetings have been held in secret after unidentified drones were flown over military bases, involving technology so sophisticated the authorities have been unable to track them or identify those responsible.

Military officials have not ruled out the involvement of a hostile state but have expressed alarm that it has so far proved impossible to find the pilots responsible for controlling the drones.

The Times has learnt there have been at least two meetings of Cobra, the emergency response committee, over the mystery drones flown over American airbases in England. Military police, troops including members of the US Navy and police with drone expertise have been investigating the incursions over RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, RAF Fairford and RAF Feltwell.

Investigators believe the drones were not programmed but were controlled in real time by live operators.

The drones were flown around the bases in late November and early December and varied in size and configurations, according to the US military. The authorities have ruled out the work of hobbyists because of the sophistication of the technology involved and also because the flights were co-ordinated over a series of days.

However, despite the advanced technology available at the military bases, they were unable to track the drones’ signals or pinpoint launch locations. No drones have been captured, which would have allowed their examination, and they were not affected by electronic countermeasures such as jamming.

A Whitehall source said: “They’re very sophisticated, very fast. This is not the work of hobbyists but no one is confident of attribution at the moment.”

On some nights at Lakenheath, where facilities to house nuclear weapons are under construction, dozens of drones were in the sky above the base. British and American intelligence services conducted an intensive investigation that examined whether the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency, was responsible.

A US intelligence source said: “It seemed to us that it was plausible the Russians were behind the flights but it could have been non-state groups. There has been no firm evidence that Russians were involved.”

The first indication that the spy flights might have been Russian-operated came during initial investigations into drone sightings between November 20 and 26 over four bases, including RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire, where four B-52 bombers were deployed as part of an American task force.

Last month a European military source said there was intelligence that the GRU was involved. It sparked alarm at all airbases and airports in the UK.

The US warned that it reserved the right to defend its airbases. “To safeguard operational security, we do not discuss specific protection measures. However, we retain the right to protect our installations,” a spokesman said previously.

The Times previously reported that RAF personnel were using the Orcus counter-drone system to help the US protect its bases. The system can electronically take command of an enemy drone and turn it on itself, to find the operators. The system comprises of various parts that come together to find, identify and track drones. The Ninja — negation of improvised non-state joint aerial-threats — can identify targets up to four miles away.

Yet officials are still unclear about who is responsible for the incursions.

The Ministry of Defence said: “We take threats seriously and maintain robust measures at defence sites.” Advertisement

The mysterious drone activity in England stopped in the first week of December. It was followed by a spate of activity on the eastern seaboard of the United States. Flying objects have been seen over New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland.

John Kirby, the White House security adviser, said on Monday that the drones were a combination of law enforcement, professional and hobbyist aircraft.</div>

Submission Statement:


Harald Malmgren (former Whitehouse advisor) backs up this new deep dive report from the Liberation Times about a 1960's nuclear test as it relates to a downed UFO. This is a highly researched and significant part of the puzzle, which is only more intriguing due to his endorsement.

We'll see an uptick in activity if there's an escalation of things, but humans are remarkably adaptable to any kind of change. If the current "drone" activity remained the same over the next few weeks, people will stop even recording it and just accept it, particularly if there's no obvious harm. 


Personally, I'm hoping it's just the tide moving out a bit before surging back in. We'll see. </div>

My friend in Austria told me he saw a blue orb flying above his house, then a few smaller orange ones appeared to come out of it, go down pick something up and then go back to the blue orb. 

Sorry for the shitty Pic, it's the only one but never heard of sightings in Austria. </div>

Excuse the Pic, it was the only one he took but was more interested in what he described. This is someone who knows nothing about the topic whatsoever so him explaining what he saw was just purely his own account and eerie how similar it was to other accounts.

I know no one here knows him but he's a good friend and nothing to gain from lying, he never even believed in this before today and now is very confused/shocked.

He said the way they were moving was like nothing he's ever seen and he sees lots of planes all the time since he goes out at night daily to have a smoke.

He said the smaller orange ones almost looked like Dyson "structures".

No wonder people don't wanna come forward..

He literally knows nothing about UAPS or any of this and he explained to a tee what he saw and it was so similar to many accounts I've read of blue and fiery orbs.

Felt I had to share it whether people believe it or not, I live up north in sweden and always wish to see something so was surprised that he told me since I rarely hear of UAPS in northern/central Europe.</div>

I did find his account quite interesting though since I know he  has never read about the topic so he's as unbiased as can be,  it's just his first raw reaction on what he saw right after it happened. 

Tldr : 

Blue larger orb growing very bright, moving around slowly but not super fast. Much brighter than anything else in the sky. 

A couple smaller "Dyson structure" (partly hollow?) looking spheres with almost a fiery look to them that went close to the ground then back up to the blue orb like they were interacting and they moved much quicker than the blue one. 

Then the orange orbs just flew off super fast like blink of an eye and he didn't see them again.

He said he thought it seemed like the orange ones were bringing something to the blue one, or looking for something at least.</div>

For the past week we've been seeing then, and there were posts saying about how they're gonna go to these places and chase them, then we don't even have any high res photos?

If they are on the verge of an overdose I don't think it would do anything as it wouldn't affect oxygen saturation. </div>

                    <div class="comment-body">They’re so excited to fix non-existent or minuscule issues while the rich steal all the Country’s wealth and make life harder for everybody. It’s very disheartening and frustrating to watch.

It’s all a circus.

I also feel bad for those in these groups all this hate is targeting. If you’re trans, an immigrant or hell just poor this is an awful thing to witness or experience, and I’m sorry people are like this. 

They want a christo-fascist nationalist nation with a slave/indentured servant population that exists to serve the wealthy &amp; upper class.</div>

Every liberal virtue signaler switched to they them to be part of the lbgtq and moderates were like omfg this is so lame. So republicans for once were on the right side of a culture war issue. But it’s dying down now however they are still going to ride this out. It’s still in a lot of people’s memories so it still has some life left in it</div>

Liberals just say oh, 9 year old puberty blockers, no big deal, completely reversible, non-issue since it's a small portion of the population.
