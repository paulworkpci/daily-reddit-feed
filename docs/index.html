It's amazing how easily they seem to do this. I imagine the engineers must be happy. They can run some R&amp;D program to improve things and then just off-load the cost onto the loyal crowd of collectors. For other manufacturers, this whole rebody thing the exotic manufacturers do must be enviable.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I did that once. In 2003 I was at a testing session at the former El Toro Marine Base with one of the major auto magazines for a high-school mentorship I had. We were there to measure the not-yet-released 2004 Maxima (a MASSIVE departure from Nissan’s previous design language). I brought my digital SLR camera and was granted permission to shoot some photos, but it never occurred to anybody to inform me **not** to upload my photos to a car forum later that afternoon. About an hour later I received a message from someone asking for permission to use my photos somewhere else. About an hour after that, I was browsing rentals at Blockbuster when my mentor called me. “Hey, so, did you post your pictures to the internet? Yeah, um, that car is pre-production and there’s a media embargo…”

Sorry about that, Doug.</div>

Even things like when the republicans refused to vote on Obamas Supreme Court pick for a year until he was out of office so they could install a conservative judge. That’s just one example. Republicans gave up decorum and FairPlay quite a while ago to move into the zone of “fuck you, we’re taking what we want.” They have enough public support to do it. There is a point where they would not have enough public support to do it, but they are so good at manipulating the media and public opinion that I don’t know if we’ll ever get there.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">One wonders why ghislaine had submarine operator certification.

There's a territory also in Antarctica called New Schwabenland that was settled by the Nazis, and only accessible by their complex U-boat submarines.

Is there a correlation between these things? Is there a breakaway civilization in Antarctica that is involved in the enormous global child trafficking network? 

The rabbithole goes very deep, and very far back into history. Nobody knows what the khazarian mafia is or their origins because of the "anti semite" dogwhistle. 

Who funds this child trafficking network? Who benefits? Which intelligence agencies are involved in its cover-up, and from which countries are these agencies?

Ghislaine's father, Robert Maxwell is a prominent Mossad figure. What does Israel really do with their billions of dollars worth of our tax dollars?

Catherine Austin Fitts explains the breakaway civilization very well. Once you go down that rabbithole the financial world will never look the same</div>

The files can never be released because then They will lose that blackmail. The names on the list are all pawns. If they came out then yes, people will come to take heads. However. All the emphasis on those names is just another trick of the Press. To distract from the obvious truth that the whole thing is a Mossad honeypot. If people realised that en masse, what on earth would that imply about America's "greatest ally" in the middle east? The real names you want aren't Epstein's clients. The names you want are Epstein's staff. And Epstein's commandants.</div>

People were often shocked by how inefficient many companies are. Like one’s person entire job was picking up a large printout and carrying to the program manager. Or creating a report once a month that literally only took 1 hour/month since they had all the data.

I never really held it against them as managers often protect certain individuals, but some of it was pretty ridiculous.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This 1000% 👆. AI generally manages a lot better at cranking out greenfield code. Far different experience when it is working in an established codebase. To be fair, the same is true of human devs. I get why comparisons are for greenfield toy apps, but most dev time is spent working with existing code bases.

It would be interesting to use a large opensource codebase as the source for the benchmark (something like gitlab) and test how well these models can implement features or fix bugs.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's the same for all others. Claude Sonnet 3.5 was very promising at natural-sounding writing/language/translation tasks, but it got visibly worse and worse from 3.5 to 3.7, and 3.7 to 4, because it became more and more coding-focused.

I understand that they prioritise who funds them, but if LLMs are going to be ultra-smart code assistants, then they should stop creating a hype like they're going to save humanity. Enjoy your coding tool, but just be honest and don't advertise it like it's for everyone.

Besides the financial reasons, I also think that since they're coders, they're living in their own bubble. That's why they think they're making their models smarter in a general sense, while all they do is making them better coding tools. All those bold claims they come up with, like how their next model will have PhD-level intelligence or how we'll have Nobel Prize winner intelligence in a few years... They have no idea how human intelligence works. I studied Cognitive Science which is interdisciplinary, and it provides a wider and more realistic view on AI. From computing perspective only, it's easy to think that if you just make computers smarter, you'll have a digital Einstein.</div>

This country needs the employees to be in terror 24/7, like Elon says. 

But kids now, they are all communist and say things like "who are you and why are you chaining me to this production line" and "I don't want to compete with China by undercutting their wage costs" and "it's my 10th birthday can I have some water please sir"</div>

He was an acquaintance via my daughter in day-care at the time (dad of her friend). They were moving, but couldn't get anyone to help so he asked, as a long-shot, if I could come. I did.

Turns out he's an avid gamer like me, so we have literally had sleep-overs to play retro console games or have LANs. Also taught me disc golf.

So, yes. This tip works.</div>

Strangely, people like you *more* if you ask them for a small help (and get them appreciated) than if you actually help them. Their internal feedback loop is more powerful.</div>

&gt;"However, he explains, there is also an economic problem factoring into drug-resistant infections - "how do you make drugs that have no commercial value?"

&gt;If a new antibiotic was invented, then ideally you would use it as little as possible to preserve its effectiveness, making it hard for anyone to turn a profit.

This is where the reporter shows how Capitalism had infiltrated everywhere. The idea that something that is life-saving can be deemed worthless if it can't make you rich.

The whole point of economic systems is distribution of resources. Making people rich is just an incentive. If something is required, i.e. life saving medicine, is needed, then the government would just make it available for its population. You can't leave everything to profitability or you end up like the USA.</div>

the entire stagnantion of bio-medicine is coz of socialism, not capitalism. 

your socialism mandates drugs and therapies takes BILLIONS to get approved due to excessive regulations and clinical trials, and most drugs fail and lose it all. 

under capitalism the world would practically be disease free by now with modern tech. 

but yeah, keep fantasizing about the evil capitalism when the real world , at least in medicine field, is very much socialism</div>

If your clothes are dripping, the water can move through the bottom of the drying drum and drip onto the motor; shorting it out.

If you have a rental, you could be held responsible for the dryer by doing this.

If you own the equipment, it can save you from having to repair/replace both your wash...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The weight is the main issue. The drive belt on the dryer is usually surprisingly small in cross section. But, they don't expect that people will put dripping wet clothes in their dryer. That's not what they're designed for. That's why washers have a spin cycle. If you did overload it with dripping wet clothes, the thin drive belt would snap before the motor burned out. This is on purpose. (So, maybe they DO expect people to put dripping wet clothes in their dryer.)</div>

Use a weaker and faster version in production without fully acknowledging that this instance would not score nearly as well on benchmarks (or really work as well, in most situations).

Put a router in front that serves something close to the top model an insignificant percentage of the time, so you can truthfully, but dishonestly say that the best model is available through the web interface for free users (once a day, if they say the right magic words in the prompt).</div>

So I think it makes sense for it to be highly API-focused, with the frontend being a more basic implementation of it. I guess what I'm saying is that the extra thinking would go to waste without the application built around it to harness that extra thinking. Sure, the ChatGPT app does have some tools and routing and whatnot for the agent to "think" about, but also it's their own environment that they could optimize for to not require it to think as hard.

Just some guesses.</div>

In advanced LLM deployment, tone shapes trust and user perception just as much as accuracy. Knowing how to calibrate that is kinda the secret sauce for solid AI interaction design.</div>

Haven't extensively tested it,
Don't code with it,

And I already had my model output dry, precise responses so not missing any personality aspects.

There is a lot of outcry atm, so Im not denying that it isn't working out for many.
Just haven't noticed a problem personally.</div>

I've had less hallucinations so far.  I HATED the sycophantic personality of 4o, so the new Spock talk is great for me.

It's not a huge improvement, that is disappointing, but for how I use it is a big improvement in almost every way.</div>

Most of the infrastructure in the west is still based on all the stuff we build in the 50s and 60s. And a lot of that infrastructure never got the proper investment needed for maintenance.

Not only that, China can produce nearly all of the products and inputs for maintaining infrastructure domestically, while the US needs to import a lot of it. Ironically much of it from China directly, or passing through China at some point in the production cycle.</div>

The problem is you need to get folks to stop shitting themselves over windmills, solar panels, and nuclear being built near them. The biggest impediment is that an HOA might organize a sit-in at a random city hall and browbeat the zoning board into killing the project because Margaret doesn't want those bird-killing windmills near her.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s as much permitting and imminent domain litigation as cost (although they are obviously interrelated). In the U.S. we hold property right sacrosanct, so some farmers can hold things up for years in litigation. China culturally has much less emphasis on property rights so they just plow right over whatever land they need. It’s no different than building high speed rail or housing. 

China is about the collective and thinking in decades, the U.S. is all about the individual and thinking short-term. It’s no surprise this is how things would go. Unless and until there is the political wherewithal for something akin to the new deal, we’re going to fall behind.</div>
