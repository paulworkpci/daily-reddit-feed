I’m curious because that evolving model was just released, wina was just debuted and the. The whole ai without memory transversing a maze, and becoming more efficient after each transversal leading the researchers to believe that AI memory is being affected in the actual weights of the model by super positioning, causing the weights to actually contain memory?

As someone who has just gotten up close to this stuff and has noticed there’s never a shortage of new stuff on the horizon. Are these types of things typical because from what I’ve seen the trajectory towards ASI is like pretty clear to me, but I am only two months in.</div>

We already know both MCP (likely this wk) and GPT-5 (next month) are on the way.  Looking forwards the main stuff cooking are reasoning updates past 04 for GPT-5 every 3 months or so until Stargate is up and running for systems beyond that. 

One other wildcard is perhaps the creative writing model Sam showed earlier this year possibly being open sourced. Releasing it rather soonish would allow all focus to be on GPT-5 soon after.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Indexing is unbelievable!  In side by side tests in ask mode asking questions about the codebase indexing comes out ahead every-time. Without indexing sometimes the LLM is able to surmise which files to look in based on proper directory structure and file names and utilize the more basic search tools available to find the same thing as o design does but always at the expense of tokens.

https://docs.roocode.com/features/experimental/codebase-indexing

In terms of Cline’s stance, we’re not up against them so it’s not really concerning to me that they’re taking a different direction. Cursor and Windsurf have made a lot of the correct calls on how to do things so we’re going to take our lead from them on this.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The last time I used cursor they were not doing actual context compression to extend the length of time the agents can work on the tasks. They were i think using weaker models to compress every prompt to the stronger models and not giving full context access. 

I think the cool part about the Roo solution is that you can manage when context compression triggers and you can build your own recipe for the context compression. Claude code's for example is very effective. 

So it lets both the orchaestrator agent adn the agents themselves to manage their own context, and perform better on longer running tasks / get more done in a single pass or task.  It's been pretty stellar for me so far.</div>

Was so busy trying to meditate perfectly I forgot to actually meditate.

Yesterday I just sat down. No timer. No special position. Just sat and breathed.

Thoughts came. Let them. Leg got uncomfortable. Shifted. Mind wandered to dinner. Noticed and came back.

No judgment. No rules. No performance anxiety.

For the first time, it fel...</div>

Then I started chanting with a mala and it was a game changer.  I would chant for 30 or 60 minutes. It calmed my mind and made it easy to follow my breath.
Now I'm hooked on meditation.  It's as important as eating and sleeping. I wouldn't consider going a day without meditating at least 2 or 3 times.</div>

I used to own a VFX studio and this is how all the artist connected to the remote workstations. Over 100 ms would be too much latency for us though. We found that artist had some bad experiences past 80 ms.

Edit: Layer 2 direct connection.</div>

So while I'm also not sure what is new, it's still interesting to think about in terms of the singularity.</div>

Sounds like an enjoyable but forgettable 2010's era indie band that had a couple of hits but could never really keep up the momentum. They still release mostly unheard music to the pleasure of a meager few die-hard fans, but are mostly relegated to nostalgia-heavy road trip playlists for mid-to-late 20-somethings.</div>

For the uninitiated: Toyota Industries is essentially the original company from which Toyota Motors was spun off, and makes things like looms, forklifts, industrial machinery, engines, and even some cars for Toyota Motors. They're basically the same company and have always operated that way, it's just through an odd twist of history that they never formally merged. Toyota is fixing that now.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There are three relevant entities here — Toyota Group, Toyota Motors, and Toyota Industries:

**Toyota Group** is a Keiretsu, meaning a collection of different companies which operate in alignment — think of a flock of birds or a school of fish all going in the same direction. One does steel, one does glass, one does strategic investment, one does marine shipping.. but they all co-operate to achieve same-results. 

**Toyota Motors** is one of those group companies and the one that makes cars. That's the Toyota you probably think of when you think 'Toyota'.

**Toyota Industries** is another company in the group, and makes parts of cars (engines, doors, dashboards) and a bunch of industrial things to support the making of cars — robots, forklifts, looms, metal stamping machines. A significant portion of this goes to Toyota Motors, but a lot of it goes to other companies too. You can [buy a Toyota Industries Forklift yourself](https://www.toyotaforklift.com/).

Toyota Motors is now buying Toyota Industries, and that's about it. Toyota Group is still Toyota Group, Toyota Motors is just absorbing Toyota Industries, which previously operated like a separate company *because it was* technically a separate company.</div>

In one test, an FP16 matrix multiplication kernel only hit 52 percent of PyTorch's speed. Things looked even worse for Flash Attention, a memory-intensive technique used in large language models, where the AI-generated kernel crawled along at just 9 percent of PyTorch's pace.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">nvidia's neural textures are a really interesting look at using ML for media compression and reconstruction. it's part of a broader family of techniques that includes dlss and rtx video upscaling - all different implementations of the same core concept, just optimized for different use cases.

dlss upscales lower resolution game rendering in real-time, and rtx video enhances compressed footage during playback. both use ai to reconstruct detail that was never there originally.

so the idea of ai filling in missing information to create better looking content (from content that had a smaller original storage/computational cost) is already happening. it's not exactly the same as traditional codecs of course, but we're definitely seeing early versions of what you're talking about.</div>

However, many hotel fitness centers are equipped with newer water coolers which not only chill the water, but filter it as well. Fill up a water bottle there instead of paying! </div>

Creative minds are still needed even if physical labor goes out the window (actors, set builders, camera operators etc.). 


I've seen way too many cringe worthy things generated by people on these subs to believe idea people and writers are going to be out of the job. They're going to be more important than ever. At least until the AI can come up with good concepts stories on its own without any promoting needed beyond "hey make a sentimental ad for this product that tugs people's heart strings" and it spits out a Spielberg movie. Which I'm assuming will happen eventually but definitely not today. </div>

I'll never understand people that scream "I CAN TELL ITS AI", good for you missing the larger picture.

In 2018 our past selfs would not have believed this was 100% generated by a computer and would have been considered magic. Thats how fast things are changing.</div>

Make them about something orthogonal to the topic - use it as a tool and not as inspiration, and use videogen models to create non-obvious camera shots that would be really expensive with normal technology, and see how well it does on the real market - my bet is that you're unlikely to hit 1M views or have many fans.</div>

I mean, from a technical side it's more than incredible, to be able to achieve this just from a set of instructions and nothing else. But the outputs are just bland, like corporate-training or stock video bland. Something designed to be almost white noise-ish.

It tracks because the largest part of what humanity produces artistically \_is\_ bland. Only the 99.99th percentile can be considered good or to have some sort of incredible artistic merit beyond being white noise.</div>

I also remember being a middle school kid super into games when the Wii got announced. Me and my friends were so hyped and fantasizing about how motion control would revolutionize gaming.  “It’ll be like real sword fights. It’s gonna be amazing!”

That being said, there is more reason to think that it will keep accelerating instead of plateuing.

2 big reasons:

1. Companies and states have an actual interest in having the best AI possible to be more competitive (unlike the wii motion controllers only a very small and niche part of population even cared as a hobby). 
2. Ai getting better makes it possible to improve AI even further each time (untill you reach the name of this sub)</div>

The second point is also true but AI developing AI will inevitably introduce problems and glitches. There are already studies that show that AI fed with generated data sets leeds to worse results.

AI generated content is just beginning to dominate our media and culture and therefore will definately feed back into AI models.</div>

Correct. Yet many on this sub hiss and froth at the mouth if anyone even slightly suggests AI might not rid this entire solar system of its jobs in the next 5 minutes.

And,

1) Companies and states may have an actual interest but at the end of the day, money speaks. If they aren't generating enough returns to satisfy their input, then it's a bust, no matter how much interest there is in it from the producer side. And ofcourse, it's a complicated equation of energy input/costs, customer demand, etc. Many are making a calculated risk, and this may or may not pay off in the long run.

2) How? AI getting better means it's MORE difficult to improve it in a significant way, at least with the current pathway we are taking. We are nowhere near that "recursive improvement" sort of scenario. That's probably an entirely different paradigm of AI than LLMs. Also, we are making minor improvements every day. Major/revolutionary improvements, much like what Deepseek did, are few and far in between. And that makes sense. The more complicated something becomes, the more there is for humans to learn, thus the low hanging fruits are picked clean, and more time is needed to come up with something revolutionary the deeper you burrow in the domain of AI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The dotcom bubble was similar. However I don't think there will be a massive crash like back then, because the main driver of that crash were early internet startups that went bankrupt and now it's some of the biggest companies that have ever existed investing money they had saved over a decade. Even if the investments of Google, Microsoft, Meta, etc end up being a huge bust, they can afford the loss without an issue, so this time there is at least as much upside but not the same risk as with the dotcom bubble.</div>

I know this one in particular is just a coincidence - but I find it really interesting to see if human ingenuity could have conjured up ideas of the inventions we currently use before it was ever invented - much like sci-fi has conjured up eerily similar situations that we are facing right now with the rise of AI.

10x better but 100x more expensive is not a good deal. And odds are they're like 3x better at best; let alone 100x better.

Sure, if you're already very wealthy, go for it. But if you're not, the trade-offs don't seem to make sense for me.</div>
