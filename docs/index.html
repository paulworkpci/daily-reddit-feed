ive been on and off in nosurf but for the year 2024, i decided to try out instagram.

there are a few good things that came out of instagram, i socialized more with coworkers and reached out with friends from highschool, i even made friends at the gym. it was like a common space; a third place on the internet where we all see what other people are up to. and i even got to share my hobbies, gym, dance clas...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You're not the only one. Alot of people who aren't even "influencers" feel the pressure to curate a version of themselves on social media that isn't accurate of who they are in real life. 

I've done it before, and it's emotionally draining, and it feels like you're putting on this fake act and doing a metaphorical "song and dance". 

You're living your life in the moment, and you recognize that it doesn't have to be captured by social media in order to be "valid". I think that there is a certain validation that comes from posting on social media. As in, the confirmation that you in fact *exist*. Just keep reminding yourself you don't need to post on social media to prove that you are living a fullfilling life.</div>

But no.  One of them dies within the first day during a fumbled attempt to hostily take over/rejoin the main group, killing the other to show allegiance to in-group....however, just their disloyalty is observed and they are banished to the other side of the island again where they are seen circling the outskirts of the main camp for a few days like smeagol before starving to death 4 days later, in a beached alcove, dehydrated from drinking salt water, licking moss off rocks as the waves slowly splash them more and more as the tide rises.

                        <div class="comment-body">Just gonna take the bait, why is popularity so important here? 

Isn't the larger point just media literacy? That Joe Rogan's podcast and journalism shouldn't be viewed as the same thing? 

If someone made a comment in 1964 that the Beatles were more popular than Walter Cronkite so journalists could all suck it, wouldn't that be weird comparison?

Obviously there's more crossover with Rogan and information reporting these days, but shouldn't we still be able to distinguish entertainment from profession? And especially when that's the bailey used for every criticism of the crossover, "well he's just a podcaster, bro talking about weed and aliens and shit" until we want to compare him to professional journalists, then it's look at the audience?</div>

Is he just a silly guy or is he the most influential media figure in the country that dwarfs CNN and FOX news in viewership as well as being a must attend for presidential candidates?

When he endorsed RFK Matt Walsh basically said he was their prised useful idiot but now they're saying he's just a silly guy in a costume.</div>

At first, I thought, *“This isn’t enough to make a difference.”* But over time, those little wins started stacking up. Each one gave me the confidence to take on the next. Before I knew it, I was hitting milestones I never thought possible.

To me, that was a realistic take on ASI and it's potential.

A major plot hole was that the ASI didn't have good social skills. A true ASI will comprehend every paper and book ever written on psychology, sociology, etc as well as discover vast amounts of new knowledge too.</div>

Also I hope just like the movie, when ASI comes out ASI can cure all mental health issues, cancers, neurological disorders and more. I got to watch this movie btw. I agree with others limitless was another great movie which I really liked a lot.</div>

Also every movie is ambiguous so as to not really be concrete as to the whole picture which lets people run wild with theories, which leads to more engagement and clicks, and then you are in the rabbit hole all over again trying to climb your way out.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I cut my screen time down from 20 hours a day, to 2 1/2 which I'm comfortable with. But since then, I've been bored a lot more, and I've been telling myself to just accept being bored until I come up with something. Sometimes I just sit there and think in silence. 
I have picked up reading, the current book I'm on talks about how your partner has no responsibility over your wellbeing, and that if something they do/says triggers your sense of security, you need to know how to keep inner peace and not let it affect you. I'm very heavily influenced by my partner, so this book is very mindblowing to me about needing to be independent -as a team.

So I say that stopping social media and being on my phone in general, I've come to learn a lot more than I bargained for. My critical thinking skills are stronger, I'm reading more, I'm being creative with the activities, my focus is more effective.

                        <div class="comment-body">It’s going to sound strange but try exercise. We think that exercise takes our energy but being active will actually give you more energy. You can start slow, just 10 minutes a day doing anything you wish as long as you’re moving. It’ll make a big difference. 

I also recommend trying to sleep more. Maybe you need 8-9 hours, not 7. Go to bed earlier if you can. 

Are you extremely stressed? That can make you feel tired all the time as your rest may not even be productive rest. Exercise will help with that too, as will meditation and/yoga. I like the Headspace app. Just a few minutes a day will help you control anxious thoughts much better. 

Lastly, it seems like you got checked out already, but if it continues, see a doctor again. I don’t want to scare you but I had cancer in my 20s and my only symptom before I found the lump was that I started sleeping all the time and became really lethargic. It’s very unlikely that’s what’s happening to you, but make sure you’re going to regular appointments and tell your doctors if cancer runs in your family so you can get extra screening. 

Take care of yourself!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I was in a similar situation, always feeling tired and sleepy. I did a blood test and found out I had vitamin deficiencies (like D, B12, and a few others). After about 2 weeks of taking what the doctor prescribed, I felt way better. I’m a web developer working 10–13 hours a day, so I was super curious to figure this out, and luckily I found the solution. Maybe get a blood test too?</div>

Happy New Year! I think this is a great way to start 😊 One of our readers from Poland, who spent New Year’s Eve in the Canary Islands, specifically in Playa Blanca, Lanzarote, observed an unusual black, spherical object today (01.01.2025 at 11:00 AM) while relaxing by the pool.

At the beginning of the recording, the witness can be heard having a conversation. The woman asks, "What is that?" to which she receives the response, "I have no f\*\*\*ing idea."

The witness admitted that it was difficult to determine whether it was a balloon, as the windy weather should have affected its movement, but the object moved too smoothly and freely. According to the witness, the object appeared larger than it seems in the recording, which was made using an iPhone 15.

A total of four recordings were made within an hour, as the object either returned into view or there were multiple similar objects. The black color of the object contrasted well against the white clouds, but it became much harder to spot when it moved against the blue sky.

As always with my posts, I’m leaving the original recordings straight from the phone for your own analysis. Best regards, and once again, I wish you all the best and as much success as possible. May 2025 bring more answers than questions!

                                <div class="reply-body">I have seen one of these here in Texas back in 2023. They look like a perfectly spherical metal ball, basically, a shiny ball bearing. I saw it from about 100ft away directly under the flight path of a major airport. It was also very close to a power substation.

It was going against the wind and was not a balloon. 

If /u/[paranormalnapolska](https://www.reddit.com/user/paranormalnapolska/) can drop an exact location and the direction they were facing I can see if it was going with or against the wind. The weather in [Lanzarote](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lanzarote/@29.0243093,-13.6470443,18376m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0xc4623cd1ca2398b:0xa2a0d68ac57b1518!8m2!3d29.0468535!4d-13.5899733!16zL20vMDFzOHdt?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) shows the wind as being 8mph WSW.</div>

We don't have high quality footage of UFOs because the footage being high quality reveals it to be known phenomenon like a balloon or a drone

We only have shaky, blurry night footage because it obscures the object enough that we can't tell what it is</div>

Don’t get me wrong, saying AI will never get good is ridiculous. But it’s a fact that 99% of people today have no use for it its current state, makes sense for them to make fun of it.

And even once AI gets useful enough for them, it would take years to fully integrate into their lives. People thinking AGI would change the lives of everyone in one day doesn’t understand how the world works.</div>

Like isn’t odd the Super Bowl is going to be there.  Terrorist (isis) don’t even know wtf Super Bowl is, you gotta dumb to believe that and the fact that they made the terrorist look like a military vet bc they want us to have an enemy within our own people.  - JUST A CONSPIRACY …..but yeah 2025 going to be interesting script!

UPDATE: If you go on google, search up 2002 Super Bowl tell me what location it was at. Then think about the events that occurred the year before…… it’s kinda repeating itself.</div>

I don't know if this video has been posted here before, I don't see it around, I don't think it's that popular.


"On September 24, 2016, a spherical object was filmed by the South Wales police helicopter in the United Kingdom while officers were flying at 1,000 feet (approximately 305 meters) above the Bristol Channel. The police, confused, stated that the mysterious craft was flying against the wind and was not detected by air traffic control at around 9:30 PM. The object – which could not be seen with the naked eye – was captured by thermal cameras."

We assumed it was a chinese lantern at first as it seemed to just be floating. Until it suddenly zig-zagged across what must have been 50-70 miles, left to right, before shooting off in the opposite direction almost instantaneously. Both me and my dad think about this quite a lot.</div>

We stopped the car and got out but this was just as touchscreen phones were first coming out and no one really had the best of cameras and we wasn’t exactly wealthy at the time. The thing floated there for about 30 seconds before literally just going straight up and disappearing within a second. It was crazy but thanks to that I’ve been a believer pretty much my whole life. Wasn’t just us who saw it either. This thing in the video looks similar but I’ll never forget how bright it was</div>

Their entire career that was viable a couple years ago is now going to be 10x harder and people are celebrating it. I'm no artist, but one thing I know that's universal is that the feeling of the noose tightening makes anyone lash out, and I'd expect more AI communities to recognize it but the hype is blinding.</div>

It's fascinating, and I keep thinking how much the increasing resistance mirrors the attitudes before Kasparov played Deep Blue and Lee Sedol played Alpha Go.

Of course, generally, moderate, nuanced views don't garner clicks -- so from a karma farming perspective, extreme positions tend to have more appeal.

This guy found a listing in Texas with a matching truck that had the same dealer sticker on the tailgate. 

He contacted Turo and they asked him to take the link to the listing down.

Of course they did not do formal complexity analysis, but that was also far more efficient than O(n\^2) when the data was approximately evenly distributed.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The earliest description of the Bubble sort algorithm was in a 1956 paper by mathematician and actuary Edward Harry Friend,[4] Sorting on electronic computer systems,[5] published in the third issue of the third volume of the Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), as a "Sorting exchange algorithm". Friend described the fundamentals of the algorithm, and, although initially his paper went unnoticed, some years later, it was rediscovered by many computer scientists, including Kenneth E. Iverson who coined its current name.

Funny enough, if transformer models turn out to be capable of innovation (oai level 4), then they will likely play a key role in making themselves much less expensive.</div>

When I moved bi-weekly there were always 2 months where i would get 3 paychecks. By keeping my budget based on bi-monthly, those two months's would be "extra" paychecks for whatever I need. Maybe it was catching up after a heavier month of spending, unexpected expenses, or to save for a rainy day or vacation.

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree with this. Trying to build something with OpenAI Realtime API and Gemini 2.0 Flash and I'm seeing:

1. The cost isn't feasible for mass adoption. It can work as a premium service but people aren't going to pay a premium price for it.  (Look at people complaining about Claude/ChatGPT etc not being worth it when you have AI Studio or OpenWebUI).
2. Most frameworks / tools aren't ready. I've been working with Langgraph and a few other tools and they are still not ready to support these new capabilities (real time chat + vision models).
3. Reliability (not until we have these Multi-Model AI systems hooked up to "thinking" models will agent really make sense. The speech/video inputs as modalities will help the UX (no-one really wants to type), while thinking will make these agents work close to 100% of the time (hopefully).
4. Probably Inference capacity (Sonnet :( ... )
5. New business models need to solve the problem of monetization.

  
While listening to Deepmind's podcast about Project Astra their research lead talked about two-way communication, advance voice capabilities (ability for the model to understand different voices, and make out the user even in crowded and noisy environments are real roadblocks to creating products that work in the real world and promote adoption.</div>

Nobody even has a vision for a product that most people will pay more than pocket change for. 

Sure it's cool, but end of the day it's got to be better than gamepass to be that widespread.

They'll might say things like: AI's code doesn't reach 100% success rate expectation (whether for code correctness, speed, etc).

I rely on AI coding heavily and my expectations sky high, but I get good results and I'd like to share how / why:

At that point you don't need to know what it's doing , just tell it what to do.
Add multimodality to that and I think a solo dev will be able to do a small companies worth of work alone and not know a line of code.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A lot of the dismissiveness I see among programmers is because using AI really does slow you down a lot when you first try to integrate it into your work, but that's true of any tool.

If you endure the initial pain, you quickly get a sense of what it can help you with and what it can't, and then it becomes very useful.  Eventually, you start to optimize your workflow around it - you change the way you break down problems to maximise the number of subtasks that can be reliably offloaded to a model.  That ends up being &gt;75% of the code.

It also tends to be better than me at those subtasks and teaches me new things, and I'm very far from a beginner.  One of the problems with being experienced is that you tend to solve common problems the same way you did a decade ago, and don't really notice the language or library added a better way since then.

There are countless times where I asked a model to solve a problem and I have a pretty clear idea of what I expect the solution to look like (ie, how I'd solve it), and it generates something much better.</div>

Yeah you can get the LLMs to write unit tests from descriptions but they actually go the other way more reliably, for now the tests I've done all had manual target unit tests and the only real metric I've been considering is time.

But yeah 100% moving forward as you scale this up and balance more kinds of resources having the LLM's take over the meta task is gotta be the next obvious priority.
