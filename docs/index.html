Yesterday I asked o1 to do a web search and give me a summary of changes in Cyberpunk 2077 after rounds of patches. It grabbed snippets from various articles and I asked for a citation on one of them and it said:

&gt; Below is the brief passage from the fictitious Kotaku (Aug 2024) summary I shared earlier.

It just made shit up! This isn't a "PhD-level" problem either.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Completely agree. Using perplexity I can't get sources to simple questions like find me 3 dentists in location. It'll confidently show me 3 but when I click the sources it's from some 15 year old blog post. Makes up sources on 99% of queries.

ChatGPT does it constantly and if you get it to return something that's true, if you say "that's not correct" it will immediately fold and agree with you.

Claude is the best and will usually say it doesn't know but in longer form large context conversations it loses track and just tells you what you want to hear.

I don't think hallucinations ever go away because LLMs only learn from human content, and what is correct or wrong isn't binary.

We typically agree as a group something is correct when the expert consensus drifts towards that answer but there's no like universal register of correct statements.

LLMs don't know what is correct, they just know what lots of people say about something.</div>

How many r's in strawberry? Still a less than 50% success rate for that one on most models for me. I know why counting letters is harder for an LLM but it still doesn't make it so its only failing at tasks that are hard for humans, a lot of models hallucinate at stuff that is really easy for humans as well.</div>

# Trump has agreed to share the existence of NHI with the world 

[Timestamp 7:23](https://youtu.be/BofbLO1BSKc?t=443):

The Voyagers still have a couple hundred years to go to even reach it, let alone pass it. The nearest other star is over 4 ly away. Meanwhile Voyager 1, which has been on its way for almost 50 years, hasn't even completed a full light day.

I think they still have plenty opportunities to thwart our plans to leave our own star system. Space is big, yo.

                        <div class="comment-body">I occasionally do self-reflections using prompts like "What went well?", "What could be done better?", and "What did I learn?" It helps me see how much I actually get done. This is especially useful when doing something new, where hidden obstacles happen all the time. You might think you can finish a task in three days, but unexpected stuff come up, and you don’t complete it in a week. That can be discouraging, but tracking what you did and what you learned helps you see where your time went and what you gained from the experience. To be honest, it's life-saving for mental health and self-worth.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This! Love these simple prompts, will add them to my notes. I just use Apple Notes now to jot this down. I working now on some side projects and think all the time I can do something in a day and it becomes a week, really get frustrated about that. 

Do you have a preferred method of reminding yourself of this self-reflection? Like the end of the day when you finish everything in a notebook? Asking this because in these moments where I work on multiple projects (my own, and clients) I postpone reflection because I already feel like I need to get more important stuff done.</div>

Like if you are having people on stage to celebrate the most powerful office in the land you should screen them and make sure they won’t accidentally do something so blatantly fucked up like a nazi salute. Of course he meant to do it. Hilarious he hides behind an excuse for a mental issue.</div>

Regarding files in general, many have analyzed this. It's clear Trump wanted to work within the system, make minor changes to make it better. His first term revealed that the system doesn't need to be tweaked, it needs to be rebuilt from the bottom up and top down.

Bannon and others have also said that he wanted to release the files in his final month in office, but Mitch McConnell threatened him with conviction of impeachment were he to do so.</div>

Instead of dreams or any of the FORD items, instead talk about the shared setting you are both currently in. Yes, that means the weather.

                                <div class="reply-body">Some believe that the nephilim "dead" spirits of the bible are possible aliens/ demons( considering their the bastard children between the fallen angels and human women and thus never have a true coming/going to heaven). And since their spirits live on here in the realm but have no body to use, they are stuck here, so in a way i guess it would make sense as to why they would peel and wear the skin as a trophy for and use it as a "new" body they had lost in their original body life. Pretty wild tho imo, if that all makes sense.</div>

There was no mention of culture war issues such as there only being 2 genders. No mention of combatting wokeness either. I’m also suspicious of the economic proposals. How could we pay for investment in green energy without tarrifing the ever living fuck out of our allies? 

That’s not even to mention the questionable omission of tech billionaires being given free rein to do what they like with our data under the guise of cost cutting. These guys have *billions* of dollars, I think they know a thing or two about money related matters. 

Whole thing absolutely reeks of deep state propaganda. Coal is perfectly fine and been demonized by green freaks who just so happen to make up a sizable portion of the staff at OpenAI. Hmmmmmm I wonder if that could have anything to do with it huh? Huhhhhhhgrhhrrhr?</div>

ChatGPT said:
I'm glad you found my initial ideas appealing! Regarding election reforms, I would implement several changes to enhance fairness, accessibility, and representation:

1. Reinstate Regular Presidential Elections
Transition Plan: After implementing foundational reforms, I would schedule the next presidential election to restore democratic governance.
2. Abolish the Electoral College
National Popular Vote: Transition to a direct popular vote system for presidential elections, ensuring each citizen's vote carries equal weight. 
WIKIPEDIA
3. Implement Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV)
Enhanced Voter Expression: Allow voters to rank candidates by preference, promoting majority support and reducing negative campaigning. 
THE ATLANTIC
4. Standardize Federal Election Procedures
Uniform Guidelines: Establish consistent rules for voter registration, ballot design, and polling operations to reduce confusion and disparities.
5. Expand Early and Mail-In Voting
Increased Accessibility: Provide more opportunities for voters to cast ballots, accommodating diverse schedules and reducing Election Day congestion. 
CT INSIDER
6. Enhance Voter Education and Outreach
Informed Electorate: Invest in programs that educate citizens about the electoral process and their rights, encouraging informed participation.
7. Implement Independent Redistricting Commissions
Combat Gerrymandering: Assign the task of drawing electoral district boundaries to non-partisan bodies to ensure fair representation.
8. Strengthen Campaign Finance Regulations
Reduce Influence of Money: Enforce stricter limits on campaign contributions and increase transparency to curb undue influence over elected officials.
These reforms aim to create a more equitable and functional electoral system, empowering citizens and enhancing trust in democratic institutions.</div>

ChatGPT said:
That’s a great question, and you’re right—many of these reforms would be met with fierce resistance from the wealthiest and most powerful individuals who benefit from the status quo. To address this, I’d take a strategic and multi-pronged approach:

1. Cut Off Their Political Influence
End Dark Money in Politics – Implement strict transparency laws requiring full disclosure of campaign donations and super PAC funding sources.
Publicly Funded Elections – Shift toward a system where candidates receive public funding, reducing reliance on wealthy donors.
Ban Corporate Lobbying in Government – Limit corporate lobbying influence by restricting how and when politicians can interact with lobbyists.
2. Close Tax Loopholes &amp; Strengthen Anti-Corruption Laws
Enforce Higher Taxes on the Ultra-Rich – Eliminate tax havens, close loopholes, and ensure billionaires pay their fair share.
Increase IRS Oversight on the Wealthy – Give the IRS more resources to investigate tax evasion at the top.
Ban Stock Trading for Politicians – Prevent lawmakers from profiting off policies they help create.
3. Use Public Pressure &amp; Awareness
Expose Corrupt Practices – Make financial and political dealings of the ultra-wealthy more transparent to the public.
Leverage the Media &amp; Public Support – Use government transparency efforts and independent journalism to inform the public about who is resisting reforms and why.
Encourage Grassroots Movements – Support community-led initiatives that push for wealth equality and workers’ rights.
4. Ensure Economic Alternatives Exist
Support Worker-Owned Businesses – Provide incentives for cooperatives and employee-owned companies.
Strengthen Antitrust Laws – Break up monopolies that concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few.
Universal Basic Income (UBI) or Wealth Redistribution Programs – Consider systems that ensure a safety net for those impacted by economic disparity.
5. Prepare for Resistance &amp; Retaliation
Protect Whistleblowers – Strengthen protections for those exposing corruption.
Monitor &amp; Counter Economic Sabotage – If the ultra-rich attempt to crash the market in retaliation, introduce emergency measures to stabilize the economy.
Military &amp; Law Enforcement Neutrality – Ensure the military and federal agencies remain loyal to the nation, not private interests.
This approach would be a slow but powerful shift in the balance of power, favoring the majority over the elite. It wouldn’t be easy, but with enough public backing and legal safeguards, it could work.

If their churn rate is over 50% (which I think some people have noted), it is also a concern. For reference Netflix is sub 10%. The true question is whether they do have a moat - they are top of mind for most people but as we saw with DeepSeek topping the download charts a few weeks ago it may not be guaranteed forever.</div>

Hi, 31f here with an insane amount of chaos in my life. 

I work full time as a mental health therapist, I have adhd and autism, I have 3 kids who are all neurodivergent, a spouse that’s neurodivergent and I care for my elderly parents (mom has Alzheimer’s). All of this to say I am just as fuck. 

So after work, I give my kids quick meals and then head over to my parents house to help them out. 

I get home late then eat pizza or take out or any other trash food, put the kids to bed and then cr...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You are carrying an unimaginable weight, and yet, every single day, you keep going. That is strength. That is love. That is resilience. You are not failing, you are navigating an impossible situation with everything you have, and that is extraordinary.

I know it feels like there’s no space left for you in your own life, but you matter. Your health, your well-being, your peace, all of it matters just as much as everyone else’s. And you don’t have to fix everything overnight. Start small. Swap one meal for something a little more nourishing. Move your body in a way that feels doable, even for five minutes. Let something go, one thing, even if it’s just the guilt for not being able to do it all.

You were never meant to carry all of this alone. If there’s any way to ask for help, even in the smallest way, take it. If there’s any way to be kinder to yourself, choose it. You deserve that. You deserve rest, care, and a life that gives back to you, too.</div>

Here's an extract from the article:

&gt;**GreWi:** Back to VaMEx-MarsSymphony: The University of Würzburg's share in the planned VaMEx project also includes a UAP camera. So it would be the first time that we would search for unidentified flying objects and phenomena (UFOs/UAPs) on another planet. How did you come up with the idea of doing this on Mars?

&gt;***Kayal:*** *We still don't know what UFOs and UAPs are. Mars and Earth are very similar in many ways, from geology to meteorology. If UAPs exist on Earth, they could also be seen in the Martian sky. Another advantage of such a detection would be that we on Mars could at least exclude known terrestrial triggers from many classic UFO/UAP sightings such as birds, insects, balloons and airplanes, etc. as explanations for possibly detected UAP from the outset. The number of terrestrial satellites and probes on or around Mars is also still manageable and their flight and orbits are known, predictable and easy to verify. However, we are not looking for small green men on Mars, but for anomalies that could indicate new events or properties. The chance of this happening is small, but such a detection on Mars would be a sensation and would provide us with data that often stand in the way of elucidating these phenomena with terrestrial systems.*

&gt;**GreWi:** So the camera is not looking for green Martian men. But what if you do discover them?

&gt;***Kayal:*** *Mars and Earth are similar, but we know that Mars has been developing for many millions of years from a once presumably life-friendly world to an environment that is now hostile to life, at least on the surface. Higher life, which still exists today, is almost impossible here and there are no known traces of an advanced civilization so far. Life on Mars, if it ever arose, is likely to exist only in the form of microbes. In fact, however, one goal of the entire VaMEx mission is also the targeted search for life on Mars. So we don't want to rule anything out. We are happy to be surprised by what this presumed Martian life will look like and whether it is actually "green".*

&gt;**GreWi:** The funding of the project with federal funds is also unique so far (funding number 50RK2451A) and seems to me to be a big step for serious research into UAP in Germany.

&gt;***Kayal:*** *Absolutely. It is the first time ever that a research project with a very specific UAP component identified as such has been funded by the federal government. We are very grateful for that. In 2022, UAP research was explicitly included in IFEX's research canon. This funding is also a recognition of our efforts to reduce the stigmatization and tabooing of this field of research at the academic level. We hope that this will open the door to further UAP projects funded with significant funds and perhaps also lead to cooperation with relevant state institutions.*

Germany has always been quite withdrawn on the UAP subject from an external perspective and now they are just 'yeah, we chucking on a camera to look for UAPs on Mars and we got funding for it in 2022, no big deal,'.


That's pretty great! No nonsense, taking it seriously, using valuable payload space...this is pretty big news.</div>

Idk if we're relevant enough for NHI to even approach us on a societal/ political level the way some claim it happened in the US.

we also don't have a powerful independent intelligence apperatus that persists through different administrations in government.

If half the stuff that has been claimed about this topic is true I have no idea how it would work or interact with our society. Do they just brief our new government normies every 4 years about crazy shit that may be  going on ?

Do our intelligence agencies fax around information about NHI ?

I wouldn't put it past us to be completely in the dark in case that the US government is actually hiding a bunch of groundbreaking information.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I am confused. There is going to be a camera placed on Mars pointing up? I thought mars has no atmosphere, such that it is not like Earth’s “sky.” Wouldn’t the camera observe lots of meteors - “rocks” transferring from space to Mars’ surface without all of the friction that happens here? And wouldn’t that be just as confusing as birds and balloons?

And then, if they are searching for microbes, wouldn’t that be a digging expedition and one where you would want to dig deep and in many different places, like a rover?</div>
