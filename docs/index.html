                <div class="post-content">In my understanding, meditation is a practice that helps build inner strength to control the mind and aim it deliberately toward a situation or problem.

The mind is like a trash bin — it keeps collecting more trash every day, trying to make sense of the new trash based on the old trash.

Meditation is a way to witness all this junk, clean it up a bit, and maybe let less trash come in each day.

But here’s what I’m stuck on:

                        <div class="comment-body">Sure, meditation can be a coping mechanism that keeps you complacent with your current situation.

If you are able to and want to change your external environment, do so. If you are not, meditation can be a coping mechanism that can help you until you are able to do so.

But certainly, one could fall into the habit of not and just coping, as many do with substances

Meditation, just like any other tool falls in line with your intention. If you’re in a toxic situation and looking to get out, meditation can help you cultivate your inner strength till you can work your way out. But if you intend to stay, don’t want to leave, or can’t leave, meditation can become a coping mechanism.

Intention.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agree with this but will also like to add that external environments thats consider toxic to you usually involves multiple circumstances that tend to build up if they are things completely out of your control (people,work environments, society) meditation will only do so much. It will almost become a necessity that loses its full potential of what it’s really supposed to do for you. It will gradually take the edge off for so long and short term.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think it depends on how you use meditation.

If you just use it to feel a little better but stay stuck in the same mess, then yeah — it’s basically a band-aid. It gives short-term relief but doesn’t fix anything.

But if you stick with it and really pay attention, meditation starts to clear your head. It helps you see what’s actually going on — both inside you and around you. And when you see clearly, you start making better decisions. You stop getting pulled into the same junk over and over.

So at first, meditation might just help you survive the day. But if you keep at it, it gives you the strength and clarity to change your life — not just tolerate it.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Meditation is not about numbing, distracting, tolerating, or even feeling better. Inner peace and equanimity may be outcomes but is not necessarily the point. Meditation is a practice of increasing awareness to see reality as it "is", without all of the stories you attach to it. When you see things as they are, then you can take the best possible action grounded in the present moment rather than reacting with conditioned patterns. In any situation that brings dissatisfaction, you have only 3 choices: leave it, change it, accept it. If you do nothing, you continue to suffer. Many people do nothing because they don't even have the awareness of the situation in the first place.</div>

and the special thing is that it's not retarded like open AI model and actually cheap to run like so fucking cheap

not only is it better than the closed source model in some aspects, it's also dominating in every other way what a time to be alive Now whenever they release the paper, OpenAI can actually LEARN something about how to make efficient effective models

I would be surprised if motherfuckers at OpenAI managed to get an open source model out that is better than the the QAM, whatever OpenAI is doing is just a marketing scam those fuckers know it</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Summary by me

* **8 Main models** released under the Apache 2.0 license:
   * MoE: Qwen3-235B-A22B, Qwen3-30B-A3B
   * Dense: Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-14B, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-1.7B, and Qwen3-0.6B as well as the base models for all those
* **Hybrid Thinking**: selectable thinking and non-thinking modes, controllable turn-by-turn using /think and /no\_think commands in the chat, just like that. Thinking budget can also be adjusted manually.
* **Expanded Multilingual Support**: Increased support to 119 languages and dialects.
* **Pre-training**: Pre-trained on nearly 36 trillion tokens. Consists of 3 stages: S1 30T tokens for basic language understanding, S2 for reasoning tasks 5T tokens and S3 for long context.
* **New Post-training Pipeline**: Implemented a four-stage pipeline S1 long CoT cold start, S2 reasoning RL, S3 thinking mode fusion, S4 general RL.
* **Availability**: Models accessible via Qwen Chat (Web\[https://chat.qwen.ai/ \]/ Mobile) free unlimited usage, and Hugging Face to download and run on all major open source platforms (vLLM, Ollama, LMStudio, etc.)</div>

If i ask for code that can be found in its knowledge base or can be easily pieced together from different related codes, o4-mini-high can produce very nice solution. However if what i want is entirely new and must be coded from scratch, it quite often produces sub-optimal code, use deprecated API or raises wrong exceptions.

Full o3 is great, but message limitation is stupid and it's frustrating. I'm now mostly using Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok for my codes, 2.5 Pro has an edge here.</div>

also annoys me to no end that even if you pay for chatgpt you still can only use it in a very limited way before it says "oops have to wait 3 weeks to use this feature again" .. and it so effin slow nowadays too</div>

I'm sure this will be like most of those cars though where it's only ever leased, and actual purchases are rare.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Really starting to believe the main reason they depreciate is people can't stop fucking prognosticating they will depreciate every time something is posted about EVs. There's no logical reason for it. They're longer lasting more reliable less maintenance less operating costs, and infrastructure is growing along with adoption. Besides the Nissan leaf, nobody has had significant battery degradation... So what's the deal?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’ve driven this car, and while I liked the dynamics a lot, so much of the pricing is the Porsche tax.

It also has an embarrassing interior, a super cramped backseat and very poor luggage space for its class.

My best friend has a BMW iX, and it’s a better car than the Macan 4S in almost every way except looks and costs half as much to lease.

But again, it’s Porsche, so at least 30% of the price goes toward the brand. 

It’s not like my parents’ $80k 2022 Macan S can justify the price either. The interior of that car is worse than a new Hyundai.

Edit: to illustrate how cheap feeling the interior of Porsches are, this is the door panel of a $100k Macan 4S: https://imgur.com/FC3YaLe

Edit 2: this is the cheap center console of the Macan: https://i.imgur.com/eGYn3R4.jpeg Those cup holders would look sad in a Nissan Versa.</div>

The unfortunate part for the Conservatives is that the NDP and the Bloc lost a bunch of seats, particularly the NDP who lost official party status last night.

LMArena is both a really really terrible way to determine which model is 'best' and also actively harmful to LLM development because companies don't seem to realize that, or don't care. Openai and others training models to be good at lmarena are actively making them worse for any real use case.


As a community can we just agree to stop obsessing over the rankings there? It's not an indicator of which model is better in any way shape or form. If the companies are going to game benchmarks at least focus on ones that will also make actual use cases perform better, or at least not worse </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Well OpenAI has a track record of optimizing both for LLM arena and for more meaningful benchmarks in terms of intelligence.

4o is the primary model that a lot of common folks who don’t give a shit about coding/advanced math use. So there’s still value in optimizing it so common people like it.

OpenAI made a mistake with their most recent change being way too sycophantic, but they realized that and are gonna correct it shortly which is good.

Eventually hopefully they’ll give you better customization options on personality.</div>

Now photos are insanely over processed, oversharpened, their blacks are pulled way up and highlights muted so the image is flat, subject segmentation etc -- all because the DXOMark score is higher if there is more """detail""" that's actually just AI scrunching pixels in where there aren't any and making sure no shadows exist ever in all of history.</div>

It replied that I was indeed a genius for asking such a sharp question.

If I’m being honest it’s hard to say which one is better. Sometimes i feel like it’s cursor other times it’s windsurf.

But I think not being able to tell is probably a good thing. Because when I compare windsurf/cursor to things like copilot or Continue(with mistral FIM) it’s obvious right away that cursor/windsurf are better. 

Give it a try, because I’m curious what everyone else thinks too.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I want to put Roo on the right side of the editor, but Windsurf has taken their Cascade agent (which I hate because at some point it started applying edits to code files without requesting a review first, which I do not tolerate) and completely hijacked the user interface with it. In standard VSCode, you can drag the tabs from the primary sidebar on the left to the secondary sidebar on the right, but in Windsurf the only thing you can have on the right side is Cascade.

My hope is that when Microsoft eventually adds support for smart autocomplete with GitHub Copilot, they do it in a way to where Windsurf can go back to being an extension and stop existing as a fork.

The recent wave of VSCode forks has been a blight on the community since each one has questionable stability, a focus only on the features that sell premium subscriptions, and a crippled external marketplace (the last one is 100% Microsoft's fault though).</div>

They would always be behind Github Copilot with that.
