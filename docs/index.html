It helps to start my day without stress. Sometimes I go for a long walk in the forest, just sit there and listen to the birds and the wind in the trees. I feel this really calms down my nervous system.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think you’re right. Unless someone imagines a world of true and unrestrained abundance (ex: I can immediately generate any virtual world I want and have it feel 100% real, which obviously isn’t something that is likely to happen), there will always be greed and desire for more.

Rich people already exist and already still want more. Regular Americans now are anywhere from 20-100x richer than average people from 1,000 years ago and are no less greedy or competitive.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The differences are many. Manufacturing consent also goes for manufacturing a cultures desires, which have been done by business. The people who buy these also do not live in an abundant society. They work hard and probably have low social status and try to impress people. Even the rich tries to impress people. But this is mostly about a corrupt culture.


With true abundance the culture will change and business propaganda disappear. Do you mean that the same people would seriously spend their resources buying skins in a truly abundant society where they are free? It would not be the same.</div>

An example? I made a base class and to it two classes. I needed similar changes in 5 different files to turn the single classes into base classes and one implementation that was already moved into one, and then create the other with values that would match the inverse.

                        <div class="comment-body">The FA-18 mishap is a lot more embarrassing than I think people know. I was in the Navy and served on an aircraft carrier, and the captains of aircraft carriers usually already have close to if not more years of experience as an officer in the fleet. I forget exactly how long it is, but the pipeline to even get the chance to do that is insane. If you successfully captain a carrier you are basically a shoe in to become an admiral at some point. 

Losing one aircraft in the way they did is already very embarrassing, big investigation, lots of eyes on you. Everything around the ship gets very very strict, can’t afford more screw ups, everyone is on their Ps and Qs, that tension disseminates down from the captain to the departments to the divisional officers to the chiefs and everyone in a position of leadership knows, if there is ever a time to NOT eff around, now is that time. 

So, to lose TWO aircraft, and also collide with a merchant vessel, and I think something other major (can’t remember), all during the same deployment period, is absolutely insane. That’s a captain that likely will never see a ship again and has ruined his chance for advancement. Maybe even force retirement, idk. It’s baaaad</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If I'm reading this correctly, every tick costs as much as a current feed-forward run.

So with 100 ticks, you have a model that costs 100 times as much as current transformers and requires ginormous memory.

While the ideas are awesome, their practicability is rather questionable for the time being. But if those issues get a nice, elegant solution, then fasten your seatbelts for the accelerationists and get your goalposts for the luddites. You're going to need them.</div>

&gt; Sakana AI is proud to release the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM), an AI model that uniquely uses the synchronization of neuron activity as its core reasoning mechanism, inspired by biological neural networks. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks, the CTM uses timing information at the neuron level that allows for more complex neural behavior and decision-making processes. This innovation enables the model to “think” through problems step-by-step, making its reasoning process interpretable and human-like. Our research demonstrates improvements in both problem-solving capabilities and efficiency across various tasks. The CTM represents a meaningful step toward bridging the gap between artificial and biological neural networks, potentially unlocking new frontiers in AI capabilities.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">So you know how everything really took off in the public eye around the early 2020s? That's cause in 2018 Google released "Attention is all you need" the paper that introduced transformers. This formula is what enabled chatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Llama and Deepseek to do what they're able to do. 


Since then, scaling has been the paradigm to make these things faster. Giving them more parameters makes them smarter. That said, it's looking like we're hitting diminishing returns on how much that is useful. 


So, we've been waiting for another breakthrough. Something that will impact AI the way Transformers did. This could be it.</div>

Incredible performance by one outstanding athlete! 
I am a bit bummed we won’t be seeing her at the CFG.

Considering she is in an amazing shape, she would have done great at the CFG.
But I respect her decision. She sounded really traumatized.

Her mini interview after she won was amazing. She was really emotional and said she was in a bad shape but she is a lot better.

I hope to see her compete more ❤️</div>

During ownership of both, i noticed some people that drive regular cars would admire these cars and think they're cool.

Though that is true and they are cool, at the end of the day, it was just a car to me.

So those with cool cars (sports cars, super cars, etc.), is it "just a car" to you or is it something more?</div>

It’s like marrying a hot person way out of your league. Drool over them, but remember to look past the beauty and actually enjoy their company, because for most of us, such luck is hard to come by. Can be applied to expensive cars, in my opinion.</div>

Like... what is your point, other than being a shit stirrer? It's not like the two products are easily interchangeable, so what is the point of these constant rants?</div>

Usually I disagree to start nice conversations in which me, someone or maybe everyone might learn something.

Sometimes I do this to expose stupidity or lies. Bashing other people is rarely my goal, if ever, but I definitely love to disagree.</div>

Also, lol if you think they got anywhere close to $20k. It's more like "nothing" and "is written after work hours" for most researcher, and you are already a lucky one if you get payed your training resources, so nothing's stopping you to write that paper you want. An AI model that accurately can analyze hot takes would be pretty cool. I'm waiting.</div>

to date Microsoft still doesn't have its own frontier LLM in the race. many people falsely believe that Microsoft owns 49% of OpenAI, but it's only a profit share and priority access to their models. they have much less influence over OpenAI than people often assume.</div>

&gt; **Can I freeze my reservoir?**

&gt; Yes. You can freeze your reservoir between uses to prevent bacteria growth. For extra hot days on the trail, you can even freeze your reservoir with water in it to ensure you have cold water throughout your ride (or run or hike).</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Lex is one of the most bizarre characters in the Roganverse and general podcast world. He's one of the least charismatic people around and yet his podcast took off almost overnight and he's suddenly interviewing industry titans and world leaders. And despite his lack of charisma, he does have genuinely interesting podcast episodes.


If he'd stayed just interviewing people in industry, it would be an be an unusual case of a podcast becoming famous despite the host, but maybe less questioned. His foray into politics has given him a severe case of main character syndrome where he seems to believe he's on a mission to save the world. And brought along all the controversy that comes with getting political.

Then there's his carefully curated image. I don't think I've ever seen an episode where he doesn't mention the value of free speech, yet even the mildest disagreement gets people blocked on social media. He's always been rumoured to moderate his own reddit sub, which has been gradually whittled down to just episode discussion with critical comments removed. 
He projects his image of peace and love but is quite obviously a social climber, with some of the tidbits that do come out painting him as an altogether different and more petty person</div>

It's because he is actually a good interviewer. He does a good job at letting the guests speak and asks good follow ups. Same reason Joe is popular.</div>

Ever since the whole *boch-up* with that infamous ChatGPT update rollback (the one where users complained it started kissing ass and lost its edge), something *fundamentally* changed. And I don’t mean in a minor “vibe shift” way. I mean it’s like we’re talking to a severely dumbed-down version of GPT, especially when it comes to creative writing or any language other than English.

ChatGPT is still fundamentally, a word prediction engine which has explicit default instructions to be as friendly as possible to the user. Even if it gave you correct code and you said it's wrong it'll be like yes I got it wrong and desperately find a way to give you something different. 

All of this to say, don't take "oh you are correct, I got it wrong in the first place" in the same way a conscious agent reflects on their mistakes</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Very very frustrating.  It got the point that I tell it to tell me the problem before I even test the code.  Sometimes it takes me 3 times before it will say it thinks it’s working. So:

1. I get get code
2. Tell it to review the full code and tell me what errors it has
3. Repeat until it thinks no errors

I gave up on asking why it’s giving me errors it knows it has since it finds it right away without me saying anything.  Like dude just scan it before you give it to me</div>

I thought I was going crazy. I would ask it to help me with something and the answers it would give me would be something ENTIRELY DIFFERENT and off the charts. Info that I've never given it in my life before. But if I ask it if it understands what the task it,then it repeats what my expectations are perfectly. And then starts doing the same thing again. 

So for example, I'll say, "please help me write a case study for a man from America that found out he has diabetes."

Then the reply would be:

"Mr. Jones came from 'Small Town' in South Africa and was diagnosed with Tuberculosis. 

But when I ask, do you understand what I want you do to? It repeats that he's, it's supposed to write a case study about a man in America that was diagnosed with diabetes.</div>

Everything that has shaped our modern world- good, bad, or indifferent- was made by a relatively small group of people.

Ultimately though, we *do* decide what sticks and what doesn’t. **People “voted” yes to the smartphone and “not yet” to google glass. It happens all the time, look at the Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin.**

Currently, people are “voting” overwhelmingly in favor of AI, generally, even if they are not *directly* impacting its trajectory democratically or collaboratively.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I like Kevin Roose a lot, day one listener of Hard Fork, but unfortunately there is a recurring problem in media where reporters insert themselves as ethicists, historians, and systems theorists without any real comprehension of any of these things as discipline. It's essentially dunning kruger ethics. That's not to say he shouldn't be concerned, but his opinion is only marginally more deep than a Thanksgiving dinner family political argument.

These are actually hard concepts that require discipline and study to master and Roose is just a reporter. A talented and smart one with a decent layperson's working knowledge of the field in question, but his limitations show in moments like these when what you witness is low bow populism and his politics on naked display.

Like you stated, this is every invention in history. Roose should know better, and he's smart enough to know better, but I think he's been sucked into the debates on the topic and listened enough to start to have illusions that he understands the problems. He's starting to develop the tunnel vision that is so common around the field.

tl;dr: Roose is smart but this is not his expertise.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Two weeks ago, I shared how I built my iOS game *Word Guess Puzzle* in just 48 hours using pure vibecoding — powered by AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor IDE.

It’s a fun and challenging word association puzzle game where each level makes you go “ahhh, that’s clever!” 😄

I’d genuinely love your thoughts, feedback, or any ideas you have to improve it. Every bit of encouragement helps solo indie devs like me keep going!

Beyond this being an extreme example of Trumps poor decision making, he claims it will become the property of his presidential library after his term is over.


If people were sincere in considering hunter bidens dealings with Ukraine and China as illegal or even national security threats, then they would have been chomping at the bit over chumps crypto scams, his families new, extensive financial deals in the Middle East and they would be asking a thousand questions about which corporations and companies are going to benefit from the Ukraine minerals deal.


This won't happen though, because none of the anti-biden efforts were sincere. They were election propaganda designed to rile up the unthinking class.</div>
