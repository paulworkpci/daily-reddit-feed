But at that time I was mid 30s thinking I was in my 20s and would suffer from injury after injury. Took a couple of years off everything and fell into triathlon. Did well there for a couple of years and covid appears, I fall off the active wagon and now am not doing anything. I want to start back into CrossFit but am fearful of injury and anything else… really fearful of it.

I have always done these things. It's more than 90% of the general population will ever do. And after a year I could run a mile, never done that before. No injuries, feel better, lost weight.

The «injuries» I have had over the years are more of the kind where doing one specific thing or one group of very CrossFit related things hurt so I don’t do them for a while and the injuries go away after a few months. They rarely spill over into my regular life. 

And honestly, compared to my peers at work, having an inflamed biceps tendon for a couple of months or whatever is peanuts compared to the health issues they have. 

It’s not like you are likely to break something or suffer a major injury in any way. Most are overuse injuries, and as the name suggests, you don’t overuse something by only doing it once. There is going to be plenty of warning signs that you have to ignore before you get them. </div>

I'll be 44 in a few days, and currently have a little bit of tendonitis in my knee because I wore my CrossFit shoes to Hyrox class and learned the hard way that I can't run miles and miles in shoes like that anymore. So I'm using my current inability to run as a chance to improve my ski erg times. I'm sure I'll run again before long (in my running shoes this time). It's not the end of the world. This is one of the few injuries I've had and they all go about like this. 


I completely agree that I'd rather have this than what the sedentary people i see around the office have going on. Middle age and older office workers are a mess. I'm glad my only problem is that I can't run for a few weeks. I'll take CrossFit any day. </div>

Older and wiser now in my forties, I started again a few months ago, and between the forced warmups, cardio, and lighter weights than I typically subject myself to I have less aches and pains.

I staunchly refuse to do kipping pull-ups and anything else I might find problematic. My gym’s coaches are all amazing and understanding, and the programming is sensible.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I actually do think AI will be in a bubble, but kind of in similar way dotcom was a bubble. Currently a lot of AI companies and startups are based on something big LLM companies just choose not to do. This works well in other industries, as companies are filling out nishes in the industries, but with LLM's the problem is that you can easily plug it into the main model. Image generation, browsing, IDE integration are all very viable ways to make a AI startup, but at this point they are basically all subsumed by all major LLM's.   
  
I think that is going to happen with majority of AI startups, they will just get replaced by tools developed by large AI tech companies, or just whatever functionality they have will be subsumed by a coding agent working for 15 minutes. This will lead to much larger risk on startup investments, and will likely mean most of that money will flow into the top AI companies, or even possibly just one or two top companies.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">it's such an unprecedented time, nothing makes sense because literally every aspect of the whole global economy is in the process of changing - all the old assumptions are dissolving. The world is actually moving away from oil, robots are going to not only replace a lot of human labor but create whole new ways of doing things - while AI itself is making so many crazy changes, not just ai replacing report writing and phone answering but the big ones doing materials discovery, medicine, ultra-complex design. One new chemical could revolutionize whole industries, things like paintable solar sells or a water filtration membrane could enable huge changes in the economy and society. 
  
It might be that it starts becoming increasingly obvious that no business or company is a safe investment, if people start pulling money out of old stalwarts then where will they put it?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Of course it's a bubble. This is how emerging industries work. Tons and tons of money floods into XYZ industry until most collapse and the remaining companies win the spoils.

In fact, China literally officially institutionalized this model. Each town will participate in building X business, and they all go in on trying to make them succeed. Eventually they slowly start dying off until the strongest remains, and that town is the "winner" and members of the government get promotions

It has its flaws, but god damn is it effective.</div>

And the issue with podcasters is their audience spends so much time with them that by the comedian is on stage for a theater show a lot of the humor and premises have been heard 100 times already. There's no comedic surprise at that point it's just fandom and celebrity.</div>

I describe even simple spreadsheet set-ups with intermediate formulas and ChatGPT / Copilot fuck it up more often than get it right.

If you tell me it takes better prompting, how is that useful? It takes lots of time to choose each word? It takes special skill in "prompt engineering"? Why do I have to learn how to talk to a machine in a way I would neither talk to normal software that needs precise instructions or a person who needs different precise instructions, but can meet me halfway on so many things?

You just replaced one specialized skill with another and if AI does it, you can't fix it easily. You consume time in a different way.

I fail to see the value behind the hype. Likely someday these problems will be removed but the idea that companies are getting rid of their personnel this soon just seems batshit to me.</div>

Same way you do it yourself, iteratively and in smaller steps.  You also need a good wrapper, cline or kilocode or codex.

Iteratively you describe in detail what you want to happen.  Have the model work on small pieces at a time.  Test those pieces with unit tests.  Setup custom instructions where the model knows to run the unit tests per step.  Use only the largest, most expensive and powerful models (Gemini 2.5 or GPT-5 codex).

When you encounter errors which will happen paste them in or let the model read them when running in full auto mode and iteratively fix the errors.</div>

On the other hand I still find them usefull as text processor, for task like:
- creating a translation of files
- breaking down monolith into atomic components
- documentation
- formatting list of unclean texts into objects
- extracting parts of the code into separate files
- doing basic image to components template 
- finding information or tutorial I used to look on stack overflow

And many more,

So overall with a correct and targeted usage, it allows me to focus much more on logic and architecture, while offloading time consuming but basic tasks to the AI.

Full automation of development seems ages away though</div>

That post is just the perfect example of taking a few data points and extrapolating into the future without doing a basic sanity check.

The METR paper talks about coding and engineering tasks. NOT ALL HUMAN TASKS. Unless everyone is doing a heavily quantitative job that requires nothing but just processing code (and still you would still need humans to act as architects and gatekeepers), this doesn't make any sense.</div>

Coding and engineering tasks are required for an autonomous AI system that is sufficiently competent that it can swallow the entire ML research / engineering tech tree. That is the system will produce many autonomous AI systems that can collectively and systematically do ALL HUMAN TASKS.

Better AI systems help them create even better AI systems.
It is currently slow recursive (human-in-the-loop) AI improvement. They need to speed that up by removing humans.

Most cant see the forest for the trees. Look at where they're heading.
It's fine if you don't think the massive investment in AI R&amp;D will succeed but you cant ignore they think they will succeed and are going to try, at any cost.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Look, I’m not trying to minimize legitimate concerns about AI oversight, but let’s get real about where we actually are.

You’ve been psychologically profiled and behaviorally manipulated for over a decade already. 
Every pause you make scrolling Instagram, every 3am YouTube rabbit hole, every time you switch to incognito mode and then hop back to social media 15 minutes later…that’s all data points building a psychological profile that gets monetized.

Your fitness tracker sells “anonymized” data that can be de-anonymized and tied back to your digital shadow with scary accuracy. Your purchase timing, location patterns, even your typing rhythm ..it’s all being analyzed to predict and influence your behavior.

The difference isn’t that OpenAI is doing psychological analysis,  it’s that someone finally called it what it is instead of hiding it behind “personalization” and “user experience optimization.”

At least when it’s an AI safety model, there’s arguably some benefit to the user (if done correctly). When it’s ad targeting algorithms, the only beneficiary is shareholder profit.

I’m glad people are finally waking up to this reality. But if we’re going to demand AI user rights (which we should), let’s demand them from ALL the companies that have been doing this for years, not just the one that got caught.</div>

It's actually been going on for more than a decade - anyone interested in how corporations &amp; governments have used psychoanalytic knowledge in order to manipulate &amp; control the masses should watch the Curtis documentary "The Century of the Self" (it used to be on YT).

I think what's happening now is that larger numbers are waking up to this, but it's literally been there since the emergence of the PR &amp; marketing field.</div>

But OAI routing paying customers according to live psychoanalysis by a machine…that was a line crossed that I had to speak up about. I’ve spoken up about other privacy concerns, for sure. But this one is new, and happening right damn now, so I wanted to make people aware. Thanks for your reflection on all of this!</div>

                <div class="post-content">So, I had an idea yesterday to try creating a simple **Raylib** test with r/warpdotdev and **GPT-5**. I knew it's reasoning capacity was great and honestly, apart from using planning mode in Warp, I hadn't really pushed GPT-5. So I did a simple test and was surprised by how quickly it was able to create a simple "Hello World' render. 

For those that don't know, Raylib is not a game engine. It's a simple, bare metal programming language where you can build games or engines from scratch.

I've thought about moving to a GR86 already, but I really don't care for the drivetrain.

                                <div class="reply-body">Subaru hates marketing the BRZ because they prioritize AWD, Safety *then* Sports cars/variants.

Toyota owns 20% of Fuji Heavy Industries, so Subaru didn't have much of a choice during development of the ZC6/ZN6.

Quick search:

"Reports from September 2025 indicate that there will be a future for the Toyota GR86, but it is unlikely to include a third-generation Subaru BRZ in the United States. Multiple sources suggest that the BRZ will be discontinued or go electric, potentially severing the long-standing partnership with Toyota for this sports car."</div>

Or maybe it's because everyone's sick of hearing about what billionaire CEOs think about anything.   
Or maybe it's because of how they're continuously ignoring the criticisms and dangers they're flippant about.   
Or maybe people have other things to worry about as their lives are being turned upside-down.

But I guess we'll never know.</div>

That, in fact he was thinking of staggering and slowing down the roll out so that people wouldn't get shocked and scared by the improvements. That kind of pissed me off at the time because I love being awed.

So, whether it was by design or not, congrats on making the increments so tiny that we are taking the boiling frog route to the singularity.
