The path to superintelligence is clear - you generate a huge amount of synthetic problems that are hard to solve but easy to validate.   
  
This can be done in faster iterations than pretraining, but doing this at scale requires a monumental shitton of compute.

And compute requires shittons of money to Jensen and power utilities.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">People generally do not need as much information as they think they do. Knowledge that cannot be applied in real life holds little value. Moreover, integrating knowledge into life is a gradual process, it cannot happen instantly, which is why one should focus on the basics and what interests him first, rather than diving into complex topics or intellectual debates.

Simply knowing intricate concepts does not contribute much to personal growth, though many believe otherwise and engage in futile competitions over who knows more, even though it hardly matters. As you pointed out, social media worsens this problem, acting both as a source of addiction on one end and a so called “platform for knowledge” on the other.

Social media has perfected “paralysis by analysis” and has become a significant drain on energy for many. Honestly, most people would be far better off reading old encyclopedias than wasting time on social media, including the very people on this subreddit.</div>

It took me a long time to figure out that for me, having more information did not make me do more things…it just made me second guess myself because there was always some piece of contradictory information out there.

                        <div class="comment-body">As someone who develops screen time management tools, I really relate to this. These platforms like Reddit absolutely can be gold mines of information when used intentionally - whether it’s catching up on news, solving technical problems, or finding niche communities. The key is having systems in place to manage usage.

One effective approach I’ve found is timeboxing - setting specific time windows for social media use combined with app blockers. This way you can still benefit from the valuable content while avoiding those endless scrolling sessions and “parasocial rabbit holes” you mentioned. It’s not about complete abstinence, but rather creating boundaries that help maintain focus and discipline.

The platforms themselves aren’t inherently bad - it’s the unconscious, unlimited consumption that causes issues. With the right controls in place, they can be genuinely useful tools rather than attention traps.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The bigger question is how could you possibly explain what store you’re likely to go to your dog who has zero idea how the human economy or society functions, much less any way to communicate those concepts to your dog.

Sure, you could severely dumb it down with with pictures so they may associate a picture of dogfood with a picture of Petco and milk with a grocery store. Then, you could show your dog your shopping list and he could point to the right store. But your dog would have no concept about of all the reasoning humans go through to select the right store. They just can’t even begin to comprehend it - much less the far greater human ecosystem and capitalism and $$.

OP’s point is that this will be the same with humans and ASI. Initially, the ASI’s explanations will make sense - more-or-less. But as the ASI advances, humans will quickly realize they have no fucking clue as to how ASIs make decisions. At all. 

While I’m sure the ASI’s can provide reasonable “sounding” explanations, they won’t come close to describing the true complexities that go into their decisions anymore than we can explain why we need a job to earn $$ so we can buy dog food at Petco for our dog. All our dog knows is: “me hungry, go Petco”. And that’s how we’ll sound to the ASI.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/PositiveSong2293:

---

"On December 31, Sam Shoemate, an intelligence officer and Chief Warrant Officer 2 (retired from the U.S. Army), received an email allegedly sent by Matthew Livelsberger, who would later be identified as the author of the detonation of a Tesla Cybertruck at Trump Tower the following day. In this disturbing document, Livelsberger boldly states: "What I am about to send will change the course of humanity."


In the email manifesto, Matthew Livelsberger makes a series of statements covering various topics related to national security and military operations.


But the most striking part of the email comes when the whistleblower addresses the issue of drones in the U.S.


Livelsberger claims that China is responsible for the recent wave of drones over U.S. soil, detailing the use of gravitational propulsion systems in aircraft. He emphasizes that, according to his information, Chinese operations have been escalating, with drones being launched from submarines in the Atlantic. Equipped with high stealth capabilities and unlimited payload capacity, these drones pose a significant threat, being able to operate in an almost undetectable manner."

                        <div class="comment-body">Let me share an interesting perspective on this, drawing from both personal observation and historical context. Pre-smartphone era wasn't some magical time of deep focus - we just had different distractions. Picture someone in 1995 at their desk: they're probably doodling on a notepad, chatting with coworkers, checking their pager, flipping through magazines, or getting up for their fifth coffee run. The human brain has always been prone to wandering. What's fundamentally different now isn't our capacity for focus - it's the nature of the interruptions. Before, distractions were mostly passive (like a magazine sitting on your desk) or scheduled (like a TV show at 8pm). Now, they're active and random: notifications ping at unpredictable times, creating what psychologists call a "variable reward schedule" - the same mechanism that makes slot machines so addictive.

**Here's a telling detail:** libraries in the 1950s had signs asking people to be quiet - because people were talking and socializing instead of reading. Office workers in the 1980s would read newspapers, play with desk toys, do crossword puzzles, or gossip by the water cooler instead of working. Students in the 1970s passed notes in class instead of paying attention. The real shift isn't in our ability to focus - it's in the effort required to maintain focus. Before, you had to actively seek out most distractions. Now, you have to actively defend against them. It's like the difference between choosing to go to a party versus having a party randomly burst into your room several times an hour.

What we're nostalgic for isn't better focus - it's the ability to choose when to be distracted. The solution isn't to idealize the past, but to reclaim that choice in the present.</div>

But I will say that with smartphones, I crave the distraction more. It’s also harder to let go of the distraction now.</div>

I'm suddenly reminded of "WKRP in Cincinnati", station manager Arthur Carlson playing with his toy choo-choo trains in his office...

Things like movie theaters also strongly encouraged long attention spans. You couldn't pause. You couldn't rewind. You had to stay glued to your seat the entire length of the movie if you wanted to see it all, and if you got distracted, you missed part of it. 

TV was a little less demanding on the attention span, but there, too, you couldn't pause or rewind. There were commercial breaks every 10-15 minutes and it was a national mad scramble to go to the bathroom, get your snack, and rush back to the couch before the commercials ended. 

Couldn't pause or rewind radio, either. No VCRs yet, so no way to rent videos. 

I recall the movies and TV shows of the pre-internet era tended to be much slower-paced than the modern stuff. Example, Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West", and Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey". 

In the 1970s, that slow pace just added to the intensity of the experience, allowing you to absorb and ponder and built up the emotional experience of it.

Today, folks in their 20s consider both movies to be just too boring to watch because of their glacially slow pacing. 

MTV marks the beginning of the fast multi-shot editing style of 80s music videos, which spread throughout the movie and TV industry, which in turn was borrowed from the whip-saw editing of TV commercials, often 10-15 seconds in length and you had to capture an audience's attention in that time, and make it memorable.

People were just as distractable then as today; the tech of the time was just way less distracting than now. Packed far less machine-gun style dopamine hits.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">George Soros literally began his philanthropy in 1979, giving scholarships to Black South Africans under apartheid, so of course Elon hates him.

Also this from his foundation:
"
He was one of the early prominent voices to criticize the war on drugs as “arguably more harmful than the drug problem itself,” and helped kick-start America’s medical marijuana movement. In the early 2000s, he became a vocal backer of same-sex marriage efforts. Though his causes have evolved over time, they continue to hew closely to his ideals of an open society. "

They make them to relate to specific demographics so they can manipulate their opinions. "As a queer black gay man I will vote for Trump!! You should too, fellow gay queer black men!"

They put a LOT of effort into these troll accounts. Some getting very popular and post top tier funny stuff for the sake of gaining trust. Im not sure a actual AI bot could successfully grow an op account but maybe.

If the account doesn't gain traction they make them behave in terrible and antisocial ways so they can use the screenshots to farm anti-lgbt/racist (pick your demographic) circlejerks.. or just use them to mob people.

They tried a ton of crazy stuff with fake influencers. All for the purpose of swaying public opinion. And nothing gets done about it! There are already millions of these all working for thousands of different causes.</div>

It's not their "advanced drones" being deployed, but "older" tech used, as he said, as a show of force.

Like a, "hey, look what we can do" kind of thing. It'd be even more "insulting" if it's not their "advanced" tech being used.

Again, I don't personally buy the manifesto. I think you're right that it's a ff.

But that's pretty much it, hopefully Grok 3 is an actual contender for best model, although i doubt it</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Kind of like the episodes when some guy hacked the DOD’s UFO intelligence files and gave it to Mulder, who was being drugged with LSD via his water supply in an attempt to get him fired from the FBI. 

Only after then he was shot by Scully in an attempt to stop him from self-incriminating himself after being framed for his father’s murder. Later in New Mexico, after an assassination attempt he discovered what was on those files, they found a mountain vault in West Virginia filled with tissue samples collected by the government (Which Mulder’s father authorized) from people who received the smallpox vaccination, which were then used to create human-alien test subjects at the hand of Nazi and Japanese doctors brought over to the US during Operation Paper Clip.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly, here was my comment on a previous post that was removed by moderators:

For the 10 comments on here saying "we would know if Chinese subs were off the East Coast!!"

What collective "we" are you referencing? As far as I can tell from this sub this should be a bunch of people interested in UFOs going about their daily lives, not a bunch of naval sonar operators sitting scanning the ocean and saying "No way bro, we'd see that."

I agree that everything we see on here needs to be taken with a grain of salt but come on. Do you think if there were subs off the East Coast that the Navy would go around broadcasting that information? Our government is somewhat lacking on the transparency side of things. Their main excuse for not releasing video footage or sensor data of UAP is that it would give away our detection capabilities. I firmly believe that if anyone's subs are off of any coast, "we" the people would be the last to know.

This is just as plausible as anything else that we see on here, but the amount of low-level debunking seen in the comments raises some questions. What about this post/information creates such an immediate pushback?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You know what's really fucking odd? The second the video was released, hundreds of rando accounts were trying hard to get people to believe it was an accident and that the explosion was just the lithium batteries. Even giving several minute long videos trying desperately to prove it was just a defective battery. Anyone who said fireworks was down voted to oblivion and spammed with dissertations of how it was just a battery. Like no one claiming fireworks even gave 2 shits just said fireworks and dipped, while battery people were on a mission. Everyone who seemed normal basically knew we'd get official information sooner than later. 

Now with this email rando people were desperate as fuck to try and get it disproved and deleted from these subreddits.

It just feels no different than when election cycles are going on. It really feels like we're talking to a wall of bots or astroturfing accounts being paid to force an agenda.</div>

Copying from another comment of mine as to “why?”

From the CIA’s Cold War-era Operation Mockingbird, which covertly paid journalists to push certain narratives, to the FBI’s COINTELPRO, targeting activist groups through infiltration and disinformation, governments have long sought to shape public opinion. More recently, the U.S. military was tied to Operation Earnest Voice, aimed at influencing foreign sentiment via social media “sock puppet” accounts, while the UK’s GCHQ ran the JTRIG unit (exposed by Snowden leaks) to conduct online “covert action.” Even the British Army’s 77th Brigade specializes in “information warfare.” Each program differs in scope and era, but they share a core strategy: using media—now including digital platforms—to steer narratives, often with minimal public transparency. Whether you view it as propaganda or national security, it’s a reminder that governments worldwide have repeatedly tested the boundaries of manipulating public perception.</div>

So if you are like me, my number one tip to you is this… Do not say to others what you will do, just keep it a secret to yourself, and do it anyway.

The reason for this strategy is to make you mentally strong and internally motivated so you will not struggle to find motivation and do the things you said you would...</div>

If anything, TikTok will just be replaced by a clone or it will be replaced by existing platforms implementing the same engagement-hogging strategies.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly this. A lot of “brain rot” content exists elsewhere, and of course addiction to these apps is very real. However, a lot of important information - voices being oppressed and censored in real time - is shared on the platform. TikTok is an actual threat to those who wish to control “free” speech. To throw the baby out with the bath water on this is to silence independent thought, while making those in power more powerful.  </div>

This is what another OpenAI employee said. Take it with a grain of salt, but keep in mind that all the strawberry trolling did not turn out to be baseless hype. So there might be something here for those of us who love hype.</div>

Releasing an AI video game (because anybody can release anything it doesn’t have to actually be good or profitable) has essentially already happened. Company run by AI is also guaranteed because again it doesn’t have to be a good one. Household robot is also a pretty safe bet but it will be stupidly expensive and not very useful.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Right. The “AI finds a cure for cancer” one in particular stood out to me. That’s not just a singular point of time thing and AI has already been used to find potential cures. They then need to be tested and go through clinical trials. So what really does it even mean? The invention of a drug that cures cancer (which we might not know for years or more) or the completion of a trial of a drug that was found years ago? Either way, it’s not really what the card is saying unless you interpret it in a very flexible way.</div>

Torso and Abdomen
	•	Organomegaly: Internal organs, such as the heart, liver, and kidneys, may enlarge due to prolonged exposure to HGH.
	•	HGH Belly (Distended Abdomen): A common effect of long-term HGH misuse is visceral organ growth and thickened abdominal muscles, leading to a protruding abdomen despite having low body fat.
	•	Increased Muscle Mass: Excess HGH can lead to disproportionate muscle growth, altering body symmetry.</div>

As if spending so much time studying AI and Comp Sci wasn't enough, he went and got another PhD in neuroscience and published a bunch of groundbreaking work in that field as well. It reads like the background of some genius comic book hero.

His greatest weakness is that he's not as concerned with making products as he is with the research. That certainly came back to bite Google, but now that DeepMind is paying attention, I think we're going to see some very exciting things in the coming years.</div>
