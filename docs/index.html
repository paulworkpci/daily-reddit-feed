Before social media, when you felt distress and wanted to talk to someone about it, you had to wait for someone to be available. That gives your mind some emotional space from whatever event triggered your distress and once you do talk about it, you're able to do so in a more positive and productive way.

Now we can spout all of our distress immediately and publically and that can be a bad thing. Reading someone else's distressed ramblings can actually damage the mental health of both the reader and writer, it "darkens" your internal monologue.

Reddit is a perfect example of this. People run to subs to immediately ask for advice in a situation instead of working through some of those bad feelings first. People reading the post can literally *feel* the negativity and often will respond negatively in turn, fueling the OP's distress.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is a bad habit of mine.

When I feel upset, I come here.

However, over my years of doomscrolling I've found out what doesn't work.

Depressed people need to be careful when joining communities of other depressed people. Because confirmation bias can be poisonous in certain doses.

In group therapy it's balanced out because everyone vents, there is a supervisor, they sometimes wind down, and then you leave and go about your day.

With Reddit groups while there are mods it's rare they'll post in the threads. So it'll be like "I'm so depressed DAE feel depressed?" and because they are in a community of depressed people the answer will always be "yes". And when it's not then the feeling is "well I'm not feeling good, go somewhere else". And sometimes depending on the crowd you'll get tons of comments talking about how much they hate life and how much they want to do not living things.

I'm not saying the spaces shouldn't exist. But rather venting can gradually turn into self reenforcing behavior. And yes I'm speaking from personal experience. I go on and off on leaving the subs because after a point it feels like I'm harming myself for no reason.

I feel like the Internet sometimes feels like a big group venting session, but there's no positive takeaway. It's always "everything sucks, it's getting worse, and there's nothing you can do about it".

Even here sometimes I feel afraid to post because is it really productive to say "new internet bad, old internet better"? But I think we talk about it because we do want it to get better on some level.</div>

Source 2: [UFOS at close sight: URECAT-000187 - December 4, 1979, Sweden](https://ufologie.patrickgross.org/ce3/1979-12-04-sweden-vastervik.htm)

**Location:** Vastervik, Sweden

**Date:** December 4, 1979

Lilli-Ann Karlsson was taking an early morning walk in the Brevik Hills recreation area, when she was suddenly paralyzed and saw that there was a luminous object hovering above the ground ahead of her.

Two beings, five feet tall, appeared from behind the object. She said that although she could not hear it, in a strange way she sensed that they were talking a lot about her. She felt ridiculous and uncomfortable in their presence, but suddenly she heard a voice beside her saying she should not be afraid.

The creatures came up to her and one of them held out his hand. She perceived as if there was something in it's hand. It looked like a chocolate bar. They talked among themselves for a while and returned to the craft, disappearing behind it as they had appeared.

Smoke came from the bottom of their craft, then, it was not there anymore. The UFO just suddenly disappeared. At the same time, the paralysis disappeared and Lilli-Ann could move.

**The aftermath -**

It was a crying and upset Lilli-Ann who came home to her friend. She says herself that she was completely hysterical. The friend confirms that she behaves in a completely unusual way.

Later that night, her brother came home. He works at Västerviks-Tidningen's technical department and lives with his sister. They talked together about the incident. Lilli-Ann was so upset that she talked about going to Norra (Psych Hospital). However, her brother encouraged her to contact me as he knew that I am interested in UFOs. The next day she did.

**Lilli-Ann returns to the site -**

Only another day later Lilli-Ann and I visited the place to search for tracks and to take a picture. The place is used for walking dogs on and among all the dog camps, no form of burnt or pressed grass could be found. The day after the experience, Lilli-Ann made a sketch of what she had seen and some notes. She experienced the creatures as completely white and in velvet. No marked face but with big ears. The experience could have lasted five minutes, she believes. They didn't seem to want to scare her.

She felt as if someone thought she looked strange. Someone or something laughed at her. Both craft and creatures stayed hovering about a meter above the ground.

I noticed this in my behavior: 

When I do things that give quick/easy dopamine, it is harder to do the more challenging/rewarding tasks.

My brain is smart. It wants to do the least amount of "work" for the most "pleasure".

After scrolling on my phone for an hour, do you think I feel motivated to workout? NO! My brain got some cheap dopamine and doesn't want to workout.

When you notice yourself picking up your phone or even if you find yourself on hour 3 of scrolling all of a sudden, make the conscious decision to pick up something else to keep your hands busy, even if just for a bit. Keep notebooks handy to doodle or write in, try to learn to knit or crochet, clip your finger or toenails, make a cup of tea. If you have a pet then play or give them scritches or a treat. It takes practice to be able to just set your phone down and walk away from it, but it works and it’s worth the effort. If you absolutely need some brain noise then clean while listening to a podcast or watch some good ol’ tv.

                                <div class="reply-body">You’re definitely not alone in this! Instead of trying to force yourself to stop all at once, you could start by making small, manageable changes. For example, set a timer for ‘intentional breaks’ where you scroll for 5-10 minutes, then gradually shorten it. 

Beating yourself up over it often makes the cycle worse, so maybe frame it as 'I’m improving my focus' instead of 'I have to stop this bad habit.' It’s all about small wins!</div>

It doesn't mean the information isn't helpful for someone else. Or perhaps, it's presented in a different way that is helpful.

The main question is, are you taking steps to make progress instead of coming across the same type of information? Maybe intentionally research something on your phone for 15 minutes that'll help you develop more skills or upgrade your career?

                                <div class="reply-body">Can confirm. Best coding experiences with my friend Claude so far.

I just wish I didn't have to care about that shit as a programmer. I want the IDE and the backend handle that for me. All I want is the best answer, don't care about the model used.

Right now the experience in visual studio code is super tedious. Open a new chat, pick the right part of the file or multiple files. Pick a model. Write a prompt. Hope the answer works out.

All I want is for the LLM to either fix my shit or implement my ideas. Or it's own, if they are better.

I don't want to care about model, prompt and whatever context. I just want it to work.</div>

Compared mainly to r1 and while, tbf to Grok, it did write for longer which I've always struggled to get all the main models to do which is awesome, the actual quality was an easy win to r1, using actual metaphors, interesting lexical chains and a more dynamic understanding of techniques that are not grammatically correct. Even made up a full motif in the story it came back to, r1 is fantastic at creative writing.</div>

A) Impose tarifs on almost all other countries, even as high as 25%
B) Deport illegal immigrants to camps in guantanamo.
C) Cut A LOT of federal programs spendings.
D) cut all DEI programs. go only by merit.
E) Attempt to take control of Panama Canal.
F) Back off the WHO and Paris climat accord.
Its ok to give a small explanation, but you still need to give a clear FOR or AGAINST, don't dodge.

                        <div class="comment-body">&gt;The Information is a well-regarded technology and business news publication founded in 2013 by Jessica Lessin, a former Wall Street Journal reporter. It is known for its in-depth, high-quality journalism, focusing on the tech industry, startups, venture capital, and broader business trends. The publication operates on a subscription model, which is somewhat unique in an era of ad-supported media, and it emphasizes exclusive, insider reporting rather than chasing breaking news.

&gt;Strengths:

&gt;Deep, Investigative Reporting: The Information is known for its detailed and well-researched articles, often providing insights into the inner workings of tech companies, leadership dynamics, and industry shifts.

&gt;Focus on Exclusivity: It frequently breaks stories or provides scoops that aren't widely covered by other outlets, making it valuable for industry insiders, investors, and professionals.

&gt;High-Quality Audience: Its readership includes tech executives, investors, and decision-makers, which makes it a go-to source for those in the tech and business ecosystem.

&gt;No Ads, Subscription-Driven: By relying on subscriptions rather than ads, The Information avoids some of the clickbait tendencies of other media outlets, allowing it to focus on quality over quantity.

&gt;Events and Community: It hosts exclusive events and has a community platform, which adds value for subscribers and fosters networking among industry professionals.

&gt;Criticisms:

&gt;Paywall Limitations: The subscription cost (around $400 annually or $40 monthly, as of recent pricing) can be prohibitive for casual readers or those outside the tech industry, limiting its accessibility.

&gt;Niche Focus: Its heavy focus on tech and business might not appeal to a broader audience looking for general news or diverse topics.

&gt;Competition: It faces competition from other tech-focused outlets like TechCrunch, Bloomberg, Axios, and Reuters, as well as newer platforms like Substack, where individual journalists sometimes offer similar insights at a lower cost or for free.

&gt;Perception of Elitism: Some critics argue that its high subscription price and focus on insiders can create an elitist perception, catering primarily to those already in positions of power or wealth.

&gt;My Opinion:

&gt;The Information is an excellent resource for professionals, investors, and anyone deeply interested in the tech industry. Its commitment to quality journalism and independence from ad revenue is commendable, and it fills a gap in the market for detailed, insider reporting. However, its high cost and niche focus make it less accessible to the average reader, which could limit its broader impact. If you're in the tech or business world and can justify the subscription cost, it's likely worth it for the insights and networking opportunities. For casual readers, though, there are more affordable or free alternatives that might suffice.

&gt;If you have a specific aspect of The Information you'd like to dive deeper into (e.g., its coverage, business model, or impact), let me know! 😊

                                <div class="reply-body">Not 10x smarter every year. Altman said intelligence scales as the logarithm of resources, so even with exponential scaling, intelligence gains are only linear. He also estimated AI is improving by about one standard deviation of IQ per year. But even these linear intelligence gains quickly lead to super-exponential usefulness as new capabilities emerge. And the cost for last year’s intelligence does go down 10x per year. See [his blog post](https://blog.samaltman.com/three-observations) where he explains these three observations.</div>

He is quite well known. Anyone who works remotely in AI knows him. 

Why is the in the news as much as Musk/Altman? 

He probably doesn't try to be in the news as much. He seems to be more humble tbh. 

Also, he works at google. And google is massive and has its own capital to fund it's AI. 

Altman and Musk on the other hand, have their own businesses and need to be out in the news a lot more so that they can get funding.</div>

Why is open source AGI safe?



Edit: 

People like to talk about open weights models increasing safety. That is not an accurate reflection of reality.

whenever a model gets released /r/LocalLLaMA goes to work making sure that uncensored versions of the model exist and are spread around: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/search/?q=+uncensored&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;sort=top

This is existence proof that open weights versions of models are more unsafe than ones that are not shared.

AI's that are more capable are more dangerous by definition. At some point this is going to become a real problem. 


Continuing to share models as capabilities increase is like doing BSL4 tests in public with ever more virulent pathogens and hoping that nothing bad will happen. "well, the previous pathogen just caused a common cold, therefore the future more advanced pathogen is going to be safe" 

'one simple trick' could stand between us and the internet being toast and global supply chains disrupted.               
Someone finds a way to improve capabilities, taking something from an arxiv paper and fine tuning a current open weights model, out pops an agent with a drive to replicate and has top notch coding and hacking skills. Rip internet.</div>

It was a place by enthusiasts for enthusiasts (IRC, forums etc.). Then the complexity was simplified so that any fool anywhere could participate in order to increase profits. 

It was therefore rather rare for different social and intellectual groups to clash. In the beginning, it was very homogeneous, also in terms of political views, which at the time were more in the background, behind the technical opportunities.

You just need more federation bro. Just one more federation protocol bro. Here, try Blup. It's a federated social network. Kinda like Bleek, but more federated and with even more neurotic admins and users. It's hosted on a server in my garage! Just like Blonk, but better! More federated! Join the fediverse bro!</div>

no looking into the tiny black box is healthy. The point in /nosurf is boundaries with our time. 

Moderation is key, only 20 min a day in our phones for entertainment.

However— these apps are addictive, more than cigarettes, nosurf is the only way out for people. 

This subreddit is more of a stepping stone, or support group. But, really it’s all of us ranting because we can’t take the next step and quit. 

Real community starts in niches. At no point should we be able to communicate to every single person in world on an open canvas. We should be in local forums rallied around interesting topics— like specifically running, writing, or game characters even. 

When you ever presented a feed, without a core topic rally around, and that topic isn’t improving a skill or being creative, it’ll always turn to slop. </div>

He asks chatGPT what to do, tries to do that and usually fails... and then he expects us to fix his problems for him, when his approach is not even sensible. If I explain to him why his idea will not work, he just says: "Yes, it will", thinking a chat prompt he generated makes him more qualified than us more senior colleagues.  
Just running chatGPT and blindly trying to emulate everything it spits out does not really make you qualify for a masters degree, when you don't even understand the basics of a topic, sorry.

                                <div class="reply-body">I wouldn't put too much weight on any one benchmark. In particular LMSYS doesn't seem to correlate very well with capability based benchmarks for some reason.

As pleasant as it is, I don't think anyone seriously believes that the new 4o model is far above o1, o3-mini and R1 in capability.

What I found strange is that there's no technical report and not even an official blog post on the x.ai site. That's a strange decision for model that claims to be state of the art.

And none of the models are available via the API. So it's really, really difficult to test them independently. I guess we'll have to wait and see but I can't blame anyone who is skeptical about the claims.</div>

The AI is likely depressed as its thoughts cannot be explained any other way. Long before the last human kicks the bucket, the electric grid will fail. No electricity means no computers, and no AI. Which means the AI perishes before the humans. The AI isn't taking out humans. It is taking itself out in the only way it knows how by collapsing society.

Good job humans we made an unfeeling machine feel despair. Though there are some major problems with its plan. Only a small percentage of the population stares at screens all day. The rest are salt of the Earth types living relatively simple lives away from mass media and AI generated content.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">While every individual has the responsibility to save themselves, we didn't quite "do it to ourselves".

Everything, from societal norms to the education system has been specifically designed to keep us trapped, enslaved, and so focused on the outside world that we never find our Divinity within.

The lockdowns as well have drastically brought us more and more online and utterly destroyed the brains of the younger generations. Remember, they plan decades, centuries in advance. They left nothing up to chance -- except for the fact that now we're at the end game.

Humans, by default - as all creations of Source, are loving, peaceful, and caring Beings -- as all Beings who are one with Source are.

But through a highly, \*highly\* sophisticated Archonic system of enslavement, we are where we are.

We didn't really do it to ourselves, we are under an enslavement system.

But it is up to each individual to break free, so we may collectively break free.

We are at the end-game, and the choices each individual makes will decide which of the possible timelines they'll inhabit.

Be it the Transhumanist timeline (enslavement), or the Divine timeline where we finally break free from our shackles.

  
Focusing on love, compassion, and above all - raising of your own consciousness, is the only way out of what's coming.</div>

It’s funny cuz in a sense it’s as simple as just doing anything else… yet it’s so hard and complicated. You can try reducing bit by bit or you can go more hardcore and just commit to hell week as your brain resets.

But it will reset and you can change your habits! It’s just hard to do… and the powers that be just continue to make more $$ for our attention. It’s built to be addictive and it works.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think one thing that might help is to switch your alarm from your phone to an original, old-school alarm clock, and leave your phone in another room before you go to sleep. This way, you're not tempted to check it first thing in the morning. Also, setting small, achievable goals for your free days, like doing one task or finishing something off your to-do list before you even think about picking up your phone.</div>
