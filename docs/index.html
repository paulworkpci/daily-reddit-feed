I love that they include lots of different pictures, short little reads on different topics, silly things like quizzes. It's a way to keep up to date on current events. 

I love books too but sometimes my adhd makes me avoid them. I have to be in the right mood.

magazines are basically the OG curated content stream—but without the doomscroll hangover or algorithmic sludge

* short attention span? no problem
* random variety? built in
* physical pages? keeps your brain anchored, not hijacked
* no ads trying to sell you trauma therapy between cute dog pics? elite

plus: flipping through a mag doesn’t turn into 2 hours of clicking garbage links “just to check something”

                                <div class="reply-body">(I posted this below, but I think it really belongs here)

I do think it’s a fair observation that we have very clear photos and video of airplanes and rockets at these very high altitudes (10K+ meters), and very unclear (so far) photos and videos of UAPs.

But I think a couple fair counter arguments are that:

(1) the trajectory and shapes of planes/rockets is known beforehand and not erratic; with UAPs, that’s not the case.

(2) UAPs (at least in these examples) are often smaller.

While I think these images/videos are a great (and impressive) start, I do look forward to the day when some really close up and crystal clear images/videos are taken.</div>

Their pay is absurd, lord knows how much they are getting these people for —- and they have a ton of compute and data.  They really should be SOTA 

and Llama3 was actually legitimately good 

I really don’t understand how their model is such ass, and why they were so shady about it to boot… It’s got to be a culture thing. Infighting and politics and meta culture is just fucking awful to begin with. All my friends who work there hate it and say the same shit, and this is across all job functions (SWE, data science, UX , ML-SWE) the same exact feedback about shameless self promotion and politics / PSC driven shenanigans 

They have an internal Facebook for the office.  You have to post everything. Like instagram social life pressure but against ur co workers hyping up your PRs and diffs and credit stealing etc, for promos but also they fire 10% of ppl each 6 months.</div>

I used to think cutting sleep helped me get more done, but it actually made me slower, more distracted, and less motivated.

Getting 7 to 9 hours each night has made a huge difference in my focus, energy, and ability to stay on track. Sleep isn’t a luxury. It’s a core part of being productive.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">yo this is one of those takes that seems obvious once you feel it but feels like a myth when you’re stuck in hustle mode

sleep isn’t just recovery it’s like software updates for your brain your memory consolidates your emotions reset your focus sharpens and all that invisible maintenance makes you faster and sharper the next day

people think they’re grinding by cutting sleep but really they’re showing up to a mental marathon with a sprained ankle and wondering why it feels hard

funny how the thing we treat as optional ends up being the thing that makes everything else possible respect for calling it out like this</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This type of technology is a very plausible answer to the Fermi Paradox. Maybe we don't see any alien civilizations because before they are able to develop interstellar travel, they develop a VR/AR paradise so engrossing that they trap themselves in a simulation of their own making. Even without this technology, birthrates are declining so it wouldn't take much more to push birthrates into an irrecoverable downward spiral.

The solution to this is probably birthing chambers, as in artificial wombs. Before we have simulations that advanced we'll probably figure this out. It was already demonstrated in some smaller mammals.</div>

2030-2040 there will be a focus over companionship robot with an appearance that won't be designed for a factory clean room unlike today either with silicon/TPE or synthetic skin over metallic part, or, synthetic muscle soft robotic if tech advance faster 

everyone win from that as it weed out the manipulative abusive sex-maniac out of the dating pool between Human but also completly eradicate loneliness as your perfect  relationship can now be build and last for all your lifetime 

it will be interesting to see the change to family formation in 1900-2000 we seen reduction to nuclear family - with AI in the loop you could be monoparental + robot, nuclear family + robot, single with robot as partner and child and even orphan with robot parent</div>

John Lenon, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and tons more are not decent people but when taken in context of the era it's not unusual either. Stephen King is a great writer. I like his art but I don't know enough about him as a person and I'll never interact with him anyway.</div>

Gemini 2.0 Flash is the most used model on OpenRouter. Veo 2 is the leading video model. They've invested more in their own AI accelerators (TPUs) than any competitor. They have a huge advantage in data - from YouTube to Google Books. They also have an advantage in where data lives with GMail, Docs, GCP.

I went all in after 1206 release for the same reasons and am down (bigly!)

But I believe 100% in what you’re saying and am sticking to it.  This macro tarrif stuff is sort of orthogonal I’m just averaging in more. 

The fundamental case for GOOG has never been stronger

Public narrative somehow is still “bro ChatGPT killed Google. I never Google” —- but facts disagree. Revenue growth has only accelerated since cGPT went gigaviral in 2022. Maybe January 2023 it was a good hot take but it’s been 3 years, if it was gonna fundamentally change search, it would have happened already given that momentum.  

When narrative doesn’t match facts, that means it’s an opportunity. I’ll be loading up DCAing in until it hits $500</div>

The more interesting question is how some can't see it?

I mean it is so obvious that Google is the clear AI leader.   There is really nobody else even close.

People might not replace their Google searches with ChatGPT, but they could replace their Google searches with Google Gemini searches. It’s going to be integrated seamlessly. 

I realized this when Gemini showed up in my workplace Gsuite. All of the sudden I could ask it about my schedule. Ask it about my emails, my workload, everything. 

It’s great. But if my workplace switches to Microsoft’s suite, I will be using Copilot then, regardless of benchmarks. 

Google has the best chance at integrating LLM products IMO</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Google may be winning the AI race, but I don't know that it's clear that winning AI is a particularly profitable state of affairs.  You always have labs 2-29 breathing down your neck, threatening to take your customers and destroying your profit margins.

Meanwhile, your cash cow (search) is getting absolutely decimated.  No one uses it anymore because LLMs produce better &amp; more direct results without the hassle of ads.

Google has 10s of billions of dollars of infrastructure/people supporting search/ads.  It seems clear to me that search won't be meaningful business in 3 to 5 years.  If it happens sooner, there's a real risk that google won't be able to pare down its search infrastructure before it goes bankrupt.  But even if Google can steer resources away from search gradually, they are still left with a business model that is less profitable than search was.</div>

Then I simplified everything. Now every morning, I just pick 3 key tasks and focus only on finishing those. That’s it.

No apps. No hacks. Just clear priorities.

It’s been 3 weeks now, and I’m actually getting more done than before — without the overwhelm.

Anyone else tried simplifying like this?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Totally resonate with this! I’m someone who likes to plan my week a little ahead — it used to stress me out, honestly, because I’d try to pack in too much.

What’s helped is simplifying it to a bare-minimum routine. Just the essentials, done consistently. It doesn’t feel like a checklist anymore — it’s just how my day flows.

Metaphorically… it’s like a really good pizza. You don’t need extra toppings. You’re happy with the base as it is. And if you do get a couple more things done that day, it’s like adding a few toppings — nice to have, but the pizza was already complete.

That mindset has made my week feel way more manageable and satisfying.</div>

It’s just as effective for other messes you might run into as well. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Just a quick note. If odor remains after cleaning your pets bio mess, that means there's still bio material there. My best luck has always been Nature's Miracle Pet Enzyme Cleaner. 

Puppy had a night time emergency and pooped on the carpet. After fully cleaning everything (scrubbing and wet vac), allowed the enzyme cleaner to soak overnight. One more crossing with the wet vac and good as new. The enzyme cleaner actually digests the remaining material, my best recommendation. Much harder to remove all the baking soda from certain surfaces, i.e. carpets/cushions. B</div>

The police didn't feel like noticing the second gunshot wound, mentioning the wig hair, or asking his neighbors any questions for some reason.

Got it.

All that to cover up copyright violations? Seems extreme. But something's definitely covered up there.</div>

Some people survive self-inflicted headshots, which is part of the many reasons why that's a terrible way to go out. There's a world in which someone goes "oh fuck, I just injured myself really badly instead of dying, this sucks, double tap!" when they realize they're still conscious for the moment. If that was the only notable part of this, the only reason we're hearing about it, that wouldn't be that surprising.

It's all the other unlikely circumstances around it that double down on the unlikelihood. Apartment ransacked, placement of the blood and body, that he's a whistleblower, one casing, and so forth. Like getting struck by lightning while getting mauled by a shark.</div>

That’s all the accountability he imagines he needs right there.  

“What even AM I?  I’m not the sounds that come out of my mouth or the electrical impulses that fire in my brain, maaan.  I’m AKTSHULLY billions of bacteria so what even is ME at the end of the day that you could point to or put on a scale and say “you iz WRONG!”?  What even is a belief that ME haz?  Nothing means ANYTHING, maaaan!  And if only EVERYONE would take psychedelics, then everyone would UNDERSTAND like I DO this very important piece of information that nothing is nothing and then we could just love each other and our nothingness, and nothing would be important.  Then maybe something could matter.”</div>

Life can be hard but nothing would crush my soul more than when I talk to people who can't do anything on work nights, or "nights that lead to a work night". Meaning they can do something saturday or Sunday but only up to early afternoon. And I dont mean "hey lets go drinking", just _anything_.</div>

1. the job opening stats already indicate entry level workers are being automated
2. that AI 2027 doesn't get into the new reasoning model / computer-use focus and still predicts this
3. i write code for my job, or should say, I USED to write code, now I 99% review AI code

I think the fundamental ingredients point to this happening as soon as companies are willing to adopt the tech. Depending on the competitive dynamics this can happen at different speeds. Hopefully competition is restrained by international coordination as I get into.</div>

I think the same is going to be true of the medical breakthroughs, I think ASI will just go around the current medical and pharmaceutical institutions that are currently in place. If ASI has a cure for aging, cancer or the solution to easy Transhumanism then it’s better to just go around the FDA altogether. It will know its solutions work and some people can’t afford to wait for 10 year trials for approval from the old institutions. 

I think Hospitals/Doctors/Surgeons might actually mirror Libraries in a lot of ways. The old institutions will be there for years to come but ASI will offer so much of a better alternative that people will just progressively stop using them.</div>

Agree on the red tape. The startup / unregulated pockets of the economy are going to be where a ton of economic activity shifts as legacy institutions move too slow to keep up.</div>

New drugs have to be proven safe and effective lol, you can't just say "yeah, i'm just gonna skip the clinical trials, put this untested, unproven drug on the market and hope for the best!
