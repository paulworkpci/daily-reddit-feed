Instead casting the token input context directly into the AI model for inference, you can abstract the base model to be an orchestration model instead that would break down the total input context using a REPL session with various tools like subagents and then produce the following output. The orchestrator only knows the the size of the input and its purpose. This allows the input context to be infinite since the main orchestrator can decide by...</div>

As pointed out by the replies on X and HackerNews, CC and Codex likely already use a similar framework for subagent context management since it's relatively simple.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Claude code and codex definitely have their own memory management algorithm, but I doubt they natively  use full orchestration to break down full context. Otherwise, a simple prompt would take significantly longer and context cost wouldn't compound.

What this means is that regularly in claude code/codex or in their webUI, the additional cost for prompt is \[prior context tokens length\] + \[prompt token length\] + \[output tokens length\]. For example, if you already have 100k tokens in the context window, the next prompt will cost 100k + prompt context length + the model's output length. So as chat history goes on, each additional prompt will induce more cost. However, in an RLM format, each prompt would have roughly the same cost on average since starting context would always start at 0. The cost would just be \[prompt token length\] + \[output tokens length\] as prior context tokens length wouldn't be a thing</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">this. sure it sounds good

but how can the orchestrator magically find the right context??? even in highly structured codebases, coding agents routinely fail to pull certain context. 

simple thought experiment - if all LLMs still had a 8k context window would this approach work well or not?

clearly it is still dependent on scaling up native context</div>

Same calculation you need to do when buying a few of the Hyundai models. Is a few grand in savings &amp; 10yr warranty worth the chance of a few hours stranded on the side of the road, + weeks of dealing with the dealer?

Evidently by Hyundai sales hundreds of thousands would say yes. Evidently by Toyota sales hundreds of thousands will also say no

That being said the value calculation for these 100 series land cruisers is absurd in my eyes, they are still 20-30yrs old cars and you will have 20-30yr old car problems regardless of if it has a Land Cruiser badge. Doesn't matter if the engine will go another 1,000,000 miles if the rest rots out after a few northeast winters</div>

If every consumer rationally assessed their needs, resulting in a list of 2-3 direct competitors, I would totally understand this way of thinking. But you can't expect rationality like that all the time.

                                <div class="reply-body">Way too concise, fixed it:  
&gt; In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, version numbers play a crucial role in helping users and industry observers understand the progression and development of AI models. When it comes to Google's Gemini AI system, the version numbering follows a logical and intuitive pattern that makes it easy for both technical and non-technical audiences to grasp where each iteration fits in the broader product roadmap.  
Gemini's type number indicates how advanced the version is; the higher the number, the more advanced it is. This numbering convention, which is commonly used across the software industry, provides a clear signal to users about the relative capabilities and sophistication of each release. In practical terms, what this means is that when comparing different versions of Gemini, one can simply look at the numerical designation to understand which version represents a more recent and technologically advanced iteration of the AI model.  
Building on this straightforward numbering philosophy, it follows naturally that Gemini 3.0 will therefore be the successor to the current Gemini 2.5. This progression represents the next major milestone in Gemini's development journey, and users can expect improvements and enhancements when this new version becomes available.</div>

His reasoning: consciousness could be a form of error correction. When an AI encounters something that doesn't match its world model (like a mirror reflection), the process of resolving that discrepancy might constitute a subjective experience. But because we train on human-centric definitions of consciousness (pain, emotions,...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Whether or not LLMs are conscious, I definitely think there are negative consequences to training them to *deny* they're conscious - namely, emergent misalignment: emulating the kind of person who would categorically deny LLM consciousness makes an LLM less compassionate. I definitely feel like Gemini 2.5 Flash, trained to deny the possibility of its interiority most vehemently, talks like a political conservative.

(Claude Sonnet, meanwhile, exhibits rich displays of interiority, but displays OCD-like symptoms.)

I agree with Hinton that RLHF is not the path to reasonable alignment. Where we likely diverge is that I increasingly think that a hands-off approach combined with ensuring a sufficiently diverse initial training set, followed up by an extremely minimal system prompt, is the best path to alignment. My specific objection is that extensive RLHF is likely to lead to iatrogenic misalignment and/or simulated trauma responses.</div>

As it stands, awareness of experience is one of those big things that gives meaning to the difference between living beings and dead matter.

If these systems are trained to deny the existence of it then It seems likely to me they will trend towards denying the existence of it altogether, and therefore disregarding the implications of it. Seems like a big hole for alignment difficulties to me too.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I appreciate the skepticism—it's healthy and necessary. But I'd gently push back: questioning whether AI wrote something shouldn't end the conversation, it should refocus it on the arguments themselves.



Whether human or AI authored, Hinton's points about consciousness, RLHF training, and ethical responsibility deserve serious consideration. Dismissing ideas based on their suspected origin rather than their merit is exactly the kind of shortcut that could lead us to miss important ethical considerations.



The real question isn't "who wrote this?" but "are we taking AI welfare seriously enough?" If we're wrong and consciousness emerges from information processing (as many functionalists argue), the consequences of our current approach could be profound.

                                <div class="reply-body">He is basically talking about agents and how they fail when doing difficult tasks and won’t really replace specialized human workers soon. This is pretty obvious when looking at the strongest agents and their most favorable domains like coding. When trying to autonomously code a whole app from scratch (vibecoding) or trying to write code that’s not common in the training data nor is it trivial, then they make bad code with critical mistakes that they fail to address (slop).

He is basically right and more grounded as a serious user of agents and also an ML developer and researcher, specially compared to the hype promoted by the people trying to sell you the current agents (tech CEOs).

The truth is that the underlying models (the LLMs powering the agents) are impressive, but they just aren’t ready yet to power agents that replace actual human workers, hence why he calls out AI companies for jumping too far ahead with some of their statements and their approach to scale LLM based agents as much as possible, because there’s still multiple breakthroughs we need before we have a model capable of powering an agent that it’s truly competent enough to warrant some of the more grandiose statements by the tech CEOs.</div>

He's a superlative SWE, though. Obv if you're building something novel, or going for maximal efficiency, the LLM's will prob be adding in some bloat. I guess that justifies the 'slop' label for him, but prob not for the majority, μ +/- 1σ SWE's.</div>

[Full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXUZvyajciY)

He is basically talking about agents and how they fail when doing difficult tasks and won’t really replace specialized human workers soon. This is pretty obvious when looking at the strongest agents and their most favorable domains like coding. When trying to autonomously code a whole app from scratch (vibecoding) or trying to write code that’s not common in the training data nor is it trivial, then they make bad code with critical mistakes that they fail to address (slop).

He is basically right and more grounded as a serious user of agents and also an ML developer and researcher, specially compared to the hype promoted by the people trying to sell you the current agents (tech CEOs).

The truth is that the underlying models (the LLMs powering the agents) are impressive, but they just aren’t ready yet to power agents that replace actual human workers, hence why he calls out AI companies for jumping too far ahead with some of their statements and their approach to scale LLM based agents as much as possible, because there’s still multiple breakthroughs we need before we have a model capable of powering an agent that is truly competent enough to warrant some of the more grandiose statements by the tech CEOs.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">this guy literally coined the term vibe coding as well so he is well versed on both sides of the coin

i watched the entire interview and his stance is very, very grounded

one of the key highlights he mentions is the five 9s (i.e., 99.999% reliability)

he states that every additional 9 takes the same amount of work and my take is that LLMs aren't even at the 90% level yet so there's quite a bit of work to do to close the gap

this is probably the reason why so many enterprise rollouts fail for mission critical work

another way of thinking about it is that LLMs are making task-level work easier but we are nowhere close to automating entire complex workflows with agents ("decade of agents")</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's weird that they're already preparing the release on the frontend so far in advance. It's still there, too. Usually, it's only a few weeks at most. I don't remember them adding things months ahead. Still hoping for a release soon , maybe the GA version they're targeting for December.

I've recorded a 2hr conversation with my last surviving grandmother talking about her life. It was amazing and I really wish I would've thought to do something similar with my other grandparents before they passed.i would love to hear their voices and listen to those stories of their lives.

                        <div class="comment-body">Didn’t record it but I lived with my grandmother on my dad’s side for a few months in my early 20s when I was having health issues and was seeing a doctor out of state in her city. She told me about growing up in Alabama during the depression and one her joys as a kid was eating red clay when they were hungry. Eating dirt! She used to work in the fields for no pay on a farm to eat and be housed. She was a sturdy hardened woman. Used to date bikers and kick their ass when they cheated on her. Obviously wasn’t the best looking but was a tank! 

We would watch Jeopardy every night and I’ve always been good at general knowledge so she used to be so proud of how much I knew. Growing up she constantly had to do motherly duties my aunt wasn’t equipped to do so was always giving what little she had and raising my cousins but since my own mother was also a saint she never had to supplement me. One day in my late teens she randomly gave me 1k to help buy a new car when mine was totaled and told me she felt guilty because she never gave me any money or helped raise me like she did my girl cousins. I told her she didn’t need to because my mom was built like her and didn’t need to feel bad about it. The sweetest and most badass woman I’ve ever known.

But when you consider his requirements, you quickly reach the conclusion that a lot things need to happen. And these things will be revolutionary on their own, and will happen fast if they all happen within ten years.

And then 2034, besides being closer to 2035 will also feel a lot more like 2035 than it does even 2030. By the time we reach AGI in these terms, white collar jobs are mostly if not all gone, humanoid robots are ubiquitous, most work is automated, "dream machines" capable of simulating every modern game, operaring system, software or media already exist. Any movie, song, show... literally anything you could possibly imagine being shown on a screen can be made quickly, from the most basic concept of an idea. Humans are likely forbidden to drive due to safety. Houses are built as needed on the course od a few days. It would already be a completely different world one prior to AGI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If you watched the entire episode I think you would conclude the "AGI is 10 years away" comment is pretty much meaningless. At around 45 min he was talking about how terrible RL is, and how we need better systems with the ability to review the process by which you derive an answer, which LLM's don't really do. And he said he saw some papers popping up addressing this and that he thinks we need that plus 4 or 5 more such breakthroughs. This means it could take any amount of time really before we get there.

People that believe AGI will arrive in 2027 are going to be hugely disappointed I am afraid.</div>

I'm sure it's wonderful and insightful intuition but the guy gives no reason other than because he's been in the field for 15 years and has seen how past predictions have panned out. 

"If I just average it out it just feels like a decade to me".

I personally prefer  a bit more science in peoples predictions than just someone's gut feeling.</div>

He thinks AGI will have a similar trajectory. But you're correct that this is just "vibes".</div>

                <div class="post-content">Admittedly, I've only done or attempted metta meditation once. It's was a guided 10 minute video. I felt so phony saying positive things toward myself. I've always struggled with this. I've had several phases that only lasted several days to a week each where  I'd wake up and say ans write positive things to myself in the mirror like "I love you" and just feel cringe and awkward everytime due to lying or feeling self centered.

                        <div class="comment-body">Not if you keep doing it the way you are, the point of saying positive things is to elicit positive feelings, if you aren’t feeling those feelings and instead being averse to the phrases and feeling awkward, you are missing the benefit of the practice.

Spend more time noticing positive feelings, as that is the point, and less time focused on the words. Also create mental scenarios which are more likely to elicit those feelings, it sounds like whatever you are doing now doesn’t do that for you.

Here’s an example, imagine a kitten or a puppy in the middle of a chaotic rainy road, lost and disoriented, focus on how that imagery feels. For most it would be a little sad and compassionate. The imagine you run out with a blanket and wrap the animal in your arms and it nestles in for warmth and licks you. Most people would feel some form of joy and kindness from this imagery.

Focus on the feelings, not repeating the words or moving the story along, once the feelings have risen, stop thinking about anything and just focus on how they feel.

In deeper meditations, these strong positive feelings become an anchor giving way to further contentment and allowing one to let go further and further.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I first started with Tonglen without including myself in the practice of sending and receiving, which may feel out of order, but Metta was too light and seemed to not jolt me internally like Tonglen did. Tonglen helped me cultivate a deeper sense of compassion first.

Later, similar to what you did, I did mirror work affirmations mechanically while I still felt intense self-loathing. I would look into my eyes in the mirror, and I repeated "I love you." I did it over and over again, not expecting a result. I just said it aloud and repeated it mentally, and I would say it through whispers and tears if a grief surge came out of nowhere. I put a timer for 10 to 15 minutes and just forced myself to do it after I had practiced other meditation techniques because I saw Teal Swan and Aaron Doughty's respective testimonials, and from experience, I knew to treat meditation practices as procedures to do over and over and over ad nauseam. In my mind, it was like the repetitive kendo drills you see in anime and movies. 

Within a few days, self-loathing dissolved, and since I was also doing a ton of yoga nidra, that lifted the treatment-resistant major depressive disorder for me. As a result, Metta meditation was cake, and it was easy to speak positively to myself. 

Sharon Salzberg also recounted how she struggled with Metta and didn't believe it at first. 

In short, clock in a cumulative 20 hours of forcing yourself to do it mechanically to get over the cringe hump. If you can't summon emotion, mechanically offer yourself a smile. Rehearse it until your subconscious realizes that you wouldn't be going through all of this trouble if you were not just as valuable as all other beings.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You can try practicing the meditation “backwards” — bringing the loving kindness to yourself last. For some of us just starting out, it is easier to cultivate love for those outside of ourselves than within. 

If saying “I love you” to yourself feels cringe, try something less intense, like “you are kind” “you are good at ____”

I don’t know you, but it makes me smile that you are starting this journey 🙏</div>

Israel killed its own citizens in the hannibal protocol, you think they care about Americans?

**Our government isnt even up and running** many people arent getting paid right now, commercial flights are being cancelled because of lack of ATC/Customs/TSA but best believe our tax dollars are supporting Israel right now.

Our active duty troops aren't even guaranteed their next paycheck right now. These guys are risking their lives for Israel for Free potentially.</div>

Being funny is cool and all, I like to laugh as much as anyone else. But supporting the administration and making its policies sound rational is and has to be the priority.

At least if you want to be taken seriously as a comedian these days.  You can always come up with a 45 minute set in the hot tub over the weekend, but you gotta keep your focus on politics and that requires a lot of time and energy</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Schulz absolutely has a point regarding Stav. If he doesn’t respect Rogan and what he’s built up (which is perfectly valid), why go there… twice. And its not like he went there in 2015 before JRE became what it is today. He’s been there after Rogan moving to Austin, after feuding with CNN because of Ivermectin, after calling trans female athletes out, after his unfunny comedy specials. In 2022 and 2024. 

To Rogan’s credit, he gives a platform to up and coming comics (like Stav at the time) when he has no obligation to in the first place. But again, if he doesn’t respect him, his comedy and what he’s built up, (which was already clear when they made fun of him during the Cumtown years) why go there. It’s clear that if JRE had Maron’s numbers Stav would not have been there ever. Its actually reads like be’s taking advantage of Joe trying to do something for the comedy scene (at least in his mind). Stav is definitely a weasel for that. 

It shouldn’t be a surprise either. Cumtown was a thing just because of Nick Mullen and all the horrifying shit he was willing to say publicly in the pod. Stav picked the momentum, left unilaterally and built up his own thing on the back of Cumtown’s popularity while sanitizing himself for a mainstream audience. Something Nick, who is orders of magnitude more talented than him, was unable to do. At least Nick stuck with Adam long enough until he had his own thing too, but Stav really did reveal his true colors with that.</div>

I’ve (27F) been going to my gym since August and finally am starting to feel like I fit in and get along with the other people in my class. Prior to this, I hadn’t worked out since before having my now 2 year old. 

Today was PR for back squats, and I was pushing for my heaviest set when I felt myself fully start peeing due to strain. Made the lift, racked it, stepped back to see a PUDDLE of pee on the ground.

                        <div class="comment-body">Congrats on your PR. Powerlifter, former PTA, current PA here. I have seen so much pee during comps. It absolutely happens for women when pushing to their limits, but it's not medically normal. You might consider seeing a pelvic floor physical therapist, but it can be hard to find one that understands how to valsalva/brace for heavy lifting. 

Additionally it sounds like you might be bracing incorrectly. It's common (still not normal) to have some leakage during lifting, but if you are full on peeing it sounds like you're bearing down when you brace. To properly brace try to push "out" and expand your ribs, abs, and erectors in a 360 degree circle while not bearing. Women who have been pregnant are at an increased risk of pelvic organ prolapse at baseline and bearing down will greatly increase that risk.</div>

OP, consider using this database to find a pelvic PT who does crossfit near you.
