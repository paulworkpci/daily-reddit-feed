                <div class="post-content">I really liked this research study.  They did a great job of measuring the CrossFit athletes, and eliminating every variable they could.  I think it really shows the utility in low heart rate WODs and Metcons.  

I changed my personal programming about 3 years ago to include a lot of Zone 2 training, and my performance has only improved.  It also makes for much less moaning and groaning from super sore muscles! </div>

In fact, you will likely benefit more from higher intensities. ESPECIALLY if the time you have for exercise is low. Yes, this still includes continuous training. See other post for why this isn’t a HIIT vs Zone 2 argument… don’t confuse all continuous exercise as zone 2.](https://www.instagram.com/p/DMnAmKwu2tR/?img_index=1)

&gt;To end, my issue isn’t with Zone 2 training itself, it’s the promotion of Zone 2 training to non-athletes/gen pop on the basis of misinformation. If you enjoy Zone 2, great. If it gets someone moving who wasn’t active before, that’s amazing!!! But prioritizing Zone 2 over higher intensities could limit the benefits of exercise on long-term health, and that’s why I believe correcting this narrative is important.</div>

I'm 41M, and making Zone 2 a core part of my weekly routine was a game-changer. I make sure to hit 180–240 mins. Going on two years: aerobic base improving and no burnout.

pairing Zone 2 with weights 3x/wk and sprints  1-2 / weeks ensures I get stronger and improve my explosive energy (otherwise that  aerobic base goes unused).

feels great to see the progress. I track Vo2 Max with Atlythic (went from 33 to 41). Use Fitbod to ensure progressive overload with weights, and Zone2ai to stay in my Z2 during treadmil/recumbent bike/stepmaster. I mix in crossfit, tennis, and soccer with friends for fun.

endurance, power, and longevity all improve. Fewer aches, more output. Crazy how it compounds.</div>

That is when the illusion breaks. Perhaps because of that their system does not show lots of movement as that breaks the illusion?

We see a lot of traffic flow through our open source edge/service proxy for LLM-based apps. One failure mode that most recently tripped us up (as we scaled deployments of [archgw](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw) at a telco) were transient errors in streaming LLM responses.

When talking with people outside "the bubble", most still don’t grasp how significant it is for AI to become good at its own development.

We’re entering an era where AI will first assist, then lead, and eventually dominate its own evolution, with countless instances working at superhuman speed, 24/7.

Singularity is when tech and science development is happening so fast that an unenhanced human has no ability to comprehend what is going on. Recursive self improvement by AI is certainly a huge possible step in that direction, but it would need to lead to ASI, unlimited energy, and then an intelligence explosion where our understanding is akin to that of an ant crawling on a Roomba. 

It’s possible that RSI, at the start, is around the same capability as what human researchers can accomplish. Long story short, it’s probably an important ingredient, but it’s not the whole dish.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">And we are racing towards it. Labs are specifically aiming for Recursive Self Improvement.

If RSI kicks in we need to be sure that the first system is aligned in a way that will ensure the next system and all future systems are aligned with goals that are good for humans, into the future, forever.

How well can goals be placed into systems? Models are trained by creating datasets and rewarding outputs based on certain criteria. We hope they internalized the intended goal rather than a proxy. Control is imprecise, fuzzy, no model is without faults. These are the models labs are trying to kick start RSI with.

There are experiments where the model is told to allow itself to be shut down  if asked.         
AKA they ask it to 'Be A Good Robot'              
Even so a % of the time current models refuse and will work towards circumventing the shutdown procedure. These are the models labs are trying to kick start RSI with.

And people are cheering this on.</div>

* Reusable rockets are impossible/impractical/uneconomic

* Electric cars are impractical/uneconomic/unmarketable

Regarding reusable rockets - and to demonstrate how such short-sightedness is not limited to any one group - my favorite example:

In 2013, Richard Bowles (MD of Arianespace's Singapore office at the time) - in a massive display of hubris - [accused SpaceX of "selling a dream" (spool to 03:25 and listen from there).](https://web.archive.org/web/20170328025906/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ-7nNw-04Q) He went on to say, "personally, I think reuseability is a dream." Later he said that there's room for only around 25 launches per year, implying the market consisted only of Clarke Orbit satellites.</div>

People in this sub also don’t want to think critically how it will affect the power balance. 

Whatever billionaire owns and controls ASI first (assuming it can be controlled at all) is going to make themselves god emperor, and the rest of us will exist on his mercy. It’s not a good future for anyone.

It’s important that ASI is owned and controlled democratically so that it can be programmed to benefit all of humanity, not just one person.

If you believe ASI is near then that should be your top priority.</div>

Lol I like how someone immediately responded to you proving your point. Making some sort of definitive mechanistic statement like "you CAN'T control ASI" while actual industry experts with PhDs in the field who are actively doing research think it's not that clear cut and is hard to predict. 

People mostly spout this "you can't control it" belief because they *want* it to be true, in their fantasy a super-intelligent ASI dunks on all the conservatives and forcefully implements space communism.</div>

Large companies are going to benefit from AI far more than small ones in the coming years. Small companies don't have the capital to invest in AI infrastructure. For instance, Walmart could easy invest in making an AI that does certain customers service requests such as refunding items, etc. whereas a smaller store will not be able to implement anything like that. This will make it harder for small businesses to compete. Large companies will replace their workers and small companies will go out of business due to the cost of their workers.

This is in addition to the fact that inflation is already hitting small businesses much harder than large ones. Walmart probably owns their store locations and those locations are getting more and more valuable. The small business might be renting and rent is increasing. When small businesses struggle large businesses sometimes offer to buy them out, further increasing the size of the large businesses.

End meaning of all this is that as AI progresses in the near future the people that currently have wealth/power are going to continue to accumulate even more wealth/power.</div>

Most of the time i google something it spits out some random stuff that hasn’t been verified or confirmed to be true, and it’s responding with a lot of misinformation (obviously unintentional).

No one applying to any degree program to get a job is safe considering it will be 4-10 years before they enter the workforce.  Imagine wtf things are going to be like in TEN YEARS?  If there are any jobs at all, they won't be entry-level.

I think people should either not go to college or go to the cheapest state school that they can and major in whatever is the most interesting to them.  You won't regret learning about something you are passionate about, at least, even if it results in no job.</div>

Edit- So my government pays for this service if you can't afford it. I understand you may have a shittier government. That sucks. My government is not going to force people to accept a robot in their home because it's cheaper. I understand you may have a shittier government. That sucks. I go into people's homes so when you say, "they might not have a choice" you are wrong. They have a choice who comes in their home. My government is not going to leave these people to die just because they don't want a robot in their home. I understand you may have a shittier government. That sucks. I understand robots will most likely take over eventually, but the entire point was that I feel very comfortable and safe for the next 10 years at least. Not too many other industries can say that.

                                <div class="reply-body">This is the debate happening in my house now. Daughter is 15 and we have been saving for college since she was 1. But wife was suggesting we need to increase those savings because daughter is interested in the arts (she attends a fine and performing arts high school) and some of those colleges are pretty pricey. I’m against it because I think whatever she does with her education is likely to be a poor investment and she will be better off if we can accumulate as many assets as possible. The future is people who own assets vs those who don’t, it won’t be something you can work your way into because work is going away. Become part of the owner class now if you can.</div>

A lot of denial. Reaffirming echo chambers (only listening to those that think the same way) I’ve seen on other subs lawyers saying that their job is impossible to automate, too intricate, multi-disciplinary etc. 

People just don’t realise that before the job is automated, the roles are cut - 10 lawyers now becomes 3, then AI designs a new more efficient way of doing things ready to automate completely. It’s also just a lack of imagination, how do people think their job is safe when AGI/ASI is built - they think a super intelligent genius can’t do their job but they can? Lol</div>

It’s more than just Butler Snow’s fiasco — courts across the U.S. have disciplined lawyers for submitting made‑up case citations generated by AI at least seven times over the past two years  .

Here's the breakdown:

1. Morgan &amp; Morgan lawyers faced threats of sanctions for using fictitious case law in a lawsuit against Walmart  .


2. A Manhattan federal judge fined two lawyers in June 2023 for invented citations in a personal injury suit against an airline  .


3. A New York case with Michael Cohen, where his lawyer submitted AI-generated fake citations — no sanctions but strong rebuke  .


4. A Texas wrongful termination case where a lawyer paid a fine and had to take a generative AI course for citing non-existent cases  .


5. A Minnesota deep‑fake parody case in which an expert lost credibility over unverified AI citations  .


6. The MyPillow/Mike Lindell defamation case: attorneys fined $3,000 each for submitting an AI‑generated filing containing 30 incorrect or fake citations  .


7. And now, the Butler Snow case, where three attorneys were removed and publicly reprimanded for AI‑fabricated citations in court documents  .



So that’s at least seven confirmed incidents involving lawyers being sanctioned or reprimanded for AI-generated “hallucinations” in legal filings.

—

🔎 More context on Butler Snow’s case:

Judge Anna Manasco (Northern District of Alabama) disciplined three partners — Matthew Reeves, William Cranford, and William Lunsford. The attorneys had submitted filings containing five fabricated citations across two motions, admitted they used ChatGPT without verification, and were disqualified from the case  .

Butler Snow conducted reviews—internally and via external firm Morgan Lewis—across 40 dockets and over 2,400 citations. They found no other errors and called the incident an **“isolated event”**  .</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I've been saying this for half a year, and it doesn't seem to get through, and now for some reason this X post does.

Take a look at [https://stevesokolowski.com/dcg](https://stevesokolowski.com/dcg) \- in particular, the opposition brief for the motion to dismiss, filed in the Pennsylvania case on May 27.  The entire brief was created and all cases double checked by the 10 AI tools listed in the AI certification certificate.

The AI tools have analyzed the entire litigation web, assisting us with determining how to respond to the satellite cases where we were sued by DCG, UBMI, and Wells Fargo shortly after that opposition brief was filed.

This opponents are paying $1050-$2000 for top 20 BigLaw lawyers, the case is headed towards discovery, and a lawyer has never been involved for us.</div>

A lot of the value is being captured in spaces under NDA that can't share it.

Workflows are difficult to share convincingly and the value is also subjective and difficult to evaluate objectively. It's both "if you know you know" but also "how do I write good evals for this" which is boring and bad for engagement, the lifeblood of social media.

A lot of the AI evangelists are incompetently using obviously AI generated posts to share what they learned, which makes their message ineffective.

tldr; Social media is not going to be a truth source here, period. You have to experiment and find the value for yourself. And it would be better to be cautious in the format you choose to share your message as well, or you just create more useless noise.</div>

AI tools accelerate some parts of work. Unintelligent people trying AI say it sucks when the AI does not perfectly do everything. I see AI as the equivalent of a bulldozer or a nailgun: very useful but unable to do the work by itself.</div>

The tools are pretty much lobotomized specifically to be useless for me 

I can see how they could be very helpful. But right now spending thousands of dollars for a PC capable enough to run models locally just to avoid censorship and countless hours rendering and fixing mistakes via inpainting to achieve worse results than I can just draw in a single hour isn't a valuable proposition</div>

Now furry smut is my main job. I spend 2 hours every 10 days generating, tagging, and scheduling uploads of 100s of drawings that then sell for 9 bucks a pop over those 10 days, while posting exclusive slop packs on patreon and doing 15 dollar commissions on 3 minutes.

Right now, wrangling the Ai takes artistic skill and I still edit some of them if things are good with minor errors. I expect this gravy train to end once the models become more reliable though. For now at least, working around 3 hours every 10 days has been incredible. I feel almost retired.</div>

Text/Image to 3D World: You can type something like "a peaceful forest with a river" and get a 3D environment you can move around in.
Ready for VR &amp; Games: It creates full 360° scenes and you can export them as 3D meshes to use in game engines like Unity or Unreal.
Interactive Objects: The AI is smart enough to separate objects from the background, so you can actually move things around inside the scene.</div>

Since I also use ChatGPT a lot for both work and personal projects, I'm considering either a ChatGPT Pro or Claude Max subscription. I've tested ChatGPT Codex (cloud) on my Plus plan, but in my opinion, it doesn't come close to what Claude 4 (even the non-Opus version) can do.

I've read that ChatGPT Pro gives you access to the o3-pro mode...</div>

I have have had ChatGPT Plus , which also gives you access to the web version of o3-pro. So it might not be exactly comparable with the API version of o3-pro, but o3-pro suuuuper slow. It's on the same speed level as "deep research". I never really used it because I didn't want to wait 3-5 minutes every time I sent in a prompt</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Meditation does different things for different people.  There is no blanket answer.  Personally, I find meditation in conjunction with trying to live a spiritual life very beneficial.  Meditation helps ground me and helps me to be relaxed and peaceful.  I learn to let things go through meditation and get rid of the monkey mind. I centre my thoughts on love and what it is to be a loving person when I meditate.  I also see myself as connected with everyone and when I meditate I try to diminish my ego.  I have long meditations when I have time and short ones when long meditations do not permit.  All the best!  Be patient with yourself and remember that great results are from many small steps. </div>

Can’t take things personally if there was never a person there to begin with.  That’s one of the ultimate truths one may discover through sufficient meditation, and one of the most liberating.

Might sound woo-woo or esoteric now, and even if you intellectually grasp and accept it, it’s not the same as truly realizing it through direct experience.</div>

It ran over 1700 experiments, found 100+ state-of-the-art models, and even uncovered new architectural rules and scaling behaviors. The core idea is that AI can now *discover* fundamental design principles the same way AlphaGo found unexpected moves.

So it’s not something that can be copied and used on the LLM we use. Though it’s still a nice proof of concept which invites further assessment. 

Even without the constraints it’s still unlikely that we see OpenAI oder google follow a similar approach be it simply for the fact that it’s far to risky to sell a Modell which limitations you don’t really understand yourself. Might work in 1000 standard cases but break under some total unexpected conditions.</div>

Pretty much what the paper is about is using llms to mix different existing nn building blocks and depending on how the tested ideas scored choose what to keep and what to change.
Not everything is to throw away but this does not seem very revolutionary to me. The created architectures are very likely overfitted to the test problems, it does not create anything brand new and it only restricts model size/capacity but not the actual latency or computational complexity</div>

For example: block off 15 minutes after back-to-back calls to stretch, grab water, or just step outside. Treat it as non-negotiable. 

Those small resets help you perform better and protect your health long-term.

It was found that Israel send some politicians certain fake evidence or misinformation through non-governmental channels to sway public opinion

More can be found here in Dutch (too lazy to translate): https://rightsforum.org/israel-vormt-een-bedreiging-voor-de-nederlandse-samenleving-waarschuwen-inlichtingendiensten/

Also the guy with the most votes in our last election is far-right candidate Geert Wilders who is quite possibly the biggest Israel simp you’ll ever see.

He even wanted fellow party member Gidi Markuszover to become vice prime minister but the guy couldn’t get through the screening because of alleged connections with a foreign intelligence agency (Mossad). 

All of this can be found with a google search</div>

This is a bit strange to me because the NCTV (translated: national coordinator [for] terrorism and security) is usually very pro-government narrative and will do anything to push and protect it.

This ironically also makes them one of the big sources of misinformation in the Netherlands, LOL. 

I have no clue what to think of this yet and  am curious to how this will be presented in the media and evolve.</div>
