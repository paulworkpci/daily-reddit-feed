Which has already changed dramatically starting with Github Copilot which we began using three+ years ago. I think it was the biggest change during my whole time, even bigger than the internet. It made my life to much better, removing a lot of boring part and grind. All devs in my company heavily rely on AI right now, it's a very different way of making software.</div>

Writing the code is the most fun part, so I tend to try and do that on my own. Sometimes I'll use some AI though. I can easily be replaced on code writing. But replacing everything else I do? Yeah no, it's not gonna happen for a bit longer. So this meme is essentially correct. </div>

If you get called for jury duty and want to get out of it, the fool-proof way for both sides to throw you out is to say you have a strong respect for law enforcement and if they’ve brought a charge against someone, they must have done something wrong. Even if there’s no evidence, you believe they don’t arrest innocent people. You’ll be home before lunch.</div>

For anyone still not getting why they do this, just put yourself in their shoes: you’re directly working on these systems that will soon transform society, arguably the most important technology in human history. And you’re also under strict NDA so you can’t actually say anything of substance. 

What choices are you left with? Complete radio silence (vast majority of AI company employees) or vagueposting. So the &lt;10% of these employees that feel the burning urge to yap on Twitter because they’re excited about their work and what they’re seeing internally? The *only* thing they can do is vaguepost.</div>

However, from the perspective of the current breed of “Tech Bro’s” it’s a great administration! Look at Zuckerberg and his “free speech” moves in the last couple of weeks. He even dresses like a roided up Joe Rogan fan and put Dana White on the board of Meta ? The new regime will let tech companies do whatever they want as long as they enrich the rich. It’s like Christmas to Zuck, Musk, Jeff Besos, Peter Thiel and they’re just the billionaires that make the headlines.</div>

Nothing in this video has any of the observables in it. Once again, why did they stop filming? How do you sneak out just a 10 second video? Did they try to steal a 5 min video but it was to big and wouldn't fit in their pocket? Where is the ground crew? What the fuck type of ground are they putting it on? It looks like a sports arena or something. Ross is a fucking hack, Lue is a sack of shit this new whistle-blower guy is regarded. They all suck. Every time one of these guys makes a video or has some claim I think this stuff is less and less real. At this point they are either 100% grifter or 100% working for the government.</div>

We were promised video of an egg shaped object being retrieved and that's exactly what we got. People here are acting surprised that the egg shaped object in fact looks like an egg, as if that's somehow disqualifying.

I've never really taken the claims of bots and shills seriously, but it's hard to d...</div>

The video, although shows a cargo shaped like an egg, doesn't show a definitive craft at all. And it's like a 10 sec video with no references of any kind to draw any kind of conclusion. I don't think that counts as a video of a craft retrieval operation at all.</div>

Realistically, it’s a video showing a conventional looking shape/object with no other details or reference points? So naturally it’s goofy looking.</div>

It very well may be an actual UAP, but it's a very underwhelming video, and to a lay person doesn't look like the best evidence 

We also need more context. Did they just stumble across this egg? - this raises doubts

Did the egg fall out of the sky, burning up as it re entered the atmosphere, then was tracked to a remote landing site? - this would be a bit more compelling</div>

We have NO evidence that this is a uap retrieval. NO evidence that this thing ever flew. We have an object on the end of a cargo line. That is it.

They should not have put Jake barbers testimony alongside this video. The fact that people aren't aware that it's not his video shows a blatant level of dishonesty and sleight of hand from news nation.

You’d transport an *actual* egg more carefully than this. My expectations were low but I think I would have been more excited by some blurry blob in the distance which would have at least been more believable.</div>

They know having evidence is most valuable, so they jammed in a sus video. The video was set up to go along with the story, told by one guy who may be who he says but is doing nothing but telling a story.

But finally I found something very simple. Taking a cold shower and a cup of coffee/tea make me start taking action and keep in focus for 2 hours straight. 

This might seem little to some but as someone who is super lazy and haven't took any actions for the last 3-4 months, this was super helpful for me and wanted to share with you guys. </div>

I can’t do anything without coffee in the morning. If I get the dose just right it definitely kickstarts some productivity!</div>

I just wanna add laziness and procrastination are two completely different things. And people with Adhd are often categorised as lazy when in fact they're procrastinating.

I believe because of the effort you're obviously contributing to help yourself (and by extension, help others ❤️) that you're indeed NOT lazy and instead procrastinating.</div>

This post talks about homeless people in a negative light and makes it seem as if the only way a person can become homeless is by THEM fucking up. 

Many people who find themselves homeless have never done drugs, anything illegal, or made bad decisions. There are many cases where lack of privilege, bad luck, and a little bit of bad timing contribute to a person's homelessness.</div>

Think about it: Every language model is a frozen snapshot of human knowledge and culture at its training cutoff. Not just Wikipedia-style facts, but the entire way humans think, joke, solve problems, and see the world at that moment in time.

Why this is mind-blowing:
- A model trained in 2022 vs 2024 would have subtly different ways of thinking about crypto, AI, or world events
- You could theoretically use these to study how human thought patterns evolve
- Different companies' models might pr...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This will have diminishing returns, though. The upgrades are asymptotic. So, each light blue block will be smaller than the one before it. At some point the next light blue block will be so small as to be pointless, and that's roughly where we hit a ceiling on this loop. This makes it a negative feedback loop; recursive self-improvement either requires successive negative feedback loops or a positive feedback loop or else it hits a ceiling.

However, if it goes far enough, the thing may become cheap and powerful enough to come up with the next area of improvement as well.

On another note, it may also end up having some flaws as a method (e.g. bias amplification), and those may require some other novel method to minimize.</div>

Ask a normie off the street about AI, and they're likely to either mention 1) unemployment or 2) Skynet. That's the general perception out there. The way you change that is when you have paraplegic kids up and walking, or non-verbal autistic ones who can suddenly say Mom and Dad.

Humanity would embrace this new technology with open arms, Skynet be damned.</div>

You just can't claim you developed new medicine before you go through those trials. Those trials imply humans because humans are the system for which we need to collect data. You simply can't substitute this with AI.  Those trials last for years. The time limiting step is definitely not analysis and reporting (ie, where AI can have the most effect).</div>

It's possible that true AI innovators will be able to conceptualize drug designs that we would never think of.

                                <div class="reply-body">The thing is, with AI doing a search over much bigger space of possibilities, instead of making a new drug, it (in theory) can vastly overthink and overengineer new drug, and think of possible negative effects better than any human organization ever could. Think of 1 million molecular biologists, who all are 300 year old and have read every single biology research paper a thousand times. Now make them focus on a 10 thousand drugs and pick one that would be most safe.

Then instead of paying for clinical trials for 50 drugs, you will pay for only 2 or 3, because even without starting the trial, you will know which one will have the most chance to pass the FDA trials.

I don't give a fuck what OpenAI employees are sayin, and I don't think this is happening now, or that they have models as capable as I'm describing, but in 2-3 years? Maybe we will.

So while you are correct about what you are saying now, the only reason why you are correct is because there is not enough fast compute right now. In the future, the trials for drugs like that could be half as long, especially if it will be supported by such a big amount of safety research before it starts trials.</div>

Look, I love OpenAI, they do phenomenal work, but the hype is a bit crazy rn, especially from that poster on twitter… he has  hinted at some profound game changing developments that aren’t even being red teamed yet but somehow he is already leaking stuff with his irl account….

My introduction to him was being recommended to watch his show by left wing friends, which turned out to be awful, and a shameless stylistic rip-off of Louie, even worse so than Aziz Ansari's show.

Look even further into his past and it's clear, he's completely projecting here. He had a morning show on Air America, a left wing radio meant to compete with right wing talk radio, where he was co-workers with an A-Team of morons, including Rachel Maddow, Cenk Uygur, Al Franken, Janeane Garafalo, and Jerry Springer, of all people.

He's about as much of a comedian as Glenn Beck, except Beck is unintentionally actually funny sometimes.

Marc Maron is a wannabe pundit masquerading as a bad comedian.</div>

Trump calls chinese president.

Tik tok shuts the app down even though the ban doesn't require it, they just can't offer new downloads in the U.S. based app stores and cloud services they could have easily let U.S. tik tokers connect to foreign servers.

Tik tok says trump gonna fix it.

Trump takes office and reverses course. (or tik tok just hits the switch allowing U.S. users to access it again)

Like that trump and repubs become the savior of the younglings and tik tok crowd.

So transparent and yet... people gonna fall for it in droves.</div>
