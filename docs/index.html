Not to mention the major benefits of this don't seem to be relevant to ai. There is a speed improvment at higher usage rates but i don't know if that is a radical enough of a diffrence to make it worth it. The big plus of this technology is the fact it can be used as conventional storage because it doesn't require electricity to flow for it to retain information</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I remember the company I worked for working on magnetic 'bubble' memory at the end of the 70s. Little magnetic bubbles that circulated on a long train, IIRC. They wanted to use it for non-volatile program memory on their telephone systems, so they could update the software as new versions became available. At the time, EEPROMs were superexpensive and UVPROMS were difficult to work with. But ultimately, it was dropped because non-volatile semiconductor RAM became cheaper and faster.</div>

The much much longer essay goes into more details, but I think the argument being made here is intentionally distilled down to something that people won't quibble over, like exact dates.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This quip about extrapolating exponential trends has never made much sense when applied to AI. It's an apples and oranges comparison - something with clear limitations (weightlifting) and something without clear limitations (intelligence &amp; cognition).

Weightlifting has clear physical limits imposed by human physiology (muscle strength, bone density, etc.). In contrast, intelligence has no upper limit in principle. Cognitive capacity in AI systems can scale with computational resources, novel architectures, and algorithmic improvements. Every time researchers thought they might hit a wall, they got around it. Nowadays the space for potential improvements and optimizations is wide open.

EDIT: Even if you were to be pedantic and point out how something like the speed of light may limit information processing, you're missing the point. There's simply no clear indication that we're hitting a wall anytime soon with AI. This is fundamentally different than something like weightlifting which has obvious limitations.</div>

I'd hit the gym five days straight, then miss one workout and suddenly, I wouldn’t go back for two weeks. Same with reading, writing, or any other habit. One missed day turned into a full-on slump way too easily.

Then I found the 2-Day Rule, and it changed everything.

The rule is simple: never skip two days in a row.

If I miss a workout today, I have to go tomorrow.

If I don’t write today, I make sure to get words down...</div>

You also were originally on the ChatGPT board, and your posts appear formatted similarly, and are filled with rehashed advice and read inauthentically and polished. 

I’m genuinely interested - what are you getting out of posting advice which is clearly machine generated, and offers no actual insight from your own, true life and perspective? 

This is not an attack, I’m honestly fascinated by this approach that people are now having to posting on reddit self-improvement boards. Like, what is the end goal with this stuff?</div>

&gt; Our findings suggest that, similar to what is observed in substance and gambling addictions, the neural and behavioral mechanisms associated with the anticipatory processing of cues specifically predicting erotic rewards relate importantly to clinically relevant features of PPU. These findings suggest that PPU may represent a behavioral addiction and that interventions helpful in targeting behavioral and substance addictions warrant consideration for adaptation and use in helping men with PPU.

                <div class="post-content">Let’s see, what happened if i don’t use youtube for 10 days.
You guys must be thinking why only 10days. Because i don’t know if i can do it for more than 10 days😅. Lets start with small number.

It has already passed 2hrs and again and again i am searching for youtube in my phone’s search bar😂.

If i will pass the 10 days challenge. I will come again and tell you how it feels.

                        <div class="comment-body">It's so funny to me there's a book by Pete Etchells called *Unlocked: The Real Science of Screentime* in which he literally writes "You are not addicted to your smartphone", saying there's no agreed upon medical diagnosis for addiction... Meanwhile you are already putting Youtube in the searchbar after 2 hours... If that isn't some form of addiction I don't know what is. It will be hard to break but you've taken great steps, good for you!</div>

While the dates usually refer to retraining or some tuning.

Thid is why they make sense, even if they seem confusing or nonsensical.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The new V3 seems like a mix of reasoning model and normal model.

If you ask a math question or logic question it puts out very long reasoning answers even without asking a hard question.

Feels like it goes in the direction what OpenAI wants to do with GPT5. It certainly feels very different to old V3 model.

That is my first vibe test anyway without going to judge the quality yet.</div>

fwiw this has been the general sense of what direction this stuff has been going in for a while. It's my understanding the LLaMA 4 will also do thinking when it determines that it's required. After the latest Claude release, Anthropic has also said about as much.

Point being that this isn't an OpenAI thing, people just like looking at OpenAI more than others.</div>

JD Vance, Hegseth, Steven Miller, and others (including former guest, Tulsi Gabbard) then proceeded to discuss and plan, in detail, the attacks on the Houthis. 

Apparently with zero idea the journalist was in the group chat, and apparently with zero concern about using proper channels to discuss classified and national security materials.

Yes, exactly. Give it another 12-18 months and it'll be practically indistinguishable from real podcasters.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of these theories making the rounds... that the UFOs aren’t coming from deep space at all, but from right here, beneath us… the oceans.


And honestly, it makes sense. The logistics of staging an alien invasion from space would be impossible to pull off... too expensive, too hard to hide. But from the depths of the ocean? Much more believable, much easier to control.


Of course, the real twist is it’s all man-made... a carefully crafted illusion designed to stoke fear and tighten control. Just another chapter in the same old playbook.</div>

It seems like he's providing more information each time he sits down for interviews... as if he knows he doesn't have a whole lot of time to reveal what he truly knows to be fact.
