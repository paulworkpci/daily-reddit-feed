                        <div class="comment-body">Doesn’t matter what race you are. If you’re a father, and you beat your son and make him feel humiliated, he will develop a fear of humiliation, and will do anything, however drastic, to avoid feeling humiliated. 

That’s what I saw as I watched all the footage of this. A guy who was made to feel humiliated, and stewed in that anger and rage, and then was presented with an opportunity to maim the man he felt was responsible for his humiliation. 

When you humiliate your son, you’re creating a violent man.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm not violent at all, but my dad was like this. Enjoyed humiliating his family and making them feel afraid. I was lucky in that I had a terrific mom and a younger sister, but Rajas' mom died young, and he had no one else. He did what he did, and I'm not excusing it. He isn't a kid at 25; you're fully responsible for yourself and your own actions, but it's also hard for me not to sympathize with him somewhat. This kind of mistreatment breeds insecurity, resentment, and anger in your most formative years, and if there's no one else to influence you, I can see how someone might grow up to do something like this.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hello all,

I'm looking to gain some insight into what to expect in terms of limits for gpt 5 pro (high) and Codex CLI.

I'm currently on the claude max 20x plan and it was great when I first started using it a few months ago, but the past month it's been increasingly frustrating trying to get it to do what I want. Last night was the final straw when I asked it to make a relatively simple modification, and it ended up causing over 400 errors in my project in one response, and it took over 3 hour...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">hey, i work on codex: our intent is that just running in 1 terminal you should not hit usage limits on pro.

when we first launched using it with the pro plan we got reports of people hitting limits with that usage pattern, but since then we fixed a bunch of stuff and i think we're good. (there are still some straggling bugs like using MCP causing cache misses and thus higher token usage, but those are getting fixed gradually)

also, hitting limits with just 3 prompts on plus doesn't sound good either. we've heard some reports of that and are looking into it</div>

I've decided to try out the pro subscription for a month and see how it compares to CC.

Out of curiosity, does Codex CLI automatically use gpt-5 pro when subscribed? /status just shows model name: gpt-5 with reasoning effort: high, but this was the same thing I was seeing prior to updating my subscription. gpt-5 pro doesn't appear in the model list.</div>

Now, about codex cli, it should have lasted longer than 3 msg on plus, unless your repos is huge? I'm on pro, always run codex cli on high, and haven't run into limit. You should get the latest version of codex cli btw, it shouldn't run out of limit after 3 msgs, there was a bug before and they have fixed it.</div>

With the test I ran yesterday, I purposefully tried to be as vague as possible with the modification I asked gpt 5 to make as a way to test it.

I deleted all codex files that I had from months ago and installed from npm @ openai-codex I believe, not the original package that they had released it under.

Is gpt 5 pro greater than gpt 5 high? I've tried to find info on this, but I can't find much.</div>

Claude code has always done pretty good with navigating even just using grep and no MCP servers to handle better project navigation. Apparently, gpt 5 high is much more thorough, and the larger project size is costing me.

Either way, I wouldnt expect to be able to work with plus and plan to pay for the pro subscription. Just wondering if the limits are as generous as they make them out to be.</div>

                <div class="post-content">This one time, I was traveling by train at night. As it got late, I tried to sleep. But the man on the berth beside mine started snoring — not the kind you can shrug off, but the kind that keeps you wide awake no matter how tired you are.

At first, I was annoyed. My mind went on blaming everything — the berth, the train, the situation. I was fighting the sound instead of resting.

But then something shifted. Instead of resisting, I acknowledged it. I told myself: “It’s okay. It’s completely nor...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I had a similar experience with a fussy baby on an airplane. I had booked a first class seat on a red eye from LA to Newark and when I got to my seat I realized that I was next to a woman with a baby. Not an infant, but definitely under 2. The baby didn’t have a seat, so she was obviously meant to sit on her mother’s lap and this kid was NOT having it. Fussing, wiggling, kicking her feet, etc. 

My first thought was “you have GOT to be kidding me, I cannot believe I paid for first class only to be sat next to a fussy baby!” I am not generally a rude person so I wouldn’t have said anything or made a scene but I was fuming internally. I looked around to see if it was worth asking a flight attendant quietly if there was another seat I could move to but looking at the cabin it didn’t seem likely. 

And then I saw the woman’s face and I could tell that this was not her idea of a good time either. In that moment I realized that this was happening whether I liked it or not and the only control I had in the situation was how I responded to it. I’m a mom also, my kids are older now but I remembered how hard it was sometimes.

So I introduced myself to her, asked her friendly questions about the baby (how old, what’s her name, etc) and then told her to please let me know if I could help her with anything to make the flight easier and I made the decision that no matter what happened I would treat her with empathy and not be a jerk about it. 

And about 20 minutes into the flight the baby fell asleep against her mother’s chest and didn’t make a peep until we landed. So if I had been rude or passive aggressive it would’ve been for nothing.</div>

Because as a mom travelling with my kid I always worry about how he is going to disturb the flight, and me stressing gets him worked up. So I work on showing calmness myself, but by showing that Mom that you weren't going to act annoyed helped her calm herself and her son. 100%</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This reminds me of a time when I was younger and slept outside on a warm night, on a hilltop under a clear sky during a meteor shower.  As the night progressed I would be visited by hungry mosquitoes and I realized I wouldn’t be getting much sleep for all the swatting I let doing around my exposed head and neck.  I took a similar approach and tried to be accepting and observe the sensation of the flies landing and in some cases biting.  Like your description, it really did shift my perspective enough to calm my body and after a bit of time being the observer, was able to fall asleep.  

Also only got 2 or 3 bites that night.  And the meteor shower was amazing :)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I am a piano teacher with many students. 

For every student I keep a running and dated list of where we left off and anything special that happened for the week. Like if they got a new puppy, if there's a certain piece that they want to learn, if they were nervous about their math test, if they need to have their Theory checked...

It has been a wonderful tool for many years. 

I also keep a planner for professional teacher stuff, like recital prep, books to purchase, payments to turn in, whatever...

But that running and dated list for each student, helps me settle into the moment for each lesson. 

Such a small thing but it's quite helpful.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That’s such a beautiful system you’ve built. It goes beyond just “tracking progress” and actually shows care for each student as a person, not just as a learner. Remembering small details like a new puppy or a math test probably makes your students feel really seen, which is half the magic of teaching. It’s like your note habit is both practical and personal, removing the friction of “where do we pick up” while also strengthening connection. Honestly, that sounds like the kind of consistency that stays with your students long after the lessons.</div>

At the time I thought it was absolutely ridiculous, but I was a kid, what did I know? As an adult I think back to that part of that job and realize how important that little part of that job was. It made sure I spent a little time focused on every single one of my kids every day. None were left out, I got a deeper connection with every kid, and I learned so much. It made me a better caretaker for sure! I think I was one of the only people who took that seriously, but I’m so glad I did.</div>

I like having at least a general idea of what I'm doing when I come in during the morning over having to try and remember what the plan was. Can end up wasting time just thinking about it which can be embarrassing. Especially helpful if you have a team to manage as well.

It's actually shocking how many people above me didn't do this in previous jobs.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly! That "blank start" feeling eats up more time than people realize, and it shows up even more when you’re responsible for others. Having clarity at the start isn’t just about efficiency, it sets the tone for the whole team. And you’re right, it’s surprising how many leaders skip such a simple habit. Sometimes the smallest structure creates the biggest difference in how smoothly the day flows.</div>

The journey from; let's say Cambodia to the US can be a fulfilling experience that can show you it is worth living.

But brains are systems, not nodes (neurons). I don't have any expertise on what this news means for structural change. Does such macro change emerge from neuron transplants? Without such change, how much is the disease alleviated?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There's been many articles about the age of the platform or speculating on Nissan killing it(and already having a badass replacement ready to go lol).  This isn't that speculation or rumors though, Nissan is actually retiring the R35.  Hopefully they don't follow the trend and it's successor be a CUV with a CVT and top-trim of 290hp(actual HP, not bubble era gentleman's agreement HP).  Unfortunately, the new Z, despite being everything one would want in a Z, doesn't seem to be selling well enough to inspire confidence in Nissan being able to afford to field a GTR successor.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don’t think it’s a fair comparison. Pretty different price point.

The M3 was a $50k car, the GT-R was a $70k car when it released. 

It kept similar ratio the whole time (today the base models are $80k vs $120k)</div>

That’s just what they say. It is absolutely not what they do. 

Trump is not an aberration, he’s not a bug, he is conservatism working exactly as it’s always intended to. The only difference is the speed at which it’s moving. A lot of of the things Trump has been doing were always supposed to just be carrots dangled in front of their base. Trump is actually delivering.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">"Hey buddy, my daddy died for that flag."

"Really? I bought mine. They sell 'em at K-Mart for 3 bucks."

"He died in Korea for that flag!"

"Wow, what a coincidence. Mine was made in Korea."

No one—and I repeat, no one—has ever died for a flag. See, a flag is just a piece of cloth. They may have died for freedom, which is also the freedom...to burn the fuckin' flag.

There are some guys out there that will fuck me up if I do certain things, but they have no solid grounds to stand on for doing so anymore. Anyone should just do whatever the hell they want because fundamentally there is no law and no reason to respect the shell that formerly was the American institution of law and order.

"We obtained the following results:

Medical or surgical masks

Ten studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask in the community studies only, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness/COVID-like illness (9 studies; 276,917 people); and probably makes little or no difference in how many people have flu/COVID confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 13,919 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported; discomfort was mentioned.

N95/P2 respirators

Four studies were in healthcare workers, and one small study was in the community. Compared with wearing medical or surgical masks, wearing N95/P2 respirators probably makes little to no difference in how many people have confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people); and may make little to no difference in how many people catch a flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people), or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people). Unwanted effects were not well-reported; discomfort was mentioned."

Seems like maybe they spent enormously and are beginning to realize their spend was too much, too quickly. And now they have investors breathing down their neck.

If they are going to hype this up again, they better actually release nano banana this time.
