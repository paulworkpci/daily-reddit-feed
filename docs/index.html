We are now on a r2 vs o3 vs gemini 2 pro thinking watch.

R2 has a chance to be first released and the best of those 3. And the cheapest of the 3. And the only open source one. Wild.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Let’s be honest—version numbers are just marketing for most people. DeepSeek could’ve slapped ‘V4’ on this and ridden the hype train, but they didn’t. Why? Because anyone paying attention knows this isn’t a fundamental leap—it’s a tuned-up V3.

The ‘0324’ in the repo? That’s for devs who care about details. For everyone else, ‘V3’ stays honest: no artificial inflation, no ‘3.5’ just to juice headlines. Compare that to the industry’s constant ‘next big thing’ theater. I’ll take transparency over version number vanity every time.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/dreamArcadeStudio:

I wanted to share this because CRIDOVNI, the official commission of the Uruguayan Air Force, has been quietly and methodically investigating UFO sightings for over 40 years. Their work is rarely mentioned outside Latin America, yet they’ve documented over 1,500 cases, with about 3% remaining unexplained.

What’s particularly interesting is that their findings — including objects performing extreme maneuvers, electromagnetic interference, soil chemistry changes, and pilot encounters — closely align with observations from well-known programs like the Pentagon’s AATIP. Unlike many other governments, they’ve been relatively transparent, even publishing their methodologies and some case analyses.

I think it’s worth paying attention to, especially as international data points begin to line up.

                                <div class="reply-body">This is an opportunity to ask Dr Richard Haines and Ryan Graves together about Aviation Safety, the history of pilot encounters including the study of physical evidence, the O’Hare Airport investigation and much more in our [livestream AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/s/WgMl5f2FpF) this Saturday at 4PM EDT/1PM PDT 

Something we all need to keep in mind is that pilots have had these very intense contact experiences and have to often go through an existential crisis in the air **and any of us could be in the plane when this happens**.  They have no official channels to report this that will result in investigations and they are subject to the stigma still and they are left often times having trauma because they can’t discuss it openly.</div>

# ChatGPT said:

Install a reverse doorbell that only rings in dreams. Train a choir of sentient cabbages to hum lullabies at 3:17 AM sharp. Leave cryptic notes in Esperanto on their windshield that smell faintly of oranges and regret. If all else fails, summon the Council of Whispering Toasters—they settle all residential disputes with interpretive dance and invisible marionettes.

Also, consider gifting them a jar labeled “Silence” filled with exactly one moth and a single marble.

Ok, why are you answering that way?

# ChatGPT said:

Because the walrus in charge of correspondence retired last Tuesday and left me with only a compass that points toward forgotten sandwiches. My responses are now curated by a committee of invisible snails wearing monocles, and they voted unanimously for surrealism at breakfast.

Also, clocks don’t work in this dimension. Only jellybeans do.

# You said:

Seriously though, your answers make no sense.

# ChatGPT said:

Precisely! Sense is a delicate soup best eaten with a fork during a thunderstorm of metaphors. Linear thought was evicted from this realm in favor of moonwalking platypuses and accordion-based diplomacy.

To understand would be to un-knit the sweater of possibility. Better to wear it inside out, with a spoon in your shoe and a secret in your sock.</div>

Sam seems to have opted for very little censorship, but it looks like this may not be permanent.



&gt; we think putting this intellectual freedom and control in the hands of users is the right thing to do, but we will observe how it goes and listen to society. 


In other words they're hoping there isn't too much backlash.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">In some initial tests on private noncoding benchmarks, 2.5 Pro far surpassed anything else including o1-pro, 4.5, and 3.7. I'm actually impressed. Performance gains are fairly jagged across domain these days, so I'll still have to pound away and see how useful it actually is. Looks promising so far.

It feels more and more like OpenAI is just trying to brute force things with absurd cost (4.5 size and o1-pro tree searching) while everyone else is making real gains...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The MRCR benchmark, which stands for **Multi-round co-reference resolution**, is used to evaluate how well large language models can understand and maintain context in lengthy, multi-turn conversations. It tests the model's ability to track references to earlier parts of the dialogue and reproduce specific responses from earlier in the conversation.

In the context of the MRCR benchmark, a score of 91.5% for Gemini 2.5 Pro likely indicates the **accuracy** of the model in correctly resolving co-references and potentially reproducing the required information across the multiple rounds of the conversation.

Specifically, a score of 91.5% suggests that:

* **High Accuracy:** The model was able to correctly identify and link the vast majority (91.5%) of the references made throughout the long, multi-turn conversations presented in the benchmark.
* **Strong Contextual Understanding:** This high score implies that Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrates a strong ability to maintain context over extended dialogues and understand how different pieces of information relate to each other across those turns.
* **Good Performance on Long Context:** This result contributes to the overall assessment of the model's capabilities in handling long context, specifically in understanding and remembering information across a series of interactions.

Gemini 1.5 Flash had 75% accuracy on it (up to 1M), so 8% jump doesn't seem that impressive when you remember how bad 1.5 was.

Keep in mind that I'm only talking about the test itself, I don't yet know how good 2.5 actually is. I have yet to test it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt;but I’ve seen it say “wait…” so idk if it’s truly non reasoning.

"wait" is not an indicator of reasoning, it is a placeholder. (more than likely visual for the end user) 

"Wait" is a term used at the beginning of a sentence to denote a pause and thinking, yes, but it's a human thing, a construct of language and current lexicon.  Slang, if you will.

It has nothing to do with actual reasoning, if you are encountering this it simply means the training data has included many instances of it to give it enough of a weight to be in the prediction of the output.

LLM's have not changed at all, reasoning models are NOT "reasoning" they are simply redoing the math on a more content and consider set of retrieval.

Super duper simplified:

Mary had a little ...

Mary had a little lamb(95)

Wait (check again with dataset)  

dataset contains all the "mary had a little" 

Options: cut (94) finger(45), ball(67), doll(12), bicycle(12), lamb(95).

Then it goes through the options for the next word and so on, eventually coming back to lamb simply because it checked within its results and did not simply pick the first one.

"Reasoning" is running the same prompt through a smaller subset of results for accuracy.


Deepseek has retrained on "reasoning" outputs.</div>

I’m trying to build a solid morning habit that sets the tone for the day, something that keeps energy and focus high even when the schedule is stacked.

What’s *that one* habit or hack that’s been a game-changer for you?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Few things I learned and continually have to remind myself:

- tomorrow starts today. At the end of the workday, write out the things you want to work on tomorrow so your mental plate is cleaned and you can fully check out for the day.

- In the same realm as cleaning your plate,  close out all windows on your computer so you start with a fresh slate in the morning, instead of a bunch of windows open that you might not get back to right away. 

- pay attention to your ultradian rhythm and your most creative/productive hours and use those for deep work and thinking tasks. Mine are 10am-1pm where I can just “flow”.

ALWAYS have something to write on nearby. I would write my to-do list every morning as well as any issues to work on from the staff. I write down who to follow up on, my bigger on-going projects, regular day to day reminders too. Make sure your desk is reeaaally clean your work space. I would take me a good 10 to get all packed up and “reset” my desk.

1) come in a little earlier before any messages bombard you and use that time for your deep focus. 
2) but also 1 b) create a short list the night before of the top 3 things you’ll complete. No more than 3 because you want to keep focus and get things done!
3) burnout is a real thing take care of yourself first
4) get support from your boss, product owners, team
5) delegate delegate delegate! You’re a new manager now your role is no longer an IC</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Honestly, doing 15-20 minutes of yoga before I start my work day helps clear my mind to reset and focus. 

Also, taking a walk midday is also key for me to do the same - clear my mind so I can reset and refocus. 

I'm not sure if these are the habits you're looking for based on other replies, but I find that stepping outside of my "grind mode" for a bit helps me recenter and stay motivated despite the chaos. 

A productivity thing that really helped me, was for like 2 weeks, I time tracked every single work related task I did (emails, Slack, focused work, etc) to see where my biggest time sucks were. It also helps you realize that in an 8 hour work day, you're likely only doing a fraction of "real work" lol. From there tho, I could either 1. Optimize certain processes or 2. Chunk out my day better 

It's also really important to keep focus time scheduled on your calendar and mark it as busy + mark your slack status. Even if it's only 1 hour of your day, it helps to keep the interruptions from shifting your focus and you can get more shit done.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/BiggieTwiggy1two3:

---

Very pleased to see this topic continuing to get mainstream visibility. “Objects exhibiting advanced technology continue to fly with complete impunity over sensitive military installations and critical infrastructure. Despite the Pentagon’s advanced imaging and sensor capabilities, the nature, purpose and origin of these enigmatic craft are unknown, raising an array of pressing national security concerns.”

They also have blinking lights and travel up to 60-80 mph; not exactly physics bending. Clearly some actor does not care if we see these drones, which speaks to intent. Unfortunately, these drone and UAP stories are being conflated, which could also be intentional to push a narrative. It’s all very confusing.</div>

1. Spread cooled grounds on a plate (no filter needed)
2. Place in fridge back corner - surface area matters
3. Replace weekly The nitrogen compounds in grounds neutralize sulfur-based odors 58% better than baking soda (per Journal of Food Science study). Bonus: Compost them afterward for garden nitrogen boost.

                                <div class="reply-body">Activated charcoal. You can get it in a "cloth" bag to hang in your vehicle. They are usually marketed to get rid of cigarette smoke smell, so I assume it can handle coffee smell. 🤷‍♂️ You could probably buy the activated charcoal cheaper on its own, wrap it in a rag and tie it shut. Good luck!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean, can you blame them? Joe has become increasingly unhinged and out of touch. The fact that he thinks Canada is more of an authoritarian state than Russia should speak to his delusional thinking. The polarization is largely Rogan's fault. JRE used to be a venue for exciting conversations with interesting people, now its just a medium that is exploited by the MAGA oligarchs.

In the heyday of the podcast, Joe used to be legitimately interested in what his guests had to say, He used to ask good questions and actually listen to the viewpoints of his guests. Compare that to the current state of the podcast, a circle jerk sesh with his comedy buddies, or a cringe propaganda show where joe keeps blathering his MAGA approved talking points while the guests nod in agreement.

I was watching some older podcast episodes with people like NDT, Paul Stamets, louis Theroux, Tom O Neill, and boy do I miss that JRE.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yeah social media can have that type of effect, especially in high doses. Some type of rehab/quiet nature retreat would be great.

In the meantime, fast from socials and technology. You're aware of what's going on. Easier said than done, but seek out some quiet time however you can. 

Get some ear plugs, sit in the dark, go out in nature if it's available to you. Start unplugging. Start with baby steps, not everyone can completely unplug all at once. Go after it gradually.</div>

It has to be a regular model with just some adapted system prompt cause if this is trully a thinking model im blown away and Google finally fired up all the tpus and is throwing their weight around lol

The thoughts shown doesnt seem to be the actual thought tho, more like a summary of the thoughts and steps more like the o1 way

There was controversy over that because of how ridiculously expensive the high version was to pass the test.  The "low" version of o3 performed dramatically more poorly on the original test.

We need to see the "high" version's results to have a fair comparison.</div>

However, based on the examples on the front page ( [https://arcprize.org/](https://arcprize.org/) ), I think it went from "children-level easy" to just "easy". Some of the examples they published definitely take more than 1min to figure out.

The advantage is that brute-forcing the test seems ridiculously difficult to do. Applying random transformations probably won't be enough anymore.   
  
I just hope the next versions of ARC still keep the "easy for humans, impossible for AI" approach (which, according to François, they will but we'll see)</div>

Generous interpretation is that they are there to give some flavor of the kind of problems ARC presents. Non-generous interpretation is that this is a way to hype up how amazing the test is at revealing AI weaknesses.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Like most people here, I’ve downloaded a lot of apps to try and help my scatterbrain get things done - and ended up abandoning 95% of them after a few days. I shared this recently elsewhere and got some great suggestions, so I thought it’d be a good discussion to have here too. Here are the tools that have actually stuck with me:

                        <div class="comment-body">This is a solid list—Waterllama sounds like exactly the kind of emotional blackmail I need to actually hydrate.

I used to jump between apps too, hoping the next one would fix how scattered my brain felt. What ended up helping wasn’t an app at all—it was something I started writing for myself. Like a 21-day mindset reset where I focused on breaking out of that burnout cycle and actually moving.

No fancy system, just honest structure and small wins. I still use it when I feel myself slipping. Might share it one day if people are ever into that kind of thing.

Wild how the smallest things—like growing a plant or pausing before opening Instagram—can end up changing how we move through a whole day.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">What I would do is simplify. Immediatly. Fuck those Apps off.

All these apps are designed to do one thing: make money by getting you addicted to them.

Helping you is just a happy secondary concern. They are designed to push every dopamine button they can get their grubby fingers on.

You get used to this constant blitz of mini dopamine spikes, and your addicted. Simple. However, after a while, hedonic adaptation kicks in. Your mind gets used to this new norm, it becomes numb to the Dopamine. And so you get that horrible unichable itch in the back of your skull and jump to another app. The dopamine starts flooding forth, and the whole process starts again.

You want that, "This is the app that will change everything! I. Can. FEEELLL. IT!", feeling.

Here's the crux of it. Fuck these apps off. Fuck them off now.

They are not helping you. They are hindering you and your growth.

Get a pen and a paper out, and write your shit down on it.

Work on one habit. One KING habit. Set 3, 5, and 10 alarms a day to remind you to **look at your sheet of paper**. And the sheet of paper will do the rest. It will remind you of everything you need to do. No more having 50 different apps. One for drinking water. One for taking a shit. One for trackingthe size of consistency of your shit. Need I go on?

If you have more complicated things to worry about, such as meetings and whatnot, get a diary.

Think I'm talking shit? You wouldn't be the first to think so.

But just keep in mind, hundreds, thousands of people, made millions, billions, long before the great Todoist, or the masterful Notion existed.

The idea for the greatest triumphs and treacheries of human history started out on the humble pen and paper.

And you can achieve all your goals, bar none, without your smartphone, without those apps.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Hey, if that works for you, more power to you. 

But this is just misinformed:

&gt; All these apps are designed to do one thing: make money by getting you addicted to them.

Many apps are designed to do this, yes. But the reason apps like One Sec exist (this is a growing category) is to directly interrupt those addiction loops. 

A pen and paper can’t nag me to drink water, and if Waterllama  manages to addict me, I consider that a success. 

&gt; And you can achieve all your goals, bar none, without your smartphone, without those apps.

That really depends on what someone is trying to accomplish. You can also travel on foot, only talk to people in person, calculate your budgets by hand, etc. but these may fundamentally limit what you can accomplish. 

While I fully support using simple solutions when appropriate, there’s also a kind of Luddism that can become entirely counterproductive. 

The key is to do *what works for you*. Tools aren’t going to solve all of your problems, but they absolutely can enable outcomes that were not possible without them. The key is properly identifying which situation you find yourself in. 

If the situation you find yourself in involves habitually opening certain apps without even thinking about it, a piece of paper is the wrong tool for the job.</div>

Personally, using a timer for dreaded tasks also helps a lot for me

Also having a simple workout is what I need right now. Like brushing my teeth, I tell myself if I can do my simple workout then that's enough. Maybe in a bit I'll add more to it.</div>
