                        <div class="comment-body">Limits remain: The demo connected two buildings a kilometer apart. We still can’t amplify unknown quantum states, so long-haul scaling needs quantum repeaters/quantum memories and entanglement swapping—none of which are solved at production scale. Penn explicitly notes long-distance scaling as the main barrier.

For the ecosystem: it’s meaningful. It shows that standard IP-style networking can coexist with quantum traffic on existing fiber using a manufacturable silicon photonics chip. That lowers integration risk for telecoms and invites larger pilots (multi-node meshes, inter-operator trials). Expect more city-scale testbeds and alignment work with networking standards groups; still, true intercity networking needs quantum repeaters/memories and end-to-end entanglement swapping—none of which this result solves.

When a user requests a photoshop professional for an edit they don't get any manual control either, the professional does. They can ask for revisions but it might cost them more, but with AI now they can do more and more revisions and point out exact details to change. The main limitation is resolution, which is pretty low still.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Google has become amazing, and good on them. I’m super impressed and work with their tools often.

But they’re *part* of a workflow, just as Creative Cloud is.

At the same time, while the majority of professionals with Photoshop in their workflow will use it even more, the majority of *human* don’t have Photoshop.

Google is playing a bit of catchup to OpenAI, who at like 85% of all public AI usage, is the “Kleenex” of AI. But Google’s advantage is search and Android both of which dwarf ChatGPT’s 700MM weekly actives. And Google is continuing to show up huge on those.

Photoshop’s fine, though other parts of Firefly are now less compelling (though they smartly and quickly added nano-b to Firefly partner models), so corpos will negotiate more favorable renewal rates. But people forget about the value corporations hold in copyright protections, and Adobe has been *way* more consistently reliable as an enterprise provider than Google over the decades. Like, crazy significantly so, which is one main reason Firefly 4 is both great but limited.</div>

The capability of AI studio is amazing considering it's free. What I don't understand is how they make money out of this considering AI is eating their search and advertising revenue. Are they pulling a starbucks move trying to crowd out the competition before raising prices? seems a bold strategy considering open source AI is only 6 months behind frontier models.</div>

Some engineers at a fundamentally evil company have made some admittedly good tools you'll be allowed to use for a while until they abruptly pull the plug with no notice whilst their monopolization efforts continue.

Also Google is the only entity making the tools to facilitate doing exactly the things people are afaid of w/r/to AI.

They're trying to destabilize an ass-ton of industries to emerge as the necessary figure in the wreckage because search is sunsetting as an infinite money pile and they need the next one.

At Tesla there was a software engineer within the autopilot team that downloaded a shit ton of code. Trying to remember if he used a usb stick or he just airdropped it to himself. He then booked a one way trip Shanghai and started working for XPeng for their autonomous vehicle program.

TLDR: China is the safe zone to pull this hustle 😂</div>

Here was an extreme case involving a Google engineer (Anthony Levandowski) working on Waymo and then moving to Uber:

*In 2019, Levandowski was indicted on 33 federal charges of theft of self-driving car trade secrets. In August 2020, Levandowski pled guilty to one of the 33 charges, and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.*</div>

It's clever because it's hard to counter from the right.

Yes, it's inmature, it's stupid, it's pointless, it's mean, it helps nothing, fixes nothing, most of it is a lie and nothing about it can you be held accountable for.

That aside - it's sad that society needs this, but I also think it's going to become common, especially in technologically advanced countries. There's nothing worse than having literally no one to talk to and if the soulless robot is the only thing available? Eh. Still better than nothing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I don't think it's neccesarely sad. The world is a very complex place, and for a multitude of reasons, not every single individual can have access to someone who fulfills their emotional needs.

In an ideal world, everybody could have the emotional support of real people, and being taken care of, especially when they are getting on in years, or sick, or just lonely in general, but sometimes it's impossible. So, if AI can alleviate suffering and loneliness, IMO, it's a good thing, or at least better than the alternative of having nothing but empty entertainment to fill the void. AI interaction might be a shallow facsimile, but at least it tricks the brain into thinking you are not alone or that somebody cares about you.

We should strive for a world where human connection and care is the norm, though. This should be a bandaid, not a substitute.</div>

Is it worth *nearly $4000 every week* to have your minions all say “no issues to report” or “I need to talk to Kevin but I’ll take it offline”?  Not to mention the momentum loss of stopping an analysis, wandering to the conference room, and getting back into the groove afterwards?

I also got really good at saying that due to staffing issues I was severely overbooked but would be happy to provide written status in lieu of meeting attendance.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I worked at this company that did project work. Transferred from client-facing to an internal role.

The client facing side operated like this. Everyone knew our meetings were expensive. That didn't mean we didn't have meetings. It meant our meetings had purpose and left with next steps. Everybody that needed to be there was there or it didn't happen so decisions could be made.

When I went internal it's like the company forgot how to run a simple project. I shit you not I would have meeting with my peer in some other department. We would both have a meeting with our boss to convey that and they would have a meeting with theirs. And that got filtered back down to us. Such an insane waste of time and money.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I've always felt like the Tahoe was just the epitome of big SUVs, basically ever since the mid '90s when the big Bronco was killed. Like I know Ford can built good shit...but the styling of the Expedition has just never given me the impression that they gave a fuck, it always looks so cheesy and half-assed effort to me, whereas GM (at least since the '07 redesign) actually put some effort to making the body lines smooth and blended and panel gaps small and shapes appealing...and then with this newest gen, they just stepped up the sexy even more, where the Ex just kinda looks like a Chinese copy.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Interestingly enough, the final score tallies show that it’s basically 4 great SUVs, one pretty good SUV, and a dud.

Tahoe: 209

Wagoneer: 208

Expedition: 207

Denali: 207

Armada: 200

Sequoia: 188

The Sequoia being a hybrid doesn’t feel like it’s worth the trade off in lack of cargo/rear seat space.  The fact that it only got 1-2 MPG better in their 450 mile trip than the other SUVs basically makes it a wash.  I think Toyota would’ve been better off just sticking the regular non-hybrid twin-turbo in it instead.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The sequoia is so terribly packaged, zero surprise it came in last, was expecting that even before I started the article. I genuinely do not understand why they sell as well as they do. 2nd row is uncomfortable, 3rd relative to the competitors is unusable, trunk has the awful parcel shelf &amp; divider, its terrible at being a full size

I know this is a luxury-suvs-from-"average"-brands lineup but I feel like at the top trim armada you should really just step across to a luxe qx80 for similar money

I think its funny how much folks here hate on the wagoner when the product itself is actually quite good its just that the brand(s) around it have gone to shit. If it weren't for the steering, performance, handling metrics it would have won the comparison outright</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I honestly find it's more about the number of turns in your conversation. 

I've dropped huge 800k token documentation for new frameworks (agno) which Gemini was not trained on.

And it is spot on with it. It doesn't seem to be RAG to me.

But LLM sessions are kind of like old yeller. After a while they start to get a little too rabid and you have to take them out back and put them down. 

But the bright side is you just press that "new" button and you get a bright happy puppy again.</div>

The smarter models can remain coherent for longer, but they all eventually develop some weird repetitive phrases or styles that they always come back to and refuse to stop. If you keep chatting, they'll fall deeper down the rabbit hole until the chat is garbage.

For coding, I've found that new chats are almost always better than continuing anything 5 or 6 prompts deep. It's a little different for GPT-5 Pro where it feels like it's solid so long as the prompt is good.</div>

I've read books well over 1M tokens, I think (*It*, for example), and at the time I had a very clear idea of the world, characters, and everything related, at any point in the story. I didn't remember what happened word by word, and a second read helped with some little foreshadowing details, but I don't get confused like any AI does.

Edit: checking, 'It' is given around 440.000 words, so probably exactly around 1M tokens. Maybe a bit more.</div>

Only on the Plus plan, not doing crazy usage, but have yet to hit any limits. Will see how it goes for the rest of the week, but damn so far so good.


UPDATE - Wow, the CLI limits are shit. Hit my WEEKLY limit in well under 10 hours total running only 1 agent at a time. Still able to use Codex web though, so ...</div>

So $375 for Chat + $100 or for Claude.

I'm up to $475/mo. I'll grant you I'm working multiple clients at once. Throw in a discount for days off and slow days.. $300/mo.

College is not just vocational training, it teaches you how to think critically, examine your sources, do research, solve problems, all of which you will want and need. It’s also fun and a chance to meet lifelong friends from places you’ve never been, broaden your perspectives, challenge your biases, cultivate personal discipline and independence

Who are you working for post-singularity? Why do they need you to work exactly? At what are you beating a super-intelligent species? Do you want a dog to do your taxes? How come dogs get free lunches? I can understand a fear of AI not needing us and getting rid of us, but the idea you would be working for gods is hilarious.

Consider taking a year in college but maintain your flexibility. Keep your schooling cost low and learn to network. Don’t fixate on the quality of the schools. All accredited courses stick to similar standards. Ultimately, it’s the student’s responsibility to learn, not the school’s to teach. So, don’t stress about committing to a degree. Spot opportunities when they arise. College is an excellent place to discover such opportunities. Stay flexible because no one knows what will happen.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Honestly, I think questioning experts hypothetically sounds like a decent idea. Experts most definitely have been wrong in the past. But in practice, it's just not realistic that the general public would "do their own research" on things like MRNA vaccines and form their own opinions. \
Typically when people say they are "doing their own research", that just means they are selectively looking up "experts" that fit whatever political/social views they hold. Then they are parroting to the best of their ability whatever is stated on the supposed expert's website.</div>

They’re telling you the sky is green and you’re a totalitarian if you think it’s blue.

This is coming from the Secretary of Health and Human Services who recently said and I quote verbatim: “people shouldn’t take medical advice from me”

The RFK thing is the most bizarre part of MAGA because I can’t even see what the grift is, it just seems like an unhinged conspiracy theorist has been made the head of a major government department because he bent the knee for Trump.</div>

RFK thing is not complicated at all. Whatever he’s spewing just listen to what he eventually recommends as a solution. He’s just selling that thing or has a stake in it %90 of the time.
