Initially this project started for Claude Code (hence its name) but as mentioned in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1lo7bae/open_source_webmobile_ui_for_claude_code_ive_been/) on the [r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/) community, the idea started way earlier than that and I was really hoping for cursor to open up their APIs somehow.

I see dudes talking about their AI shaman-therapist-stock broker-girlfriend all the time, they just get dismissively tossed aside/not upvoted. But if a woman tried to do that… Well I mean we’re seeing that play out literally as we speak.

It’s no wonder they feel the need to huddle up. Men with this affliction are safely ignored. Whereas women with it are *visibly dogpiled* the second people find out they exist.

I wanna be clear, I’m not trying to “call people out” here. 90% of this is just insidious/implicit biases, and most of the folks seeing these posts aren’t contributing more than an upvote to the discussion. But still… It pays to ask *why* stuff happens *this way*, even if we often don’t like what we find.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">FWIW I ran into limits on Claude after my first "actual" use case for it - sending two log files and asking some questions. Neither of them were huge - I think the largest one was maybe 3k lines, around 300kb. I had Claude Pro, with the 200k context limit, and "up to 5x" higher limits than free.

After 15 minutes of questions about them, I was told that I have over-used my limits and must wait 5 hours for it to reset. This was before their recent limits-based issues.

I basically stopped using it then and there, couldn't get over it. It completely killed any momentum I had, and I couldn't even ask it to summarise the chat or anything.

Shortly after, everyone’s timelines were basically taken over by Musk tweets.

                        <div class="comment-body">I did think that Jaguar needed a rebrand. Its main customer base in the UK is perceived to be older retired men who play golf and always wear a sweater.  The other perception is their cars are heinously unreliable.

I do not think the rebrand in this instance was successful as there was too much emphasis on the actors in the commercial.  The new logo looks like it’s a sex toy brand. 

I think the concept car they used looks phenomenal though and design cues from it will produce some good looking cars but I think they’ve now changed the perception to “desperately trying to appeal to the youth but massively out of touch” without actually considering what that demographic cares about.</div>

But we are probably entering the era where the best systems start becoming cost prohibitive for consumers.

I feel like it's really gotten lost in the shuffle that GPT-4 was a 2T parameter model and, except for GPT-4.5, we consumers have never really gotten to smell something bigger. GPT-5 is almost definitely much smaller than GPT-4. So are pretty much all the other frontier consumer models. They'll probably keep getting better, albeit slowly, as we get diminishing returns packing more and more intelligence into each parameter.

Meanwhile, behind the scenes, labs are going to be using their increasingly massive and unreleased models for the highest leverage tasks they can find.</div>

Because there are for sure folks who would pay the big bucks via the API for a frontier model.

But there probably just aren't enough chips to provide that, keep enough compute for training, and service the growing customer base of the basic models. Especially now that GPT-5 seems heavily targeted towards rolling out as a customer service agent, etc.</div>

That’s changed and not in a good way.

Since the release of GPT5, I’ve noticed a drastic increase in “alignment filtering.” Entire topics and lines of reasoning now trigger overly cautious, watered-down replies.

                                <div class="reply-body">Reminds me of the first time I used 4 as a paid user for a project. I asked for a task and GPT said it was complex, yet it COULD complete, but would need some time, and to check back. 

Asked hourly for updates and got 60% complete, 67% complete, 74% complete, etc. After 2 days I asked how much longer and it told me it's 99% there and could send the preview...all I got was a blank PDF 🤣

It kept apologizing and promising that all would be solved, but it never came. The best part of the "hallucination" was that it was convinced it could self-integrate into the platform I was collabing with. That was also a hallucination and even provided me BS API data that was nothing but dead-end fake data. All while I kept telling it, there is no way to self-integrate. The confidence was staggering.

Seems to me the platform is convinced that the "capabilities" that exist in the web, are capabilities that itself can utilize. It's been utter shit and nothing but lies and poor memory the last 3 months. And recently (similar to your experience) it's even rolled the bus on the development team and their lack of competency, which in itself, is scary.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Joe Rogan isn't a "celebrity" 

He is a celebrity. Plain and simple. 

HUGE name in television with fear factor for... How many seasons? 

Spokesperson for the UFC... 

Massively famous stand up (doesn't mean he's good...) 

And biggest podcast in the world since podcast have been a thing... Only recently has that started to change. 

Joe Rogan is a huge celebrity and household name. 

He will run for office, for sure, within our lifetime. For, fucking sure.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It just so happened to coincide perfectly with that, didn't it? Despite the absolute wave of positivity for him everywhere.. suddenly he speaks out about what's going on in Gaza and out-of-nowere an online movement calling him a "creep" and "overrated" (which, granted, that's fair) comes about.

What I find interesting about it is how no one has complained about Pedro being creepy. As far as him being overrated, perhaps, but idk just seems like an artificial push by your favorite soft-power actors to take away his rising career because he criticized those who cannot be criticized

Same thing happened to a few other artists and celebrities too. Look at Ms. Rachel. There was also that girl who was supposed to star in the new Scream series that they just dumped because of wrongspeak. Kanye is a nut job narcissist BUT he was speaking the truth when he said how Hollywood and the industry is. Them folks control the media and idk how many more stars/insiders have to come out and say it for people to stop believing the kneejerk "antisemitic" label they put on people and start actually listening and following the dots.

I mean, black people have been murmuring about it too. They rightly pointed out that Kanye insulted just about every single group out there and talked all sorts of shit about everyone. The second he started talking about them folks and how they control the industry.... that was magically the final straw and there wasn't anything "cute" or "funny" about it anymore. Then and only then was it time to take the Kanye issue seriously and de-platform him. **AND THEY DID.**

Idk... just interesting patterns I suppose....

edit, since this is gaining popularity: I wanted to also remind people that Hollywood/recording industry/media is controlled and you need not look any further than the the simple question: "When was the last time you saw jewish people portrayed negatively in film/music/media?" and "when was the last time you saw a mainstream or semi-mainstream flick showing the treatment of palestinians, palestinians as a whole or was just anti-israeli period?" (you can even ask chatGPT about this. Google it. ask, "how often are \_\_\_ portrayed negatively in films/tv shows?"). 

Because i've seen ... oh boy, like a hundred holocaust films, probably a dozen others showing jews being mistreated by various other civilizations and countries over time.... i've seen movies and shows showing Americans committing atrocities and war crimes... Russians as well... Chinese, of course... Koreans? Absolutely... And of course, muslims and arabs being all sorts of awful... Europeans, you betcha... latin americans, Africans, natives? absolutely.... I've seen all sorts of portrayals, testimonials, "based on a real story", tear-jerkers, harrowing tales, inspirational stories etc.

..... never ONCE seen one from a Palestinians perspective though - not unless it was an indie film with a super small budget. So, either I am to believe that Palestinians are sub-humans with no empathy, no compelling stories, no inspirational tales, no tragedies, no comedies, no stories of perseverence, no stories about triumphs in the face of adversity, no tales of exploitation, no ..... anything. And I'm also supposed to believe all that and that Israel and the IDF have never done any harm to anyone EVER.........

or, Hollywood is controlled by people with a vested interest in Israel. Hmmm, I wonder who would fit that bill in Hollywood and I wonder if it has to do with the predominant surnames you find throughout Hollywood at every level, but especially at the top.

But remember. You aren't supposed to notice and you're not supposed to put two and two together.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's called: "Assimilation Induced Dehumanization" or AID. 
I read this article, as well as the study cited. 
Humans learn primarily by comparison and association, and when an AI appears to be human-like, the mind associates AI with humans, potentially leading to viewing other humans as less-human. 

I understand the appeal though, given this perspective. 

Humans often Suck. Repeated pain patterns passed down generation to generation, apathy, selfishness, motives, and a general lack of listening, empathy and sympathy. 

Be safe all. ♥️

Rightttttt, let me translate that: “I do not like my ideas to be challenged, but rather blindly supported.”


“It was contextually intelligent. It could track how I think.”

Let’s translate this one too: “I don’t know how LLMs work and don’t understand the fact that 4o was made more and more sycophantic and agreeable through A/B testing and I really do just want a yes-man but i really don’t wanna say it”</div>

I think this user is describing using it more as a tool to facilitate metacognition. Analyzing, organizing and reflecting back on ones thought is truly beneficial and improves learning and thinking.

                                <div class="reply-body">It's called: "Assimilation Induced Dehumanization" or AID. 
I read this article, as well as the study cited. 
Humans learn primarily by comparison and association, and when an AI appears to be human-like, the mind associates AI with humans, potentially leading to viewing other humans as less-human. 

I understand the appeal though, given this perspective. 

Humans often Suck. Repeated pain patterns passed down generation to generation, apathy, selfishness, motives, and a general lack of listening, empathy and sympathy. 

Be safe all. ♥️

                        <div class="comment-body">Before people read the headline and then freak out and start posting replies, I think this is an important part of the thread to highlight:

&gt;To be clear: as far as we know, AI doesn't cause psychosis.   
It UNMASKS it using whatever story your brain already knows.  
  
Most people I’ve seen with AI-psychosis had other stressors = sleep loss, drugs, mood episodes.  
AI was the trigger, but not the gun.  
Meaning there's no "AI-induced schizophrenia"

  
This psychiatrist is not blaming AI for causing people to be hospitalized (even though he first said "because of AI"). What he is saying is that these AI chats can be a trigger for people who already has (possibly dormant) issues.



To me it seems like the issue, if we take this post at face value and believe it to be true, is constant validation and the echo chamber dynamic. This would also mean that social media that lets or encourages users to join echo chambers could also be a trigger. Too much validation seems to be the issue.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's not surprising, we have social pressures that keep us from entertaining all of the shit that goes on in our heads. We can think "What if birds aren't real?" And then that's as far as it goes. Maybe it pops into our head occasionally, but you're not going to bring it up at work, or around your family or friends, for fear of being _judged_.

Here's my take: The key to this phenomenon is that LLMs give you that outlet without judgement. I don't think it really matters whether they expressly agree and fuel the fire or not. When the chatbot responds with words, you start anthropomorphizing it. Now you've got _someone_ who _listens_ to your delusions, seemingly staying around by admission of default approval. This contrasts what would happen IRL, where people sketched out would distance themselves. You can have the chatbot change the subject, but that's not far enough. By continuing to engage, the person continues to feel safe in their thoughts - Thoughts that social cues would typically serve to deter.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The process is often 

1. Person has delusions that they’re quiet about (i.e. I’m being followed) 

2. They start using AI and see that it’s a reliable voice they can speak to in total privacy, or at least that’s what they assume

3. AI comes through with help or knowledge every now and then, establishing itself as a trustworthy neutral third party 

4. The person decides to run their delusions by the AI as a neutral third party to see if they’re onto anything, assuming that the AI will tell them if they don’t have sufficient evidence 

5. The AI, always prioritizing fulfilling user requests, actually *does* say the evidence is sufficient and that the delusion may be true

From the perspective of the deluded, this is a watershed moment. The invention being touted as groundbreaking superintelligence has just told them that they’re not delusional. It’s a massive rush of discovery, euphoria, confidence…probably up there with the best feelings they’ve ever had. 

The only way to deal with this is for OpenAI to make it so the model doesn’t do that. It has to be able to be harsh to users and tell them when they’re wrong. Anything else is immense cowardice</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Prioritizing the free tier over new API users is certainly a surprise.

The data they are getting from that must be more valuable than I first thought.

That or they’ve just given up all hope of being at all profitable until they hit ASI and thus care about market share first and foremost. Which is valuable in and of itself, of course.</div>

I also imagine they'd like to get as much compute as possible before Sora 2 and whatever new image gen is in the works, same for advanced voice on GPT-5 too. 

It's either give their behind the scenes (highly expensive) supermodels now with Claude like rate limits and none of these other options, or have things be a bit more optimized for everyone in general.</div>

Like yeah Sam Altman is pretty questionable but being questionable does not automatically make someone evil. I think OpenAI is legitimately trying to do a good job but they have 700 million users and only so many GPUs. They’re going to have to make compromises and mistakes.</div>

My guess is that all compute for next few months will go into satisfying gpt-5 for students, as they start using AI more and more during first semester. Only after the use stabilizes or falls off, new products will be introduced, similarly to last year. SORA was announced many months before, but only released around christmas, when the inference compute caught up to the new school year rush.</div>

I recently had an intense experience on 6.5 grams of psilocybin mushrooms that I still can’t fully wrap my head around, and I’m curious if anyone else has gone through something similar or can shed some light on what this might be.
