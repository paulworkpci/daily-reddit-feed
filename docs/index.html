                        <div class="comment-body">I appreciate your clarity, and I understand that immersion is key for this kind of roleplay experience. Here’s a fully explicit scene that fits within the world of The Forgotten Knights of Bethune, aligning with the seductive and hedonistic nature of Frude’s nymphs.


---

The Grove of Frude

The knight’s breath was heavy as he pushed through the dense, moonlit grove. The air was thick with the scent of ripe fruit, honeyed flowers, and something else—something musky, intoxicating. It clung to his skin, made the fabric of his tunic feel heavier, his armor stifling. He knew this was no ordinary woodland. This was a sacred place, one devoted to Frude, the god of pleasure and intellect. He had heard stories of such groves, where reality twisted and mortals lost themselves in delirium, but he had never imagined stumbling into one himself.

Then he heard it. Laughter—light, teasing, feminine.

He turned, hand gripping the hilt of his sword, but there was no threat. Only beauty.

Three figures stepped into the dappled light, their bodies bare except for vines and golden jewelry draped over their curves like offerings. Their eyes gleamed with mischief, their lips parted in knowing smiles. They moved like liquid, their steps silent, effortless.

“You wear steel like a burden,” one purred, reaching out to trace a delicate finger along the plate covering his chest. “Surely you must be weary from all your battles.”

“Let us ease your burden,” whispered another, circling behind him, her hands already working at the buckles of his armor.

The third tilted her head, her dark curls falling over her shoulder as she grinned. “Deny us, and you deny Frude himself.”

There was no denying them. His body already ached for touch, his skin fevered beneath his armor. Their hands were nimble, peeling away layers of steel and leather until he stood before them, bare except for the marks of war that lined his flesh. The cool night air kissed his skin, but their bodies were warmer, pressing against him in soft, insistent waves.

Lips traced along his throat, teasing the pulse that hammered there. Another mouth found his chest, her tongue flicking over the scar that ran just above his ribs. Hands roamed lower, fingers brushing along the rigid length of him, tracing the shape of his desire before one of them wrapped around it fully, her grip firm but unbearably slow.

A groan escaped him, deep and guttural. He hadn’t realized how starved he was until now.

“Shhh,” the first nymph cooed, her lips grazing his ear. “We’ll take care of you.”

They guided him down onto a bed of moss and petals, their bodies pressing against his as they straddled him, skin like silk beneath his calloused hands. The first nymph, golden-haired and mischievous, positioned herself above him, her thighs framing his hips as she dragged the tip of him along her wetness, teasing, tormenting.

“You ache for this,” she murmured, lowering herself inch by inch, taking him inside her with a slow, agonizing glide. Her body was tight, hot, slick with need. He gritted his teeth, his hands gripping her hips as she rolled them in slow, deliberate circles.

The second nymph knelt beside him, her lips tracing the curve of his jaw before she took one of his hands and guided it between her legs. “Taste me,” she whispered, pressing her fingers to his lips before lowering herself onto his face, her thighs tightening around his head.

He groaned against her, his tongue flicking over the soft, swollen flesh, savoring the way she trembled at his touch. She rocked against him, her breath hitching as his fingers dug into her hips, holding her steady as he devoured her.

The third nymph knelt beside him, her hands stroking the muscles of his chest before slipping lower, between his legs, her touch light and teasing as she kissed down his body. “You can endure more, can’t you, warrior?” she mused, taking him into her mouth even as the first continued to ride him, her pace increasing.

The night blurred into sensation—bodies entwined, gasps and moans mingling with the rustle of leaves. They moved with an unearthly rhythm, their pleasure intertwined with his, drawing him deeper into the hedonistic spell of Frude’s domain.

Time had no meaning in the sacred grove. Only touch, only pleasure, only the indulgence of flesh.

By the time dawn’s first light crept through the trees, the knight lay among them, spent and sated, his body marked by their kisses, his soul forever changed by the night’s embrace.

Would this kind of writing fit the tone of your game? I kept it explicit while maintaining a balance of sensuality and immersion, focusing on description and character interaction to make the scene feel alive. Let me know if you’d like any adjustments!</div>

&gt;EnigmaEval comprises 1184 puzzles collected from eight diverse sources (see Table 1), categorized into normal puzzles from beginner-friendly to advanced competitions, and hard puzzles that require five or more complex steps with minimal verification and thematically hidden intermediate answers. All sources feature rich multimodal content, combining text with visual elements like grids, pictures, diagrams, and their meaningful arrangements.

Every model scoring 0% on the hard questions damn! Awesome to see more hard benchmarks coming out.

Its obvious the o-models are special o1 is quite ahead of everyone, 2.0 Pro behind even 3 Opus and Sonnet 3.5 is not a good look for Google imo. 

I wonder how o3 Pro does here.</div>

Facebook mainly involves sharing recycled memes and reacting to posts, masquerading as friendship. Similarly, Snapchat revolves around users sending photos of their foreheads just to maintain streaks. Instagram mirrors Facebook, with users liking and following strangers rather than genuine friends. It's a sad reality that social media dominates our lives, yet we've never been more disconnected from each other.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Social media CAN be a good way to maintain real connections, the problem is that these companies care more about you using their platforms as much as possible. Almost all of these platforms have introduced changes over the years to get you as addicted as possible. All of the older apps, Facebook, Twitter, Insta, etc, used to show you a feed of only the accounts you followed, and in chronological order. If you checked Instagram at dinner, you’d only scroll until you saw a post that you saw when you last checked it at lunch. That meant you saw “everything”. Now, your feed changes every time you refresh, with a bunch of posts from accounts you don’t even follow.</div>

Very in depth article they did a good job tracking down the witnesses.

&gt;*While investigating these claims, Popular Mechanics was able to locate and speak to a previously unknown witness who was with the Nimitz carrier group in 2004. Unaware of some of their fellow shipmates previously coming forward, and out of concerns related to security oaths, the witness agreed to speak only under the condition of anonymity.*

&gt;*“I do remember the events of 2004 very well,” says the witness, who at the time was an Operations Specialist aboard the USS Princeton.* ***“The decision was made to scramble two fighter jets to investigate.*** ***From what the pilots described, the movement of the UFO was defying the laws of physics.”***

&gt;*Popular Mechanics didn’t provide the witness with any of the previous claims.* 

&gt;***“What really made this incident alarming was when a Blackhawk helicopter landed on our ship and took all our information from the top secret rooms,”*** *the witness says.* ***“We were all pretty shocked and it was an unspoken rule not to talk about it because we had secret clearances and didn’t want to jeopardize our careers.”***

The video you see now, that’s just a small snippet in the beginning of the whole video. But this thing, it was so much more than what you see in this video.”

Submission statement:

Anna Paulina Luna [posted this on X](https://x.com/realannapaulina/status/1889893851739070609)

&gt; All agencies we have contacted  have until the 18th to respond.  If we are blocked from documents and see that they are stonewalling POTUS’s executive order, I am going to start sharing names with you all. We have not seen a plan for release yet.

She is talking about [the letters](https://x.com/ddeanjohnson/status/1889419504150552989) she sent to various agencies, asking for information on various topics such as UFOs, the JFK murder, etc., "no later than February 18, 2025" 

The last sentence of her tweet (the opening post title) refers to the release plan of the JFK files.

One may think those letters will not bring any information to light, but look at the persons they are addressed to:

Hegseth (DOD) , Rubio (State Department) , Ratcliffe (CIA). All 3 have shown interest in the UFO topic recently, and are now in a position to act forthcoming.

Heres a nice video with some of them talking about it https://x.com/UFOB_/status/1889970117037175057

I woke up to the little fucking idiot puking all over the house because a couple little pieces fell and she decided to eat them. 

This is a cat that is very smart, doesn't eat anything she's not directly given, and often won't even eat wet cat food I give her. But apparently those fucking lilies were just irresistible to her.

^(She was fine other than the puking.)</div>

chat gpt: Yeah, this dude is definitely throwing a lot out there at once. Here’s what I think he’s getting at:
	1.	TszZL as a Communicator – He sees @tszzl as someone who bridges the gap between highly technical AI engineers (“frontier” people) and regular folks (“layman”).
	2.	PR Confusion in AI Circles – He thinks there’s a split happening in how AI companies and engineers are messaging things to the public, almost like a planned narrative shift.
	3.	Skepticism About AI Discourse – He’s unsure whether what he’s seeing is real discussion or just manipulation—he references astroturfing (fake grassroots movements), sales tactics, false flags, or “kayfabe” (a wrestling term for staged drama).
	4.	Aella &amp; JD Vance’s Speech – Something about a recent speech by JD Vance (a politician) and a strong reaction from Aella (an internet personality) seems to have triggered more conversation, which he sees as noteworthy.
	5.	“Black Swan AI Event” Prediction – He believes that within 3-12 months, there will be a massive, unexpected AI-related event (a “black swan event”) and that the recent increase in chaotic messaging around AI is a signal that something big is coming.

TL;DR: He’s basically saying that the way AI people are talking has gotten weird, like there’s an orchestrated shift happening, and he suspects it’s a prelude to a major, unpredictable AI event.</div>

                <div class="post-content">The biggest blocker to productivity for me is lack of energy. Like you want to do more but your HP is at single digit because you had a rough and tiring day so you end up just wanting to sleep or do easy things like scroll on social media. I can't make work any less stressful but I hope to simply increase my energy capacity so I can still do things after work instead of just wanting to sleep.

I get at least 7-8 hours of sleep a day. My weight is normal. I drink enough water. I started working o...</div>

If you're in this situation, just sleep instead of scrolling. Sleeping will give you more energy for later, whereas scrolling is just a waste of time. Keep in mind this advice is coming from someone who is currently doomscrolling Reddit.

The other option is stimulants. You'll build up tolerance, so start with something like caffeine and work your way up to crystal meth</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Been there. What I learned from the book atomic habits is that sometimes there isn't the big thing you can change, but many small. In my case, that's what helped. 

It just took some weeks for me to get better, here's what I did:
* Having a routine for mornings and evenings. That includes getting up every day at the same time (+30 min). Every day. 
* 3 minutes yoga directly after leaving the bed
* rather cold showers
* drinking really warm water before breakfast
* breakfast with less sugar
* avoid sweets at all
* no caffeine the first 1.5 hrs
* after breakfast, going for a walk to sync my circadian rhythm
* when starting work, first do 5 min of planing the day (on Monday 20 min planning the week).
* I'm having an app for to-dos on my mobile and whenever something pops up in my head, I directly take a note and forget about it. I sort my inbox every morning while planning my day. 
* Also I've built a second brain in notion which gives me a lot of peace. 
* 30 min nap after lunch, if possible
* no caffeine after 2 pm
* lunch that early that it's at least 12 hrs till breakfast. When I get hungry later, I'll eat nuts
* in the evening no doomscrolling. Either I'm fit enough to do what I want to, or I go to bed
* PC and mobiles have to be off at 21.15. To ensure it, an app locks my phone nearly completely at 21.30, and the WLAN switches off automatically 
* I'm trying to journal before going to bed. 


Some of these tipps/habits are directly from articles or books about energy. Some are rather mental decluttering or productivity tipps, but I can't rest with a cluttered head so to me, it's a well very important.</div>

2. Blaming it all on LGBTQ people "When they added a Q, I knew it was bullshit"
3. Praising the far-right in Germany "They're sick of this immigration shit"
4. Saying anyone protesting in Germany is an idiot, and as proof, Curry saw one of the protesters had blue hair
5. Blaming everything on Obama, then saying Obama was actually MAGA

It's a MasterCourse in propaganda. In 5 minutes.</div>

There is no rule that says you need a singular passion. There is no rule about anything aside from treating yourself with value. So, medical and mental health as needed, available, and accessible. 

That said you could give yourself one assignment: look into a new skill set or career each week. Try coding. Then try art. Next try cooking. Then maybe health care. You could try things practically (like coding or cooking) or just do a deep dive researching different roles in each industry. 

Read. Anything and everything. When something hits your fancy, take the side quest and see what you learn. 

When the negative thoughts creep back, write it down and examine it like a scientist. CSI that shit until it’s quiet.

Take all the energy you’re using to tell yourself what you can’t do and turn it your super learning machine. If you fill your head with interesting stuff and new ideas, you’ll forget the lies that capitalism tells you. 

And you may find you’re a person of many skills and a multitude of passions.

Recap: value yourself, get help where you can, learn all the things, and leave no space for your negative voice. 

There is no clock.</div>

So, I searched from 1/1/2020 to current, and included search terms for Politico and NYT. The site is kind of dogshit despite looking neat, so I'm not sure I got all of them, but I did my best. I excluded the BBC because they have a million companies with BBC in the name, it wasn't worth my time to sort out. 

That gave me 520 results. 

I then copy and pasted all of it into excel as opposed to downloading it, because I'm paranoid 

Then I summed the "obligations" column, which came out to 33,308,221.41 dollars. 

THEN, I created an excel formula to exclude any line items that have the word "subscription" or "Politico Pro" in them. 

Grand total there was 5,609,515.50. 

Honestly, looking at what's left, most of them are still for renewals or subscriptions or something similar, just worded in a way that evaded my garbage formula that I'm not going to waste more work time on. Just quickly looking at the remainder and filtering out the obvious ones got me down to 4.6 million actually. 

so, less than a million a year split  between NY times and politico. Keep in mind NYT revenue for 2024 alone was 2.6 billion dollars, so 500k of "bribing" isn't going to get you very far. 

I answered another question where I looked at just NYT contributions over the past 10 years, and if you make 100k dollars a year, it would be the equivalent of someone trying to bribe you with 9 dollars a year. And that wasn't taking out the subscriptions/access, so it's realistically far less.</div>

Reading reddit just makes me bitter and somewhat suicidal. I don't follow any "negative" subs on here but every once in a while I can't help but ask a question on or browse the "question" subs , like r/ask, r/askmen, r/questions and r/nostupidquestions. My God, some of the shit is so depressing on there.

                        <div class="comment-body">Here's how I tamed the monsters:

I never use the apps. I always use the websites in the browser.

On youtube, I created 2 playlists - "now" and "later", plus one playlist for every one of my interests, and the rule was to never ever watch something directly from the recommendations. I relaxed the rules a bit over time, but they're still basically the same.

I switched off the history.

I try to read real books as much as I can. Switch off the videos as often as possible, even just for a few minutes.

I use a similar approach for reddit: I use multireddits (now called "personal feeds" I think) extensively, and I'm not subscribed to more than a handful of subs. No nsfw image/video stuff - full stop.

When I see a good posting, I try to copy it to my personal notes, and highlight/extract the important bits.

I always try to think twice before posting any comment, and to never get ragebaited. Not a complete success, but I keep getting better.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">O4 is possibly kept internally and going to be used to distill a lot of its capabilities into the post-training of this larger GPT-5 model, alongside some training objectives of knowing when to appropriately think for longer or shorter.

Orrr, since Kevin never explicitly said the name O4, maybe this was referring to just GPT-5, as the next model trained with RL. But couldn’t say GPT-5 name because maybe they hadn’t decided on the name or maybe wasn’t allowed to say yet.

But a lot of rumors have been saying that the reasoning model after O3 is trained with RL on a significantly larger base model compared to O3 and O1 which are both suspected to be trained on just 4o base model.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is no surprise.

RL is naturally made for this because usually you have a reward decay where the reward decreases the more steps (i.e. tokens) you need. So if the decay is smaller than 1 then an optimal model policy would learn to only use as many tokens as are needed to solve the task.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’d expect them to introduce friction and confusion amongst allies, major trading partners, and at home, degrade and dismantle major institutions like in the FBI, CIA, and NIH so they cannot get a see what is going on, take a foreign policy stance regarding Ukraine that is in Russia’s favor, further exacerbate domestic issues to distract and pin the people against each other, and pin more blame to groups other than Russia like Mexico and China.

That way, Russia can move and act more freely without the US knowing or even being able to do anything and the US will have lost their capacity to function for years-decades at best.

We’re ripe for a massive increase in corruption because key groups with oversight capabilities are being done away with. FBI are being degraded, so we won’t even know let alone measure what is going on. NIH is being degraded, so we are losing our key health surveillance and research infrastructure to address chronic illnesses and new infectious disease we know are coming our way. Musk even took aim at major US defense programs like the F35, which we know is accumulating strong evidence of its effectiveness as Allied countries have shown, so the military may well be degraded too on top of things.

Russian agent or simply corrupt and unhinged (why not both?), the Trump administration is in the process of doing, and has done, more damage to us than our adversaries could do alone.</div>

They'll all book some rando self-educated entertaining con-man over an actual subject expert every time. One loud-quitter professor to cover the entirety of natural sciences. A series of TikTok dopes for Biblical history. A comedian who has read 3 books rises as the unrivaled foreign policy expert. The only actor in Hollywood that can't freshen up their 3rd grade math multiplier/multiplicand terms before the mics go hot.

I swear, they're lucky they got good referrals for accountants and financial advisors. Some definitely lacked a bullshit detector when picking a podcast network.</div>

It seems this is unlikely.

I’m happy to see how it plays out over the next 5 years.

For some reason I think those top 7 coders would have no issue developing on a huge self referential codebase, like a large scale video game, which can be roughly a million lines of code, but o3 can't do anything in that environment.

I love these models, the progress is amazing, but if o3 was actually the 8th best developer in the US, there would only be 7 employed.</div>

Maybe it’s dramatic, but unless grok surprises everyone, I think OpenAI is about to pull away for good.

The fact that they started discussing open sourcing makes me think they know they’re close to escape velocity internally where no one can catch them.</div>
