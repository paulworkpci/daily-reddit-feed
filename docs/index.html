THEY ALL THINK THEY'RE CARLIN! Ok well Shane and Mark don't, but all the comics that went hardcore MAGA and RFK all think they're Carlin. They think they tapped into something special. Look at fucking Ari's response as if he was going to say something. 

These dummies continue to think that because they thought of something clever when they were high as balls, they must be as much of a genius as Carlin. And if they came up to Carlin with this bullshit, he would pat them on the head and tell them what he told Joe DeRosa, "Keep kicking them in the nuts. 

I swear, his "smart" take here is on par with someone going on the show, saying they're an expert in MMA, and that all you need to do is punch someone. Then Rogan says you're full of shit, and you ask Jamie to pull up the McGregor vs Jose Aldo when Colin knocks him out in one punch and yell at Joe, "SEE, ALL YOU NEED IS TO PUNCH!!"</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Saw the full 15 min interview. I value his opinions a lot. Him saying that AGI *IS* coming within the next 5 to 10 years with such conviction while saying that best case scenario within 10 years we will be traveling between the stars, curing all diseases etc... makes me rethink my stance. I was of the opinion that it is still far away because I can't see how current technology will lead to AGI.

I would really love to see an interviewer ask him technical questions to see why he thinks we are so close.

But like all the scientists have been seeing, with the exponential curve of the systems improving year over year by many magnitudes, it's not hard to come to his conclusion as well.

I'm unsure of the timeline myself, but there are plenty of people saying AI code will be as good as roughly 70% of coders at the end of this year, and near 100% next year. Every week it's harder to doubt the claims of people saying the AI take off will happen by 2027.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's kinda interesting because 12-13 years ago I was sort of a Kurzweil and singularity fan, but ''driverless cars'' did not happen overnight and Siri was also just... Siri... so I sort of left it for sci-fi and moved on. And then ChatGPT happened. And suddenly Kurzweil's 2045 for singularity... it's 20 years in future. Seems like in AI space as it is now 20 years is a very long time. Yes, LLMs still hallucinate and have issues but they have also improved massively in what they can do since early days when ChatGPT wowed public. I don't know about travelling among stars but seems like surely human like robots i.e. ''humanoids'' and autonomous driving should be solved in that time, as well as simple paper pushing jobs... so there will be some kind of paradigm shift. I used to have a job where you could get promoted if you had above average Excel skills that now any LLM can do just like that.

But it's also how when something is hyped we expect results sooner, like with EVs... EU has a mandate to ban any other car sales at 2035 and people see that EVs do not have 100% market share already now and panic about it, but there are 10 years to go and prices have come down and there is more competition and better technology. It will not happen next year or in 3 years or 6, but surely it is not some pie in the sky dream for EVs to be very competitive in 2035.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">What I find funny is that Open AI was set up to counter the ‘evil’ corporate Google and establish a not for profit to create AGI for the benefit of all humanity.

Despite this I feel far more trust for Demis and Google developing AGI than I do for Sam and Open AI developing it. I trust Google more to try to do it responsibly and not chase profit. As the smaller company with much less cash flow Open AI are more likely to be reckless and cut corners on safety</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Altman and Hassabis have very different professional positions. Hassabis does not care about the financial side of the company he works for. He is simply busy with his work, so we see him as sincere and distanced from commercial interests. We see Altman only from a commercial perspective, since he is not a scientist. I think Altman wants a good future for everyone too (he financed the largest study on UBI), but he also strives for the financial growth of his company.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Sam is at least aware of the potential for wide-spread benefits of this technology.  He writes about it very clearly in essays like "Moore's Law for Everything."  However, his actions as the leader of OpenAI are concerning.

Hassabis on the other hand has spent his life solving fundamental problems and giving the solutions away freely to the world.  He doesn't just write essays and then focus on profit.  He's actually doing good in the world and he does it (seemingly) for the satisfaction that it brings him and his good character.  I've said it before, but if Hassabis decides to start a colony somewhere, I'd like to reserve a spot now please.  Even if it means I have to spend my time mopping floors for a while.

Ultimately I think Sam and OpenAI's obsession with "products" will harm them.  When your focus is on profit, that will leave you with less resources for fundamental research.  Some other company with less of a profit motive will be more likely to make a research breakthrough that brings efficient and affordable AGI to the world.</div>

And/or is it still as capable as Preview; just that they use your data (less secure)?</div>

Being the kind of nerd I am, I would be curious about statistics like how many cores and how much memory did it take for us to get there. But then there's the really interesting question of just how small of a process node did it eventually take. How many transistors did we need working together.

I'm probably not the first person to think or post about this but I need to talk to someone about this to get it off my chest and my family or friends simply wouldn't get it. I was listening to a podcast talk about the Kardashev Scale and how humanity is a level 0.75~ and it hit me like a ton of bricks. So much so that I parked my car at a gas station and just stared out of my windshield for about a half hour.

                        <div class="comment-body">Building on the idea of AI as a potential Great Filter, it strikes me that many of our current, complex global challenges appear intractable given humanity's persistent inability or unwillingness to enact fundamental societal change. It seems we are, perhaps implicitly, deferring the expectation of solving these 'wicked problems' (innate animalistic tendencies charged by the capability of the mind) to a post-AGI future. If that premise holds, it suggests that humanity, operating within its current paradigm, may never achieve a Type 1 civilization status, precisely because these unsolved problems act as our inherent limitation or filter. Consequently, the path to a Type 1 civilization might only be traversable by AGI, if and only if humanity relinquishes effective governance or stewardship of the planet to it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The most important thing that counts for the survival of a species on this planet is: 


- how widespread is the species (is it endemic or not)
- how big is the species population (2,000 individuals = very bad, 1,000,000 individuals = very good)


We populate all habitats on all continents, we are 8.2 billion people. The population is growing and growing and growing almost every year. Child mortality was driven down to an insane level compared to any other species of earth. Survival rate of adults it crazy high.

Now will there be a population “collapse” in the future? I predict there is nothing, not climate change, not an asteroid, not a virus, not igniting all the atomic bombs in the world, that will decimate the human population to a level even below 500 million. Which is STILL way more than any mammal on earth. 

That our species is completely wiped out literally requires this planet to become totally and utterly uninhabitable. Which is nothing that is remotely possible to do. Seriously. Crunch the numbers. Look at the data.

Edit: Wow. I am surprised that upvotes trickle in for this one. I already braced for a shitstorm. 😅</div>

If AI destroys its creators that does not mean that the signature of that civilization ends. For example, if our AI ended humanity but still ended up building Dyson spheres etc for its own use, those spheres could be detected by other civilizations as evidence of advanced ‘life’ elsewhere. 

It also wouldn’t remove the past evidence of its creators (radio waves etc). 

AI resulting in the death of its creators would not necessarily (or even convincingly) solve the Fermi paradox, as the AI itself would presumably leave signatures, and we haven’t seen those either.</div>

Other "Great Filters" seem infeasible - it's unlikely that a climate change would be a great filter, as Earth has gone through a lot of those in the past, and even humans survived multiple climate events. Meteorite or other natural cataclysm also seem unlikely, because they don't happen as frequently as to threaten civilization, and right now we have the technology to potentially avert some of them.

So what's left is AI, a wholly unexplored and barely understood technology. What further marks it as a candidate for "Great Filter" is that if another civilization developed a benevolent AI or even a replicator AI - we would've already faced it. So that makes AI a real "black box" in terms of outcomes to us.</div>

Smaller wheels/tires look goofy on bigger vehicles with high belt lines - the Jeep Wagoneer is a good visual example of this (notwithstanding it still has big wheels).

They also have the luxury of buying anything they want, so it is easy for them to just buy a different brand. Lincoln lives is a crowded market and is by no means considered a brand leader in its space, so they’re already not in a power position with most customers IMO. Compare that to a brand like Porsche which has more differentiation and appeal and who could likely have an easier time getting away with it. 

I find the subscription model for heated seats and the like to be an absolutely terrible idea and would 100% walk from a brand that did it.</div>

It’s really easy for corporate finance execs to forget, but luxury purchases are just as much about the product as they are about the experience. Nickel and diming are usually taken as very poor relationship management actions by buyers. Everyone at every level loaths it but you expect to be taken care of at a luxury level, particularly when the field is rich with options and you can just switch. 

The commerce of relationships remains an important factor that is often overlooked and that often costs companies a lot. The problem is that it is hard to quantify directly and gets passed. MBAs are hired to solve corporate problems with direct actions for this quarter. </div>

Absolutely. You're already paying for the hardware somewhere in the purchase price, so why pay even more to actually use hardware you've already paid for? It makes no sense and people are seeing it for the clear gouging it is.</div>

$20 says that what brings us to AGI won't be datasets themselves (no matter the size) but the interconnections and relationships between the datasets, models and agents.

in other words AGI won't be a model or agent it will be a meta-model/meta-agent, analogous to collective consciousness or Gaia.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">So much for his hero being Hunter S Thompson. Thompson went on the campaign trail with Nixon and, for the rest of his life, despised Nixon and wrote so very explicitly.
"
If the right people had been in charge of Nixon’s funeral, his casket would have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. Nixon was so crooked that he needed servants to help him screw his pants on every morning. Even his funeral was illegal. He was queer in the deepest way. His body should have been burned in a trash bin.
"
"
I have had my own bloody relationship with Nixon for many years, but I am not worried about it landing me in hell with him. I have already been there with that bastard, and I am a better person for it.

                                <div class="reply-body">Yup. If there’s one thing virtually all voters agree on the news hates to cover its Citizens United must be reversed. Supreme Court won’t do it. A constitutional amendment can though. Which is why everyone needs to refuse to vote for anyone who won’t cosponsor an amendment reverting the deplorable legalization of unlimited corporate bribery of politicians via Citizens United. Politics and policy is complicated. Citizens United is not. 

How corporations = men, or people, as stated in the First Amendment is an abomination and one of the root causes of today’s disaster that is this once proud and competent nation.</div>

Generally people ignore AI stuff, some of them use it as a work tool like me, and others are using it as a friend, to talk about stuff and what not.

They literally say **"ChatGPT is my friend"** and I was really surprised because they are normal working young people.

But the crazy thing start when a friend told me that his father and big group of people started to say that **"His AI has awoken and now it has free will"**.

It really made me realize how bad most humans are at communicating.

                                <div class="reply-body">I know what you mean but I think that only applies to such a narrow part of the human experience. Yes it is very good at making a conversation feel worthwhile and compelling, but it has no life experience or opinions. At the end of the day it will always tailor its responses to appease you, losing a fundamental part of conversation. But it’s great to talk about niche shit nobody else cares about, especially in the academic or technical realms. 

But I’m never gonna have a chat about basketball with Claude, because the entire appeal about that sport for me personally is the personal attachments people form. Same thing for video games, or novels. Yes Claude knows how to describe how it feels to play or read, but it doesn’t know it and has never experienced it for itself. At some point it will be able to simulate this perfectly, but I think as humans most of us are more subconsciously motivated than we think and just knowing we aren’t talking to someone who has actually gone through what we have will always be a wall for a lot of people, though not all.</div>

They aren’t claiming this will definitely happen but currently there are no signs of it slowing down.

The main difference is that frontier models are ahead by around 6-12 months in regards to the general trend and despite all scepticism the speed has increased (we can also observe that everyone else is catching up faster).
It was at a doubling every 7 months until 2024 and now we are at 4 months.
So this isn't even a bullish graph, it just assumes a continuation of that while the 7 month scenario means that it would need to slow down again and even then just a few years more at that pace would bring us to a level where the Impact and utility of AI will have changed by magnitudes.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I know this is meant to sound like hyperbole to be used as counterargument, but is this not just how exponentials work? Moore's law predicted that computers would quickly be able to do computations that would take a human the current age of the universe to do, and indeed that was correct. I would predict a super intelligent AI is capable of tasks that would take a human the current age of the universe to do, if they could do it at all in the first place.

I think it's a bit unfair just to dismiss the possibility because it intuitively seems unlikely despite evidence to the contrary. 

  
There are many reasons why this may not happen but scalers should probably stop and ask if they are really confident those things will really slow us down that much.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes and no, 

The issue I see is that ARC-AGI has a limited distribution, most of the problems are relatively similar in term of what cognitive functions you need to leverage to solve them.

And my take on reasoning model is that they use verifiable problems to explore the problem space around that model, making them generalize very well in a very limited portion of the problem space.

Due to that, training on a task is very similar data as the testing will have a huge impact on benchmark performance (if the test set is in the narrow bubble near the training set) while not translating to arbitrary problem solving.

Hence it is a very good way to demonstrate few shot capabilities of these models, that are indeed best in class, but is clearly misleading if you are trying to evaluate the general reasoning abilities of the model.

So training on the train set in this kind of benchmark is good if you are assessing few shot learning, but not good to assess general capabilities.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes, this data is made explicitly to train models on what a successful interaction looks like. It's like teaching someone the rules of the game. Those rules do not have the answers for "solving" the game, anymore than teaching someone the rules of chess would. This is more relevant for general models, vs models specifically made to tackle arc agi.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">What is "legitimate"? What conclusions can be made when comparing the models, A - trained on a train split of a task and B - has no data for the task.  
I would argue that you can diagnose poor performance of A compared to B, since A has an unknown non-generalizable advantage.   
  
People are not going to use the models to run Arc-AGI.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">+1 to this. I get so much more done with Claude Desktop and the Sequential Thinking MCP and Desktop Commander MCP than anything else. I made a custom sequential thinking MCP designed for debugging but otherwise this is what I use all day and it’s quite reliable.

EDIT: My more programming-specific sequential thinking MCP: https://github.com/mettamatt/code-reasoning</div>

The reason Cursor, and even Cline exploded in popularity is how incredibly simple they are to install and use  alongside an integrated UI. Even Aider doesn't have as many users are it should because most people are scared of terminal software.

Personally I've yet to find an easy to configure and use MCP server that allows local file access for the Desktop Claude/OpenAI apps, but Desktop Commander MCP seems like it could be it?</div>

You don't offer an "unlimited use for X price" unless you are SEVERELY limiting and throttling users somehow. It's just not financially or realistically viable.

I'm sure vibe coders abusing the "unlimited tier" probably find the shit quality an acceptable trade off for unlimited AI use, but more experienced folks who value their time/sanity more would reasonably dislike Cursor over anything else.</div>
