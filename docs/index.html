Of course they did not do formal complexity analysis, but that was also far more efficient than O(n\^2) when the data was approximately evenly distributed.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The earliest description of the Bubble sort algorithm was in a 1956 paper by mathematician and actuary Edward Harry Friend,[4] Sorting on electronic computer systems,[5] published in the third issue of the third volume of the Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), as a "Sorting exchange algorithm". Friend described the fundamentals of the algorithm, and, although initially his paper went unnoticed, some years later, it was rediscovered by many computer scientists, including Kenneth E. Iverson who coined its current name.

Like isn’t odd the Super Bowl is going to be there.  Terrorist (isis) don’t even know wtf Super Bowl is, you gotta dumb to believe that and the fact that they made the terrorist look like a military vet bc they want us to have an enemy within our own people.  - JUST A CONSPIRACY …..but yeah 2025 going to be interesting script!

UPDATE: If you go on google, search up 2002 Super Bowl tell me what location it was at. Then think about the events that occurred the year before…… it’s kinda repeating itself.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">They would both immediately get banished to the other side of the island.  Although both inept with basic human skills...they might have been able to survive for a week or two with cooperation. 

But no.  One of them dies within the first day during a fumbled attempt to hostily take over/rejoin the main group, killing the other to show allegiance to in-group....however, just their disloyalty is observed and they are banished to the other side of the island again where they are seen circling the outskirts of the main camp for a few days like smeagol before starving to death 4 days later, in a beached alcove, dehydrated from drinking salt water, licking moss off rocks as the waves slowly splash them more and more as the tide rises.

Imagine whoever you want makes it to the end there, this was a choose your own adventure.</div>

This is also useful for simply calming or centering yourself. I use this technique many times throughout my days in addition to falling asleep, also while practicing mindful meditation. Breath control is wildly helpful for so many reasons.</div>

The trick is not to try this once and be done with it if it doesn‘t work, but to do this (or any breathing exercise) regularly every night (maybe even as part of a bedtime ritual) and condition yourself to become sleepy from that!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Definitely do it more than once but also don’t hesitate to try another approach. You can’t condition yourself into something that simply doesn’t work for you. 

I did boxed breathing for *years* based advice like yours before recognizing it really wasn’t working for me. I always assumed it was working because I didn’t understand what true nervous system regulation felt like. I dropped it immediately once I realized this and opted instead to simply breathe naturally as possible while focusing on lengthening my out-breath. That is actually much more effective for me. 

Bottom line: this stuff is highly individualistic. **Just because it has worked for you doesn’t mean it will work for everyone.** The good news is, knowing that makes life simpler because it turns out what I just wrote there (in bold) is one of those rare things that’s always true in all situations.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree with this. Trying to build something with OpenAI Realtime API and Gemini 2.0 Flash and I'm seeing:

1. The cost isn't feasible for mass adoption. It can work as a premium service but people aren't going to pay a premium price for it.  (Look at people complaining about Claude/ChatGPT etc not being worth it when you have AI Studio or OpenWebUI).
2. Most frameworks / tools aren't ready. I've been working with Langgraph and a few other tools and they are still not ready to support these new capabilities (real time chat + vision models).
3. Reliability (not until we have these Multi-Model AI systems hooked up to "thinking" models will agent really make sense. The speech/video inputs as modalities will help the UX (no-one really wants to type), while thinking will make these agents work close to 100% of the time (hopefully).
4. Probably Inference capacity (Sonnet :( ... )
5. New business models need to solve the problem of monetization.

  
While listening to Deepmind's podcast about Project Astra their research lead talked about two-way communication, advance voice capabilities (ability for the model to understand different voices, and make out the user even in crowded and noisy environments are real roadblocks to creating products that work in the real world and promote adoption.</div>

Nobody even has a vision for a product that most people will pay more than pocket change for. 

Sure it's cool, but end of the day it's got to be better than gamepass to be that widespread.

Call me superstitious (only a little stitious) but I don't think we should taunt Murphy's Law like that.

Until you do a thing you never know what the bottlenecks might be. There's likely to be _some_ lag though.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Very impressive to see their approach and rigorous testing. No one can say they are just doing cheap knock offs if western tech. The fact that that large facility exists means they are doing development as well as assembly and supply line innovation. 

But it still looks many iterations away from a commerical product for the home or office because speed, cost and human interaction is nowhere near requirements yet. The boss guy said as much himself. That part was the most impressive. This was straight faced business talk, not the hype we are used to elsewhere. 

Does anyone expect that the first affordable commercial home robots won't be from China at this stage? I cant see anyone else producing them at the right price.</div>

Well, Tesla is pretty good at production scaling, and pretty much everything in Optimus is their own development (AI processor, actuators/motors, batteries, software, and whatnot). That's why they are the western company with the highest chance, at least in my eyes.</div>

Look at the genesis physics model on GitHub. It's done. Now it's just a matter of integration and spinning up that Stargate data centre.


This is where people are going to first notice the so called exponential.


One day, around '28-'30 they'll be n update.


And ALL these platforms, all these useless robots... will suddenly be walking around like wall-e or C-3PO / R2-D2.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The costs have been dropping enough to make it financially affordable for quite some use cases recently (just look at Unitree, but there are also many many many emerging companies from China that enter the market and lower price range in 2025) The speed of Figure has gone from 8% of human speed to around 25% of human speed in one year for use cases in production plants (doesn't need to reach 100% anyway since you can synchronize). Human interaction is still something crucial but as companies like World Labs and Google have shown significant breakthroughs are currently made there as well. Once they can utilize this for improved training these robots will see a huge, huge leap in performance. What we then still need is either enough processing power on-device or proper 5G/6G for mass interaction, but even without that there will just be a lot of applications because companies will find workarounds in a race for customers (basically having a turbo or mini model on-device.. oh and by the way, China is also leading in 6G development..anyway). This all is quite close. Things like brushes and motors are already advanced in China and elsewhere as well.

I think we'll see mass adoption of these robots in 2026-2028 eventually, not in 2025. But we'll see a lot of interesting announcements on all of this this year for sure.</div>

Teleoperating is already outdated, and can be used to jump start more efficient and creative learning methods.

I don't know if this video has been posted here before, I don't see it around, I don't think it's that popular.


"On September 24, 2016, a spherical object was filmed by the South Wales police helicopter in the United Kingdom while officers were flying at 1,000 feet (approximately 305 meters) above the Bristol Channel. The police, confused, stated that the mysterious craft was flying against the wind and was not detected by air traffic control at around 9:30 PM. The object – which could not be seen with the naked eye – was captured by thermal cameras."

We assumed it was a chinese lantern at first as it seemed to just be floating. Until it suddenly zig-zagged across what must have been 50-70 miles, left to right, before shooting off in the opposite direction almost instantaneously. Both me and my dad think about this quite a lot.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I live in south wales, I can’t remember what year it was but I remember when I was a kid, me, my mum and step dad were leaving my nans after visiting her in pontnewynydd when we literally all saw a bright orange fireball floating literally about 100ft off the floor. We stopped the car and got out but this was just as touchscreen phones were first coming out and no one really had the best of cameras and we wasn’t exactly wealthy at the time. The thing floated there for about 30 seconds before literally just going straight up and disappearing within a second. It was crazy but thanks to that I’ve been a believer pretty much my whole life. Wasn’t just us who saw it either. This thing in the video looks similar but I’ll never forget how bright it was</div>

At first, I thought, *“This isn’t enough to make a difference.”* But over time, those little wins started stacking up. Each one gave me the confidence to take on the next. Before I knew it, I was hitting milestones I never thought possible.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed right now, start small...</div>

I m almost wondering if this was a suicidal stunt meant to get attention but not actually with the goal of killing other people, or just something else all together. With his background if he wanted to go off and just kill people he could have done it. I also just don’t see him choosing a car bomb tactic. He could have geared up and just walked in dropping people if he wanted to. Check on all your people and their mental health.</div>

They'll might say things like: AI's code doesn't reach 100% success rate expectation (whether for code correctness, speed, etc).

I rely on AI coding heavily and my expectations sky high, but I get good results and I'd like to share how / why:

First, let me say that I think asking a human to use an LLM to do a difficult task, is like asking...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A lot of the dismissiveness I see among programmers is because using AI really does slow you down a lot when you first try to integrate it into your work, but that's true of any tool.

If you endure the initial pain, you quickly get a sense of what it can help you with and what it can't, and then it becomes very useful.  Eventually, you start to optimize your workflow around it - you change the way you break down problems to maximise the number of subtasks that can be reliably offloaded to a model.  That ends up being &gt;75% of the code.

It also tends to be better than me at those subtasks and teaches me new things, and I'm very far from a beginner.  One of the problems with being experienced is that you tend to solve common problems the same way you did a decade ago, and don't really notice the language or library added a better way since then.

There are countless times where I asked a model to solve a problem and I have a pretty clear idea of what I expect the solution to look like (ie, how I'd solve it), and it generates something much better.</div>

At that point you don't need to know what it's doing , just tell it what to do.
Add multimodality to that and I think a solo dev will be able to do a small companies worth of work alone and not know a line of code.</div>

Yeah you can get the LLMs to write unit tests from descriptions but they actually go the other way more reliably, for now the tests I've done all had manual target unit tests and the only real metric I've been considering is time.

But yeah 100% moving forward as you scale this up and balance more kinds of resources having the LLM's take over the meta task is gotta be the next obvious priority.

I am posting a strange encounter that I for the life of me cannot recall where I found it. I am unsure of where and what date this video was taken. I have had the footage for a while, and it is very possible that it was posted even here in the sub and I nabbed it when I could. Hoping to hear some insight into what the actual heck could be happening here. I am open to conventional means as always but I have never seen what is occuring in this video before. The light that occurs is so brilliantly bright, it's just not something you see often. Apologies as there is no sound to the video as well. Enjoy!

                                <div class="reply-body">Almost everything in *Her* revolves around artificial replacements or "jumping through hoops" (not necessarily just AI) in terms of our relationships—with one another and with nature.

To name a few examples (though there are others):

* Insanely disconnected phone sex as a replacement for intimacy.  
* He writes "hand-made" love letters for others to use, filling in and replacing a need for personal expression.  
* Even when he goes out on a date, his date expects him to instantly commit, bypassing the natural progression of the dating period. She wants a genuine connection without putting in the effort—an artificial connection, in essence.  
* There’s a scene where they discuss the flavors of smoothies instead of actually eating the fruits they’re made of (replacing food with artificial flavoring). Seconds later, they enter an elevator surrounded by artificial representations of trees.  
* AI companions replacing human companions—and eventually, AIs outgrowing and replacing us altogether.

The more you think about it, the clearer it becomes: almost everything in the movie is about replacing parts of our lives, whether through disconnection, dissociation, or invention.

In a way, *Her* explores one of our most profound fears: losing the ability to feel when we *need* to, of being past our prime. It touches on the fear of being unrealized potential, or worse, having our best moments fade into distant memories. It’s the terror of not knowing whether we’re chasing a high to rediscover life—or to burn out trying. The fear of being lost in the pursuit of feeling (only to feel too late) or realizing that feeling has become impossible altogether.

If you enjoy wallowing in your misery, this is the perfect movie to watch after emerging from a very intense relationship. Theodore is consumed by the end of his past relationship, hanging by a thread. It’s this thread that Samantha seizes, weaving it brilliantly and lovingly into a new life for — and with — him.

The best line from the movie (to me):  
*"Sometimes I think I have felt everything I'm ever gonna feel. And from here on out, I'm not gonna feel anything new. Just lesser versions of what I've already felt."*

It’s definitely my favorite movie.</div>

&amp;nbsp;  
&gt; this may sound fatalism but I believe in it more and more: it feels the whole human race has been preparing for this AGI moment. 1. We invented languages and printing to record our intelligence. 2. We invented computers, internet, cameras, mobile phones to make it easier to record our intelligence and in digital form, so billions of human are generating data with intelligence. 3. We started working on AI algorithms on large scale since Turing's 1950 paper, and then extremely fast developments in deep learning for the past 15 years, which result in transformers and alphazero. 4. We built the compute to run software, serve internet users at scale, play games and mine crypto.  AGI is not a science fiction but a certainty and our job is to make it happen as fast as possible and safely.  
&amp;nbsp;  
we built internet, kernels, software and the whole virtual world as environment for virtual AI to learn</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If I am not mistaken with polyurethane soles this is due to not wearing the shoes causing moisture to build up within the soles, causing hydrolysis to break down the material.

Normally walking on them essentially pushes the water out, or at least helps remove it. Without frequent use, the water is allowed to freely react with the soles, causing them to disintegrate upon first use after storage or soon thereafter.

Rubber will not see this hydrolysis, but will essentially do the opposite, becoming dry and brittle with disuse. 

If your shoes completely dissolved, I would bet they were polyurethane soles kicking the bucket after undergoing hydrolysis for a long time. 

The water had simply removed too many pieces of the polyurethane, the rather delicate urea to urethane linkages are typically the first to go, with the slightly more resilient ester groups that form the backbone of the molecule shortly following. Once this happens the molecule tends to lose function. Typically when a lot of water is expected through normal use, polyether polyurethanes will instead be used, as they eliminate the ester groups in favor of far more resilient ether linkages, meaning only the urea to urethane linkages will see damage through hydrolysis.

Temperature and pH can also greatly affect the rate in which this occurs, with higher temperatures and lower pH leading to increased rates of hydrolysis within polyurethanes due to catalyzing the reaction in question.</div>

Especially with sneakers and hiking boots because companies often change them after a year or two.  
I regularly buy two or more pairs of my go-to active shoes, even if they are not on sale.

                                <div class="reply-body">I wonder if it’s an effect of the army military more than this specific base. Sure, Bragg is home to top tier units and is close enough to DC and Langley for some crazy stuff to be going on there. I just don’t know.

I do know my youngest brother joined when he was 20 and not long after basic, he became an entirely different person. I have countless stories but he developed a drinking habit while at Fort Drum. After he left the Army, he became distant and cold. He was down right evil to my dad, sending mean text regularly about how he was growing up(parents divorced, Dad developed a heroin addiction and wasn’t around much). He called my mom saying he was possessed the night of my sisters HS graduation, screaming and cussing.

The day before my birthday, he took his own life with a gun in my mother’s house. This was after him finally getting his shit together. He worked in the film industry making good money. He decided he wanted to do something different and got his CDL a week before he did it. 

It’s just odd, that’s my point. The high suicide rare amongst veterans is already strange.</div>
