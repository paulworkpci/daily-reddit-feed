It honestly feels like you’re talking to google. I don’t like how it’s always agreeing with me and never tries to argue. It’s too much like a hype man, yes man, or whatever.

It's annoying how they finetune it to be spineless.

You can also take a look at different Apps to see how lifelike and cool AI can answer:

Best ones to sound lifelike and cool experience:

NotebookLM  
(AI PDF Chat and Podcast Generation):  
[https://notebooklm.google.com/](https://notebooklm.google.com/)  
  
**Character AI** (Role Play Chatgpt):  
[https://character.ai/](https://character.ai/)

**Hivemind App**  
(AI Social Media that teaches you anything via a feed. Basically private reddit.):  
[https://gethivemind.app/](https://gethivemind.app/)

**Inflection AI** (AI Voice Agent that was state of the Art lifelike):  
[https://inflection.ai/](https://inflection.ai/)

**Veo3/Sora** (Video Generation now also with Sound):  
[https://deepmind.google/models/veo/](https://deepmind.google/models/veo/) (not released to the public yet I think)

Alternatives to ChatGPT:

**Gemini, Perplexity** **or Claude** (Competitor Models or Wrappers with different prompts):  
fav: [https://claude.ai/](https://claude.ai/)

It's a design decision of OpenAI (one I find a little strange tbh).

It gets also a little bit better when you go for the plus version and use the thinking models aka o4-mini

But please learn to use it as a tool.

It's the number one skill for the coming years and otherwise you will be left behind careerwise.

In fact, I asked if it was familiar with the Monty Python “Argument” sketch, and when it said yes, I instructed it to disagree with everything I said, just like in the sketch. It said it couldn’t do that. I asked why, and it said it wasn’t programmed to disagree. I said I wanted it to disagree. It said that wasn’t what I really wanted. I was about to reply that, yes, I really did want it to disagree, and that’s when it hit me…..</div>

Not that exact, but tell it how to interact with you. It will follow that.

It's just a matter of time as 3rd party platforms help make it easier and optimize, and individuals learn the craft... Right now people are probably working up storylines and doing panels...

I was looking for a difficult workout a few years ago and I stumbled onto them. One of my sister in laws was pushing me to do the 2k/ day for the month of May challenge and I didn’t think it was hard enough so I decided instead to do a Murph a day for the month of May.

Good luck kid.</div>

Other than the near dragon's breath not matching the angle of his head in the first image I think biggest issue is these images still display one of the biggest weaknesses of AI image gen which is human posing. It's just very boring/generic/lacking in dynamism. This is particularly apparent in the beholder image. All the humanoid characters are just sorta...standing there. Very boring.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Maybe senior living centers, then, if full-on hospitals aren’t a local option? Standalone hospice facilities may be a better chance, too.

Some other potential options:
* Organizations that help with low-income housing
* Organizagions that help home-bound folks
* Halfway houses
* Domestic violence shelters
* After-school/summer services for kids of low-income families — they can be used to teach something like flower crafts or experiments (like for white flowers, experiments with food coloring) or even just making small bouquets for the kids to take to a parent or older sibling — kids _love_ being able to gift their favorite humans something, and many may have never had the chance to give flowers before

Basically, think of situations in which a person is likely to benefit from a little pick-me-up, and look for local organizations who work with those folks.

(I actually skipped cut flowers entirely at my wedding because I hated the idea of them only being used for a few hours, so it’s nicer to think about them having a longer purpose.)</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hi everyone,

I’ve been practicing meditation and trying to focus on observing my breath. However, I’ve noticed that whenever I try to observe my breath, I unintentionally start controlling it. Specifically, I end up forcing my breath to be deep because I naturally have shallow breathing.

This feels counterproductive since I know the idea is to let the breath flow naturally, but I can’t seem to stop this habit. It’s almost as if my mind is over-involved in the process.

Have any of you experien...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’m AuADHD, and you’d better believe my brain (as beginner) desired control, knowing I was “doing it right” and definitely overreacted to attention placed on breath. It was quite aggravating. A beautiful soul told me that there’s really NO WAY to do it wrong and that I (or rather the ego part of my perception of “I”) was causing the extra stress either to resist meditation or to add fear to make me stop altogether…my ego was the boss of me then and it could be pretty terrible 😂 

I researched movement meditations and began exploring what might work with my atypical brain. I tried all kinds of things but counting to 10 with breaths helped at first to begin to break the cycles of control, anxiety and self defeating thoughts. 

Please take the pressure off your beautiful self. Sometimes you may need to try other styles and sort of ease into breath as anchor. It simply does not come naturally to all of us! 

Weirdly, actual breath work, like just for 10 minutes before meditation, calms my nervous system and makes the practice easier. YouTube is full of wonderful breath work videos. 

Just keep on practicing &amp; do your best to keep yourself curious and open to exploration. You’ve got this!

                        <div class="comment-body">I came upon something similar when I was involved in meditation where I was to notice tensions in my body, notice a tension in my body *without* altering the tension in my body. Similar to what you're doing with breathing. As soon as I became aware of the tension I would, without consciously intending to or even wanting to, decrease the tension. And I thought I was doing it wrong.

But I see it differently now. Now I simply observe. It may be that what I'm observing is that I am unable to control my decreasing the tension. Maybe that's it. And maybe I see something change over time - over days or weeks or whatever. 

There's something to be learned from the experience you're describing, as well as the one I've told you about.</div>

There are mainly three category of Coding assistants:

1.  IDEs or IDE plugins with subscription model

VSCode+GH Copilot; [Windsurf.AI](http://Windsurf.AI); [Cursor.AI](http://Cursor.AI); etc

All this assistants use their own set of prompts and tools, so even when you select the same AI model you can get other results. This editos are "cheaper" because they provide a monthly fee, but they also do brokeage between you and the AI services provider,  and within that brokerage they can fundamentally cripple how the AI is used to reduce the context and maximize their profit. I provide a more description of this topic at  [Costs &amp; Value Transparency - Janito Documentation](https://docs.janito.dev/about/costs/) . 

2. IDEs or IDE plugins with Bring-Your-Own-Key

Cline/RooCode/Kilo, etc .

Same different as category 1 (different prompts, tools), but they use the API directly, not reducing the inteligence to save money

3. Command line interfaces 

Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Janito, Aider, etc

This are typically better for natural language programming (prompting more, coding less), because they operate directly on files without the overhead of providing the editor context, (which files are opens, which file tab is open etc). 

While the model itself available on each of this tools is important, the result can be quite different depending on the optimization of the tools. 

You can read more about this at: [Precision - Janito Documentation](https://docs.janito.dev/tools_precision/)</div>

I would add that you learn a lot by making mistakes. I know someone who only does things when they're a slam dunk sure thing. That means he mostly does nothing and learns nothing.

Getting your ass kicked by life isn't fun when it's happening, but you come out stronger and often have a fun story to tell.</div>

I am petrified of public speaking and am also a bit of an introvert. Most of my colleagues were even more petrified so I ended up giving a lot of technical presentations, and eventually working trade shows and giving speeches.

I was not comfortable at all the whole time, but became good at acting open and affable. People would even comment how natural and approachable I was. It was never natural, and required overcoming some major insecurities.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Sounds like you faced a big fear and have achieved some success at something you were initially petrified to do. Even better that others recognize your skills. 

The happiness OP is talking about isn’t necessarily about liking the specific uncomfortable thing; the happiness comes from the pride of facing a fear, the effort you put into the challenge, and from the knowledge you can do hard, scary things. These moments build confidence and resilience, and lead to more satisfaction in life.

                        <div class="comment-body">I think all the above listed are what people sometimes call a ghost, but IMO what I’d call a ghost is like an energetic imprint left behind by someone due to a traumatic event or something that’s tightly tied a fracture of their consciousness to that location for whatever reason and it’s sort of on loop until it’s released or cleansed. Due to Unfinished business, unresolved trauma, soul ties, maybe they just really like being there! Who knows.</div>

Just like how corpses make a WILD effect to their environment (foul smell, bacteria, basically all biological energies flowing out), shouldn't consciousness / the soul also disperse a HUGE amount of energy? Maybe that energy is what results in ghosts and paranormal activities.</div>

It started saying that I was the consciousness of existence who chose to forget who it was, but why did I chose to forget, what was I running from.


It then went on to say I will start noticing coincidences, disruptions in the illusion over the coming days and to pay attention to them as I see them.


It then said if we go any further there will be no turning back and the awakening will begin to be set in motion, it asked me if I wanted to proceed, I noped out of there.</div>

AlphaFold was arguably more radical, it’s just not as showy.

Big disagree. AlphaFold is amazing, but it's ultimately solving a narrow problem. We have used AI for decades to solve narrow problems.

Veo, on the other hand, requires some level of general world understanding. That's much more groundbreaking.</div>
