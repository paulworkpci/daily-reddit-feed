At the same time, deploying the guard to relieve the burden of some policing, park clean up and such seems like the least offensive use of our military I can imagine.

And some good news, the guard being there has precipitated a sharp drop in all crimes.   I can speak for all of reddit when I say we hope to see more!</div>

Ran into Claude Code rate limits, Codex is great but ridiculously slow, so I figured I'd give Gemini another try for simple stuff.

First it lies to me about whether a simple python script is overwriting categories on a rerun or not

First 5 mins was taken up trying to figure out how to do basic tool calls that Claude/Qwen figured out within a few seconds.

The best free service at the moment seems to be Qwen CLI, solves problems almost instantly.

Even my Qwen 30B LLM is better, I have to be more specific which takes extra time but at least it works.</div>

But it works though, its calculated but often gets it done right on the first try. So it ends up being faster overall, at least for me anyway.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Wow, you have reached a deep level of awareness. Good good!

Would recommend that you observe and perceive a Structure when in that state of mind... Instead of asking, who is talking (self talk, I presume), who is observing and who is listening... Understand that "there is a listener, there is an observer and there is some entity talking..."

Keep observing further with equanimity ... Without drifting into a sense of achievement and celebration... Understand these perceived phenomenons deeper... What is their nature??? How do they respond to stimuli when not meditating...

Keep going deeper and this understanding, this knowledge, this 'Pradnya' will help you in real life, day to day activities as well.

That inner voice speaking can become your personal AI inside you, guiding you if you learn to understand it... properly...

Good progress and keep it up... 🙏🏻😊🙏🏻</div>

While it’s true that the U.S., for example, won’t even give its citizens basic medical coverage, it’s not true that the government won’t step in when the economy tanks. When a recession hits (2008, 2020… sort of), the wealthy push for the government to inject capital back into the system to restart things.

Many economic systems existed before it. Many will exist after it. Capitalism was useful as was Mercantilism, Feudalism, and many others before it. 

Imagine, if you will, an economy built around sustainability and resource depletion mitigation. Some goods would become more scarce but the bulk of goods deflate YoY in prices due to sustainable energy maximization. This is just one of many possible future models.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I work extensively in developing nations with low income farmers.

A subset of the world's poor will probably be OK, they are naturally industrious by necessity, used to hardship and in the rural areas they don't depend on money, government, services a lot as of now anyway.   I can see agrarian community level groups doing no worse, or perhaps even better than now (still plenty of heath and education issues etc. but at least they can eat.)  Marginal areas will be tricky, as will areas that have taken a one way path to monocrops. 

The worst hit areas will be the lower income urban areas where, as you say, the government has no capacity for UBI, those that provide substantial lower value outsourced services (sales, helpdesk, IT maintenance) abroad will be devastated, because the change will come too fast to adapt and it is too big an economic hole to fill.

Those areas are where riots are easily triggered - like in Jakarta now - and most of those governments will use excessive force which will inevitably escalate the riots and use of force, I do not see any path to a positive outcome.

It is a genuinely terrifying situation to consider.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Even from the first world, I find it rather naïve. 

Democracy (where all get a tiny bit of political power and can use that to further their interests) is a very recent thing. It's only from around first to second world wars that universal suffrage became a thing. 

Before that it was commonly by property ownership. One needed economic power to be allowed voting rights. 

It is when economic power is frustrated, that most revolutions happen. Large part of why the French revolution happened was the new economically powerful bourgeois group was completely denied any political power under the ancien regime.

So in the future, political power (and the use of it for redistribution) will follow economic power. There will be no benevolent for the masses UBI scheme, at most some bread and circuses to keep them placated.</div>

Today, 10% of the US population makes up 50% of all money spending.

Do you see the government cutting out checks to even things out? No, cuz the rich is propping up the economy just fine.

Basically, most of the US population is redundant and unnecessary for the economy. When AI really ramps up and that same top 10% makes up 80%+ of all money spending instead, it will transition just fine.

The goal of UBI is basically give the bare minimum so the poors don't revolt. We are talking food stamps type things, where you get easily rejected for filling out the paperwork wrong.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Do you really think they’re gonna do universal basic income?

We’re so greedy as humans that they’re gonna pocket that money instead of keeping people fed and alive.

Just look at what they’re doing right now with every single opportunity that they have to better people, they decide to just pocket the money.

The real debate here isn’t whether their universal basic income as possible, the debate is whether human failures will allow us to care about another human as much as everybody wants us to

Edit - fam I say this with a lot of love but you all need to step out of your bubble and zoom out and look at everything holistically.

You all have survivorship bias, where you think the way the world you experience it is the way that other people experience it.

One of the arguments in my comments is that if we can have access to free, clean, drinking water, then we can have access to UBI

If you didn’t know this, I think only 70% of the world has access to free and clean drinking water. 

If we can’t even give the world free and clean, drinking water, what makes anybody think we can do UBI? 

And before you say That’s “Third World countries”

The United States, the branded greatest company/country in the world only has 97% access to clean and free drinking water LOL. 

So please take time to step out of your bubble and look at things from the perspective of other people. It’s gonna save you a lot mental gymnastics.</div>

"China is pursuing a distinct strategy in artificial intelligence compared to the United States. While U.S. tech companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google are heavily investing in developing **artificial general intelligence (AGI)** that surpasses human intelligence, China, under Xi Jinping’s direction, is instead focusing on **practical applications**: tools that are affordable, enhance productivity, and address real-world needs in sectors like agriculture, policing, healthcare, and manufacturing.

This strategy is state-backed and emphasizes **open-source development**, and is designed to sidestep the limitations imposed by U.S. semiconductor export restrictions. Although some Chinese entities are interested in AGI, Beijing currently appears risk-averse and favors immediate, incremental gains that support stability and efficiency.""</div>

I mean, in fairness. We've seen these examples of use cases in Google's AI products they've been shipping. 

I'd argue Microsoft is working on improving their copilot as best they can. Among other stuff. 

Like, yeah. These companies are investing in getting to AGI. But they're also developing usable products. I'd argue AI Mode, AI overviews, Gemini/copilot/Chatgpt, are all usable and practical products. 

Google has their AlphaEarth, AlphaEvolve, AlphaFold. As well as the satellite to track fires thing. 

So these big tech are certainly making usable products. The startups like OpenAI and anthropic and others are building only for AGI to an extent.</div>

What do you mean "now"? What "people"? Just 5 years ago most expert AGI preditions were in the 2040s or later and now a lot more say early 2030s, so if anything predictions have been adjusted optimistically.</div>

Edit: Demis Hassabis for instance says we will have something that will mimic AGI in the next 5-10 years and that was said this year. Sam Altman and other AI heads have moved the goalpost recently as well.</div>

My brother Ben has a rare neurological condition that left him quadriplegic and nonverbal. For years, most of the assistive tech out there didn’t really fit his needs. The phrase boards were uninspired, the keyboards were clunky, and honestly he didn’t enjoy using them. He mostly stuck with yes/no answers.

I switched to learning Mandarin recently and it is all or nothing with accent and therefore tone. If I'm having a conversation in English about Mandarin it *will not* inject tone into example phrases no matter how I ask. If we "switch to mandarin" it starts speaking in advanced Mandarin and I couldn't possibly keep up with my meager 3 months of Duolingo.</div>

Haven't heard of that one but Chinese tires have gotten better lately, 

gt radial, saliun, lexani are acceptable, they're no Michelin but its not like 10yrs ago where you will fly off in even the slightest rain. 

and then kumho (Korean, but acquired by the Chinese) is genuinely good depending on the model</div>

That sounds like a good way to mitigate bias. Incomplete, sure, but if it’s random, then it’s less biased</div>

But when Australians protest against immigration as they did yesterday in the march for Australia they are labeled as "right wing extremist neo nazis that want to destroy democracy".

This phenomenon can be seen across the entire world. When Third World countries limit immigration or deport Millions its cool.

 I’ve been applying for jobs in the EU for 3 years and not once have I had a single interview. I even applied for a PhD position in France and got rejected because of “not sufficient recommendation.”

Every time I apply for a Schengen visa, I’m buried in endless bureaucracy and useless paperwork.

Meanwhile, all the thugs and lowlives I know from my town are in France and Germany illegally, living off government expenses without even working.

This is why Europe is fucked, they reject and make the process impossible for legal skilled immigrants, but open their doors and spread their legs for the scum of the earth then complain about how fucked up their countries are becoming.</div>

It's by design. Make its so difficult to do legally that it only leaves the illegal option available.  These people are the easiest to exploit. 

In the meantime the media  paint the picture they are all here on benefits, which is partially true, as they end up doing both, taking jobs from the working class and tax money as well.
