Make this moment a positive one. 'yes! I noticed I was off track! Now to return to my breath'. That positive reinforcement trains your mind to notify you're off track sooner and sooner.

If you find yourself unmotivated in your practice, spend some time thinking about your reason why. What fuels you to practice? Don't answer that question immediately. Think on it until you find something that lights your fire.

In a hectic world that demands so much of us, meditation is a gift of calm and stillness. All it asks for is sincere presence.</div>

The words ‘mindfulness’ and ‘meditation’ have these hidden assumptions that it’s meant to be all zen and peaceful and happy and good. But scrap all that. Who said it was meant to be easy? And who says that because it’s hard, you’re doing it wrong? You’re training your mind the same way you would train weights. Each time you successfully lift a weight, it’s a win even if you immediately drop it. Each time you turn back to your breath, even if just for .0001 seconds, it’s a win.</div>

Pets go lost every year due to being scared and running away from fireworks. Keep your pets inside, or leashed and safe. Even if you live in an area where fireworks are illegal because people will still set them off. Same goes for New Year’s Eve.</a></div>

Every lost animal I have found *never* had a number to call. Collar with no or only a rabies tag, wearing a tshirt and no collar, no michrochip, every time. 

Write it in sharpie directly on the collar if you have to. Municipal usually shelters have government business hours, so someone needs to know who to call if your dog is found.</div>

What do you know, our front door didn't latch properly and blew open when we were out to dinner. Ignored the first call from a number I didn't recognize, and by the time I got the message, this sweetheart was taking my pup home, put him inside and closed the door. He had a complete adventure without us, and we wouldn't have even known without the phone call or ring footage.

                                <div class="reply-body">Personally I think it's better to work with the bar over and over until you've got the form. But it's true that as the weight gets heavier certain parts of it are easier to understand... Like the whole concept of pulling yourself under the bar to catch in that squat position doesn't make as much sense until you really have to do it in order to receive the weight. If you're just doing it with a bar and there's nothing much to catch, It can be more difficult to figure out where your body needs to go. But we continue warming up and drilling with that PVC and empty barbell without shame. When the form is perfect then you're able to do the bigger weight.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Your heels are coming up very early and you're shifting your body weight onto your forefoot quite early. Like you're wanting to jump.

In weightlifting we don't want to jump though. When we jump we shift our centre if gravity forwards into the forefoot. And when we accelerate an object upwards, any shift of mass in a horizontal direction will cause the object to get horizontal momentum as well. That's why the bar gets so far away from you.

When 'jump' is used as a cue in learning the snatch the emphasis is also put on air time. On being in the air.

That is not our goal in weightlifting though. In German weightlifting terminology we don't talk about the action of separating foot and floor as a jump but we call it "Fußversatz" which emphasizes that we're only doing this to move our feet a little bit outwards. (And it's also just a byproduct of explosively extending knees and hips)

Try to stay on your whole foot for a whole lot longer. Accelerate through your knees and hips.</div>

I love that you don't use the jumping cue - I struggled some with the snatch until I figured out that you're really not trying to jump at all. I was really trying to jump! Because they kept saying to jump. There is no jumping... There's just a shuffling of the foot outward to reset. You're just shifting it kind of like a dance move so that you can catch it in a better position. Once I figured this out it was like the heavens opened. But people need to stop saying the word jump! And start saying... Fußversatz!</div>

I'm not sure how this whole endeavor will go, I have my doubts, and believe there are better options for the food crisis (using funds to heavily subsides health food options like fruits vegetables dairy and eggs). But something needs to be done about the soaring cost of food and tbh im glad to see its actually being addressed.</div>

We don't have many instances of walls being smart TVs today except for the Dome in Vegas and maybe some other instances. Jewelry is an iffy yes, but only because smart watches are a thing, but there's little other smart jewelry out there. I'm sure there's some LED earrings out there that can be paired to a phone to display other images and there was some artist that made a Bladerunner-like nail things, but I've never seen those in real life and I don't think anyone's really interested in that stuff for this decade at least.

The car one should've been pushed back to early 30s. Self-driving cars are making a lot of progress, but there's no way most cars are going to be automated by 2030. Maybe semi-trucks on highways, but even that would be super bullish.</div>

There's no trace of involvement. And if you ask them in court they have to answer "I can neither confirm or deny their involvement with _______", you could ask about anyone and get the same answer. 

That's why I thought it was ridiculous everyone freaked out about that one J6 guy that got that answer in court and they used it as evidence they were, along with the confirmation of assets, and people not knowing the different between asset and agent</div>

Their goal is to literally fill Facebook with fake users that will feel real and also keep you on. Many people don't like people that are too needy, constant messages every time you open your app would actually cause those people to leave the app.

I think the main goal here is for the AI to identify the sweet spot for different people.</div>

If they’re training models, my bet is it’s traditional ML for the trigger, with the text content written by gen AI obviously.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, i also don't get how that should be related to training.  
The main issue here to solve is that LLMs are stateless. They have no 'awareness' about time.  
And to implement that you could timestamp every reply. The question is just if the LLM will pick up on it. But maybe that can be done with a clever system prompt. But to make the chat more immersive it could then reply: "Last week you asked XYZ." Or lets say you told the LLM that tomorrow you have a job interview, and the day after the LLM would be aware of the passed time and ask: "How was the job interview?"   
I'm actually playing around with that right now and am working on context injection, like making the LLM aware of time and the current weather.   
But yeah training has nothing to do with that.</div>

o3 Pro is even better than the old o3, but I get like 4 interactions with o3 pro before it’s rate limited for the next month.

                        <div class="comment-body">Oh so it's not only me. O3 became DUMB. I was really impressed at the beginning.

Today I repeated some convos from that time. This idiot tried to convince me that I'm lying. It's process involved things like "user thinks blabla. He is clearly delusional. I ignore his input and find the proper solution" and then "for some reason user insists on blabla. Maybe I should check it. But I already found user is delusional. I'll ignore his input again"

It took him 12 minutes to get out of it's arse and try to convince me that's something I told it cannot be true. It didn't even make a strong case about it, it didn't go deep dive as usual. I felt like I was talking with 9 yo child that stuck to his fantasies.

Even simple fact checking was off. Then it started to hallucinate.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's not an "OS," that's just marketing fluff for VC money.

It's just a repackage of existing open-source browser automation tools with LLMs.

They just take an existing Linux distro and let you install "apps" (which are just shortcuts to the browser version of that "app" - like Spotify web, Outlook web, etc. Not real apps, just PWAs).

Then, they use one of many open-source "browser automation with AI" frameworks.

Spend some effort marketing on a mountain with all the free time you get from using existing open-source stuff, and VC money starts rolling in.</div>

I don’t understand the obsession with the 5.7 Hemi. It’s a low output, low revving truck engine, that isn’t even loud, and it’s in a pickup truck. They’re not fun to drive or fast like a 392 Challenger.</div>

But people like it for a simple reason... it sounds good. IMO probably the best sounding of the V8s left in the trucks. No, its not quick. The Hurricane in standard output is quite a bit quicker and HO is much, much quicker. But the Hemi sounds good.

You don't need to drive aggressively or quickly to enjoy the sound. Though as far as trucks I'd say the Ram 1500 is still the best riding.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s not so cut and dry imo. I wouldn’t bet against Googles TPUs ultimately winning out. We already know that ASICs are better than GPUs for inference. And thinking models are basically all inference and the industry is heading towards scaling thinking more than training. 

Now Nvidia does layer AI specific architecture onto their GPUs but I still think more specialized architecture will win. But if that is the case I’m sure Nvidia can easily create something to compete there. 

Now Nvidia has the advantage of their software stack and flexibility (since ASICs are not flexible for rapid model development like we have now), but as the pace of model training slows and inference workloads grow (due to increased thinking usage and diminishing returns on training), Nvidia’s advantages become less important and squeezing out hardware efficiency becomes the name of the game. 

I’m just saying the bet needs to be on who is winning the inference wars and currently it’s a lot closer than the training wars which makes Nvidia less of a sure thing. If Nvidia or Google or another company start dominating inference, that is the best investment move in my opinion. 

TL;DR: As inference becomes the dominant workload, the value of flexibility and general-purpose architecture that Nvidia provides diminishes, and the spotlight shifts to efficient, inference-optimized silicon that other companies are much closer to Nvidia on</div>
