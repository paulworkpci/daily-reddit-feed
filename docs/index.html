You have to use the :free endpoint for using free provider, so the model name would be "moonshotai/kimi-k2:free".

If you want to use Chutes, you have to also set your privacy setting to enable data training and logging because it's a shady endpoint.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It doesn't matter. My grandfather died after being on life support for a couple days. He was a former crackhead and current alcoholic, and also his organs had bone shrapnel in them. Didn't stop the organ vultures. Apparently if someone is on life support the hospital is legally required to notify these evil organizations who call and harass family members about harvesting their organs. 

The hospital called to ask whether we wanted to pull the plug. We said that we wanted to think about it for a day. That afternoon, we got a call from the organ people asking us to confirm that they would be harvesting his organs tomorrow at 10:00. We told them to fuck off and then called the hospital to ask why these people think they are going to be harvesting organs tomorrow morning. The doctor said he had no idea and tried to revoke whatever consent was automatically granted on the hospital side, and was promptly threatened with evil organ lawyers.

The organ vultures called to harass us several more times, including 45 minutes before we were due to pull the plug. They tried various flavors of trickery to make us consent. Also, they called it "anatomical gifting." 

It is one thing to have this happen with your crackhead grandfather from whom you are basically estranged, but they are presumably doing this to everyone. If they wanted my grandfather's failing ass cut up nasty organs that badly then just imagine what they do to like, teenagers in car wrecks. They really are unfathomably evil.</div>

The weird thing is, I don't believe an official AI IMO contest was set up for this year. Tao said there were plans to, but not for this year, and wishes for it to be done properly next year.

I see a bunch of people essentially complaining that OpenAI didn't follow the rules while other AI companies did, but there *were no rules or official competition for AI this year*.

Edit: https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1947082140279091456?t=gYvcna5YEgE61evobLsFLw&amp;s=19

Apparently the IMO reached out a few months ago to provide Lean versions of the problems immediately after the competition ended, but OpenAI declined because they weren't going to do Lean for this.

Reading into this, I am expecting that all the other AI labs who participated and "followed the rules" are using Lean, and that's what they mean by "cooperating with the IMO". Formal language and likely math specialized AI models. Since OpenAI declined, they didn't have much communications with them after the fact. I wonder if OpenAI will have the only natural language model (for the record I think if Google is using a specialized math model for this, then they'll probably beat OpenAI's score, but I think a general model doing this may be more impressive).</div>

what I think is that the chatGPT agent announcement was so lackluster that they felt the need to announce something 'new' to make up for it

they go on twitter to vague post and hype up useless shit about 'feeling the AGI' then drop the IMO results IN A TWITTER POST without any IMO official certification

idk how their European market brands are doing (~~Dacia~~ Skoda, Seat, etc), but their situation in the US and China is really not good. VW is in tatters, Porsche sales are down and they're doing a U-turn on their strategy, Bentley's profits are down by half vs 2022, and the title describes Audi.


I'm not sure how exactly they managed for their premium brands to stagnate at the same time, but the big conglomerate that spans the entire price range of the car industry isn't looking so strong right now IMO. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly, the current RAV4 is a miserable place to be. I rented one and was surprised at how much I disliked it. The engine sounds like a Briggs &amp; Stratton from a lawnmower, the cabin is super loud, the ride isn’t great and the interior—with the tacked-on screen and giant HVAC knobs—feels like you’re driving a cheap Fisher-Price toy. The seats were bad and the driving position was poor.

Even though the hybrid powertrain solves some of the car’s problems, I still can’t believe it sells as well as it does when cars like the CRV, Tiguan, and Forester are in the same class.</div>

v0 is the go to if you are focusing on the UI. You could import from Figma. With design mode, you can just do design on top of web code.

Replit is the most vibe coding friendly I've seen so far. If you are not interest or know vibe coding thing, may as well as skip this.

If you want to explore more, Bolt.new and Loveable.dev also support have Figma import.

There is also a Figma MCP server that you can use with any AI tools.

With the right prompt, any AI tools can do the job.</div>

AI performance varies drastically based on testing conditions (time, tools, assistance, etc.), just like how IMO contestants could go from bronze to gold medal performance with different support. Therefore, comparing AI capabilities or AI vs human performance is meaningless without standardized testing methodology.

He also did not mention OpenAI at all. In fact, reading between the lines, where he says 

&gt; one should be wary of making apples-to-apples comparisons between the performance of various AI models

suggests that he knows *multiple* AI labs will be reporting results for the IMO and none of their numbers will be comparable to each other. This includes figures from Google and xAI about the USAMO from their livestreams as well as numbers from MathArena.

In fact, I'd wager that he was talking more specifically about Google because of these two points:

&gt; One gives the students several days to complete each question, rather than four and half hours for three questions. (To stretch the metaphor somewhat, consider a sci-fi scenario in the student is still only given four and a half hours, but the team leader places the students in some sort of expensive and energy-intensive time acceleration machine in which months or even years of time pass for the students during this period.)

&gt; Before the exam starts, the team leader rewrites the questions in a format that the students find easier to work with.

where Google's AlphaProof had 3 days to do a problem and had everything formalized to Lean beforehand.

&gt; Each of the six students on the team submit solutions, but the team leader selects only the "best" solution to submit to the competition, discarding the rest.

This one is probably talking about MathArena giving each model 32 tries and selecting the best answer from a 32 bracket tournament.


When people do things like that, the numbers are no longer comparable.

Edit: I see another AI model's results on the IMO are scheduled to be announced in a few days. People won't understand what Tao is talking about until next week (because he doesn't specify OpenAI) when we see like half a dozen or more AI models' reports on the IMO and realize that they're all doing the contest differently so the scores and capabilities of the models can't be compared apples to apples.

Edit: Terence Tao edited his post. I was correct, he was not talking about OpenAI

&gt; EDIT: In particular, the above comments are not specific to any single result of this nature.</div>

DeepSeek R1 (671B) delivers the best results: 73.2% pass@1 on HumanEval, 69.8% on MBPP, and around 49.2% on SWE Verified tasks in DevOps tests. Magistral, though not built specifically for coding, holds its own thanks to strong reasoning abilities, scoring 59.4% on LiveCodeBench v5. It's slightly behind DeepSeek and Codestral in pure code tasks.

Devstral (24B) is optimized for real-world, agent-style coding tasks rather than tradit...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Since it seems like there's people misunderstanding the point of this, a summary:

* IMO Officials asked AI companies to wait a week after the competition to announce their results so that the kids could have their chance in the spotlight, knowing that an AI putting on a medal level performance would take all the headlines.
* OpenAI weren't officially working with IMO, and it seems other AI companies, possibly Google Deepmind, were. It doesn't mean OpenAI's AI didn't perform as they said, it was just done in an unofficial setting and hasn't been confirmed by IMO themselves.</div>

Except that the screenshot posted in the tweet doesn't back that up at all. It says that in their opinion they should have waited a week, but apparently no one ever actually asked them to do that. 

&gt;OpenAI weren't officially working with IMO

Again, the source quoted said they didn't think OpenAI was one of the companies, it wasn't something they knew for a fact.

OpenAI does not have that sort of trust anymore. There are reasons not to trust them too openly, lets say. And it's annoying for them to conduct this whole thing thus.</div>

– Want to read more? Just read one page before bed.

With so much misinformation being spread regarding these results (for example, Terence Tao incorrectly saying the model had access to tools, insinuated that the AI model got more time to complete the task and also that they were fed the questions in a different format, none of which were true, and also this "they announced it beforee the ceremony ended!") I want to validate all these claims myself. I am not sure why, but people seem to just make shit up in regards to this topic. It's like people WANT the model or OpenAI to be bad so they don't care about the truth. Just make shit up to try and rile people up.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think it’s a little bit of one, a little bit of the other situation.

If you know that AGI is near in the “AI-2027” sense, then you probably want to get as much cash as possible as quickly as possible. Or, more accurately, ownership of things that will remain scarce. Such as land, the blue chip companies that will stick around due to various moats, etc.

Because in most scenarios, a post-ASI world kind of involves everyone getting locked into their current social strata/standing… forever. Maybe things get better for the everyone along the hierarchy, but if your own work/ingenuity/education is no longer an enabler of mobility, because the big corporations will have ASI that is better than you in absolutely every way, then any chance you have of social influence (and essentially maintaining your own free will) going forward is going to be about what you’ve maintained control of from the “before-times” lol.

EDIT: So there's no doubt a lot of internal debate going on. Maybe they do think that their OpenAI shares would be worth more than Meta's offer if they achieve ASI first, but are freaked out that the timeline for any liquidity is very unknown. There are also risks surrounding nationalization, etc, if things get way out of hand. Meanwhile, Meta's offering a guaranteed vesting schedule that you are free to diversify at will in the public market -- so that might be seen as more valuable even though the top-line number is lower.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">You can meditate, anywhere, anytime you want. Indoors, outdoors, kitchen, bedroom, prison, your alter space. Location is not an issue.

Also I believe that time is not an issue either. I see 5 minutes as better than not at all. They say that the longer the better...
But we're all not there yet. 

More practice is good. But to put off meditation because you don't have 30 minutes right now is not good either. Better to take, 2 minutes progressive relaxation, then maybe 5 minutes, you might forget to stop at 5 minutes one day as 30 minutes slips by.

Your level of dedication is just fine. If you were not dedicated... You would not have written this post.

Good luck and enjoy your practice.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Maybe the question to be asking right now is 'why do I keep falling out of my practice' if the meditation area doesn't seem to be the problem. Are you trying to sit for too long? are you judging yourself when your mind wanders? The 'am I not dedicated enough' question at the end of your post makes me think some kind of self judgment might be it. It's no fun to tell yourself 'I'm no good at this and it's showing me how I lack discipline,' that would make me want to meditate less too.</div>

If Zuck has a chance to tip the scales in the next trillion+ industry, it's not so outlandish.

Not remotely outlandish. On the contrary, it'd be insane if the amount of these payouts *weren't* being invested for this project. When you actually realize this will be a trillion+ industry, this is palpably ho-hum.

This reason is why I had to fight with a bunch of people at first who said, with astounding levels of confidence, *"Sam's lying!!! Meta offering 8 digits for researchers is absurd!!!"* That felt like half the sub. I'm not hearing much from them now.

Even if Sam were actually a bad person, the pendulum tips the base off the table in people's vitriol of him, leading many people to have terrible judgment and complete bankruptcy of what ought to be very obvious intuition. You can dislike the guy without making it your identity, such that you have to disagree with him even when he's making completely plausible claims. It's truly okay, you'll be alright if you put the virtue signal down and think a bit. Sheesh. Anyway, that's my rant.</div>
