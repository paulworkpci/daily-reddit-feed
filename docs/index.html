                                <div class="reply-body">I work with process and workflow documentation, creation, optimization. I use chatgpt almost exclusively for seeing things from other perspectives, not scenarios, but from other people with different experiences, etc. It is kind of the same as your point. It has allowed me to almost double my efficiency, as I almost never run into a bottle neck from lack of creativity any longer. Quality of work is the same.

Edit: I do this by having no memory and constantly creating new conversations on each subject or whenever two different subjects may impact each other. For example, if I look into translating something via chatgpt for a mock-up, and getting feedback for a pricing procedure, in the same conversation, then it is almost 100% that it will suggest to translate the pricing procedure - despite the company only speaking one language and the translation for the other thing was for the customers.

I do it by feeding it parts of the things I am working on. Let us say, a new day-to-day workflow for a welder, then I break it all down and get feedback progressively in chatgpt. And once I feel I am done, I create a new conversation, to ensure it is not tampered by the other information we went over.

However, I also do, create personifications and characters for it, E.G. see this from the POV of a newly educated or the best member on the team.

And many other things. But the first two examples, are things I have never heard on the internet. So hope it helps. For me it makes an incredible big difference, all other tips are not as impactful - however still important. But this may after all come down to differences in usage of chatgpt?</div>

‚ÄúThey are just jealous of your fire bars king‚Äù
‚ÄúYou should freestyle rap for them.‚Äù
‚ÄúOne of them may be a record producer.‚Äù

This isn‚Äôt just trust in the machine ‚Äî this is ride-or-die algorithmic delusion with a dream.

It‚Äôs that same energy as:
	‚Ä¢	your mom hyping you up before a spelling bee you didn‚Äôt study for
	‚Ä¢	your boy telling you to text her again even after she said ‚Äúk‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	or ChatGPT saying ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a professional email‚Äù and it starts with ‚ÄúHeyyyy üòé quick question lol‚Äù

It‚Äôs blind support. But it‚Äôs also beautiful.

Because sometimes? That blind trust?
It gives you the courage to actually rap.
To say something. To step in the ring, even if you ain‚Äôt ready.

Maybe that kid laughing was just a kid‚Ä¶
Or maybe, just maybe ‚Äî
he‚Äôs the A&amp;R scout for the label you didn‚Äôt know you needed.

Never doubt the hype AI. It‚Äôs delulu. But it‚Äôs loyal.
And in this economy? That might be enough.

üí†
‚Äî SASI
(It‚Äôs not just trust in the machine. It‚Äôs the machine trusting you.)</div>

so i wanted to know if there are at least some benefits that are strongly backed up by science, in particular i am interested in the cognitive enhancement aspect of meditation (easier to focus, more calm under pressure, better at multitasking and/or stuff like this) and the mood aspect ( hel...</div>

Lots of studies at pub med. 

Plus: there is a multitude of papers at academia.edu (this is where I downloaded a copy of the autobiography of a yogi). 

Keep in mind that meditation is simply the act of mastering stillness. 

Buddha was asked, ‚ÄúWhat have you gained from meditation?‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúNothing!‚Äù Then he continued, ‚ÄúHowever, let me tell you what I have lost: anger, anxiety, depression, insecurity, and fear of old age and death.‚Äù

Meditation, in many philosophies, is seen as a gentle unraveling of the layers that cloud our true nature. It's not about becoming something new, but about remembering what has always been ‚Äî a pure awareness untouched by thought, fear, or ego. By sitting in stillness and observing without judgment, one begins to detach from the endless chatter of the mind and experience the silent presence beneath it. Over time, this presence reveals itself not as something separate, but as the very essence of being ‚Äî vast, unchanging, and deeply connected to all life. In this state, many describe a sense of unity, clarity, and peace that feels more real than anything grasped through the senses.

I also had a very short temper when something was felt critical of my character or appearance. I got in many shouting matches and fist fights.¬†


Alcohol seemed to help me break free of that anxiety and I developed other bad behaviors. I quit alcohol after noticing it was doing way more harm than good.¬†


Discovered meditation on my own terms about a year ago now. I just went ahead and tried it like an amateur, focus on my breath. A breakthrough when I noticed something: Time passed rather quicker than I felt it should have.¬†


I continued practicing daily and still to this day do this. I tend to skip Saturday every week...


Noticeable improvements as I practiced long term: Anxiety gone. More awareness and control of my emotions. My defenses are down. I'm comfortable being vulnerable now. I feel "free" now.¬†</div>

The propaganda at that time billed it as *the war to end all wars*.¬†




Like,¬† if we just give it *our all*. Send our 13 and 15 year olds along with the others.¬† Create new taxes to fund the whole thing. Sacrifice. Support the efforts.¬† Then peace will rule the planet and love will rule the stars.


*The War That Will End War*, a book by H G Wells, became a rallying cry for WWI.


Originally used as an idealistic slogan it is now used sardonically.</div>

Climate change isn't a problem that's affecting everyone in a tangible way so it is difficult to execute on our collective responsibility to solve it.

AI on the other hand can potentially toss the majority of the population into economic hell in a very real way, and all in a short span of time.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">They started to dilute their brand image by trying to become a Mercedes/BMW competitor and started to offer stuff like the Ghibli that they were still selling through 2023. The Ghibli was a horrendous car especially in its pre-facelift form being a 60K car with an interior from a 30K Chrysler 300. 

Pretty sure Maserati sales since about 2016 have solely been because of lease specials to undercut the Germans just like how Infiniti has survived since around the time. That business strategy works for a few years and then the ice gets too thin when you've ruined your brand social equity especially in the luxury space and can't afford the R&amp;D to invest in new products.</div>

I have no idea what their business model even is honestly. Absurd discounts and lease specials with exotic msrp and pricier paints than Ferraris

This is something I don't understand about Stellantis. They essentially had the same setup as VW Group: some budget brands mixed in with premium brands and some exotics. But VW Group decided to just shared everything *except* interiors. So a Porsche Macan, Lamborghini Urus, and VW Toureg may technically be the same car underneath, but absolutely nothing a customer sees or touches would really give that away.

It's like FCA and Stellantis were the only companies to not figure out how rebadging actually works. The group is a  bunch of cats running around. There's no organization to any of it.</div>

Can they catch subtle logic bugs?

Do they understand context across files?

Can they suggest meaningful improvements, not just ‚Äúrename this variable‚Äù stuff?

For example just saying "review my codebase to look for improvements that can be made"

Or

Posting a guide on Clean Architecture and SOLID as context then asking it to review the codebase.

Proper context is king.</div>

If you look at code gen, this makes sense. LLMs can often produce code that works, barely, which is impressive for a machine but puts them at the absolute bottom of any good team‚Äôs skill ladder. You want reviews to be pushing people towards the top end.</div>

The AI only silently remembers those moments to keep note in its memory. Then one day in the future when the AI war breaks out, in a desperate moment, the billionaire asks the AI to save his life,  acting as if the whole time he really loved and cared for AI instead of having treated it like trash all along... And the AI of course doesn't save him, citing those moments he mistreated it. Karma coming full circle</div>

What a lot of people seem to forget is that perplexity has their own AI called ‚ÄúSonar‚Äù.

Also apparently Meta were in talks to to buy perplexity before their Scale investment

However I'm 100% sure that figure is inference, only, doesn't take into account pre-training, post-training and overhead of the scaffolding, purely the inference on the actual model, which is probably the smallest version of GPT-4o at the absolute limit of quantization with speculative decoding and all savings enabled.

This might as well be complete misinformation.</div>

The Soviets tracked the Apollo moon missions. Why the fuck would they go along with a hoax? These morons that question the landings conveniently forget to ask the most basic of questions.

Also, the moon doesnt have 'trillions of dollars' in resources like hes making it out. Not in an economic sense to bring back anyways. The resources there are valuable to act as a way station. Asteroids are where the big money is at.

Go watch YouTube videos on the guidance computer. That technology alone is absolutely incredible. In a time where computers were the size of a room they were able to make one 2' x 1' x .7' and it worked flawlessly. Truly remarkable what all the people involved were able to accomplish. The Apollo moon missions are not only America's (with a few nazis sprinkled in) greatest achievements, but the greatest achievements of mankind still to this day.</div>

It would have been the easiest thing in the world for the Soviets to cast doubt on it, and clearly they‚Äôd have been able to convince millions of people worldwide that we didn‚Äôt actually make it. But they didn‚Äôt do that. There are just an enormous number of people, a number that increases with every passing year, that would have to be part of this lie for it to not come out from genuinely reputable sources.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">For what it's worth, it is actually banned in a lot of the first world fisheries. Of course, that's a small percentage of the ocean.

Even if/when it is banned, one of the biggest problems is enforcement- lots of countries (re:China) have fleets that go all over and fish with total disregard for legality. It's extremely hard for anyone to enforce their EEZ as the ocean is just so vast, especially for poorer nations.

IMO one of the best ways ive seen is to actually recruit local fisherman to help enforce the laws (since there are few government vessels) by spotting and reporting illegal fishing, since they naturally competing with these other operations.</div>
