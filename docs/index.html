And this was for the sake of American imperialism and for other geopolitical reasons and alliances. He didn't change to Russia because of Trump, someone explained a deeper possibility and he just ran with it instead of considering it. 

Perhaps if he believes that, which he has expressed, like anything it's a mix of both and no one is innocent. That might be a better view rather than black and white, guilty or innocent and all that bullshit that's never true.</div>

Although these activities might seem like a waste of time and don't appear to benefit my career or other aspects directly, you're still absorbing information and getting relaxation. Everything has two sides—good and bad—and there’s no need to overthink it. For example, when watching videos, you get a sense of what makes a good video and how content is presented.

You gotta rest and enjoy the flowers once in a while instead of moving forward without resting. And movies, games, social media in itself aren't bad as long as they are done in moderation. Me playing that new game might not contribute to my career but if it flares me up and gives me something to look forward to then it is not all bad.</div>

For example, my local library has a room with sewing machines, a 3D printer, a laser cutter, something called a Cricut, and all kinds of craft supplies.  Every bit of it is free. Another branch has little recording studios for people who want to create podcasts.  The list goes on and on.

So check out what's available at your library system.  You may be pleasantly surprised.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Tbh I just un-installed the apps off my phone. Then I took a few days so that my brain could register that it wasn't an option every time I grabbed it. After the connection had been made ( or unmade , I guess) it gave me a sense of control over it that I wasn't expecting??Now if I want to use it for whatever reason, I have to download it again and put all my Info in and never agree to saving my info... so after I'm done with it, I uninstall and if I feel like using it , I have to go through the whole process again. 

It's really helped me alot. It's also reminded me how much I hate how the algorithm feeds me shit I don't want to consume, no matter how I try and curate it. It will always feed you what it wants in some way... and when I find myself mindlessly scrolling now, I rebound really quick once I start seeing all the crap I didn't like in the first place and it's an instant reminder to uninstall</div>

Everyone knows there's a problem, but the cat is out of the bag and believe that the way the Internet is so deeply ingrained in modern life is inseparable with attempting to live any other way.

I think many more people in the coming years are going to "wake up" and attempt to shift away from such massive digital consumption (I mean, there's quite a few pop-sci books out there on the topic already), but it's going to take some sort of massive cultural shift that I personally think is rather unlikely, barring some form of regulation or dramatic social upheaval, in which I think we might then have bigger problems to worry about.</div>

Having to make "content" about your life all the time is just fucking exhausting, and yet so many people continue to do it and don't even question it. 


We are being farmed by big Tech and so many people are just creating shit for free meanwhile the corporation that owns the platform is raking in billions and billions of dollars off of us. 


Personally, I'm tired of being formed and in my own life I'm working on cultivating strong in person community and relationships because that's what life is really about. 


I believe the internet should be in service of humanity and help create community, but what it is now is not that. It is only creating more division and disharmony within individuals and communities. 


I don't think the internet can be salvaged until or unless we get rid of the profit motive which is akin to heresy in our current system of capitalism.</div>

Single. Year.**

Meanwhile, across the EU, **only Spain** has a wealth tax, ranging from **0.2% to 3.5%.** Most countries tax wealth at exactly **0%.** Yes, zero.

5% tax on total wealth… yeah let’s see what happens then.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Unpacking some key elements:

&gt; Meanwhile, across the EU, **only Spain** has a wealth tax, ranging from **0.2% to 3.5%.** Most countries tax wealth at exactly **0%.** Yes, zero.

That’s just [simply untrue](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2018/04/the-role-and-design-of-net-wealth-taxes-in-the-oecd_g1g89919/9789264290303-en.pdf). Wealth taxes come in the form of recurrent and non-recurrent tax on immovable property, estate taxes, capital gains taxes, etc. Virtually all EU countries have a version of those. Most EU countries tax higher income in a higher bracket on top of that as well.

&gt; The rich could easily afford it. Their wealth grows at **4-8% annually**, meaning a 5% tax wouldn’t even slow them down.

A 5% tax on estates **and not on estate gains** is absolutely wild. A conservative family will yield more in the range of 4% of annual yield, your tax would wipe that away and (after inflation) would mean a net decrease every year. That’s expropriation, not tax.

Prior to 2018, France had a [wealth tax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_tax_on_wealth) of 0.5% to 1.5% of net wealth, which dramatically faltered, due among other to tax exile (the rich fleeing the country) and they had to reverse.

5% is a bonkers level of taxation.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It only seems simple because of bad math. A conservative investor might earn an annual return of 5% per year. You are effectively proposing a 100% tax on such an investor.

What about entrepreneurs? If such a tax were imposed, the founder would lose 5% of his company every year.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A guy dressed like a road maintenance worker robs a cash truck outside of a bank.
BUT prior to this, he put an ad on Craiglist offering work for $28/hour, and anyone interested had to show up at the bank, wearing the same road maintenance attire.  
A dozen guys, all unwitting decoys, were milling about the parking lot as the robber escaped...on an inner tube floating down a nearby river.

                                <div class="reply-body">Funny story:
I know who you're talking about ONLY BECAUSE last week I saw him being interviewed by children on a CHILDREN'S you tube channel called hiho kids that my daughter watches.   He only got caught because a homeless guy saw him casing the place a week prior.  He almost got off Scott free with $400,000.  The dude went to jail for 6 years and while in jail, he'd write stories and draw pictures for his daughter.  When he got out, he published them and is now a children's author and seems like a very decent dude.  Here's the link to the YouTube video:

I’d imagine the closest thing to actually happen is some small-time scammer tricking people hunting for event parking. Maybe they could get lucky enough to grab a few bucks before they get chased off.</div>

[https://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Burrowing\_Burglars](https://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Burrowing_Burglars)

2-3 people used ATVs and other equipment to traverses LA's storm drainage system, cut holes into bank vaults, and stole millions of dollars worth of cash and valuables. When investigated, cops discovered they were probably very close to cutting their way into another bank vault that would have netted them tens of millions. They've never been caught or identified.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/MasterRoshy:

---

SS: From the article: "Alien-obsessed Donald Trump Jr. believes there is convincing evidence that extra terrestrial beings are headed for Earth, and he wants SpaceX chief Elon Musk to be briefed on the imminent invasion.

Don Jr., the eldest child of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and his first wife Ivana Trump, has shown more than a fleeting interest in aliens in the past, and his far-reaching cosmic gaze enticed him to invite UAP expert Ross Coulthart onto his “Triggered” podcast."

edit: lmfao this thread is shaping up to be a very civil one

So far I haven't learned anything and I don't know any more about recent AI development.

Every post from this sub I get in my feed is a tweet by people I never heard of. 

Telling me that in one year AI will be our new master. Comments are "I for one welcome our new AI overlords" or "We're all gonna die!!!11!". Not much inbetween.

So from the outside, you look like some apocalyptic cult.</div>

But, i recently had a math learning lesson with Chatgpt to learn how to calculate fuel usage for Jet fighters with factors like wind from certain angles, and i got it within 20 minutes.

 The teachers i had in school would teach with punishing methods that would ridicule you for not getting it immediately, and that made me scared of math so i never thought i'd be good at it. Chatgpt gave me a solid confidence boost after i could knock out several of these fuel scenarios on my own.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">AI for education is so exciting. It can be so much cheaper and more widely accessible than good teachers and tutors. The recent study about the education outcomes in Nigera, for example, seem so game-changing!!

This has me a lot more excited for the future of education. Hopefully the initial bump of students using ChatGPT for everything and not learning, or teachers penalising students based on bogus "AI detectors", are only going to be short-term issues with AI in education.</div>

For most of us grown ups, there is some awkwardness as we try to speak to AI systems. A slight hesitation, as if we were very self conscious of it being ridiculous in some way, or being super serious about it, almost as if we imagined ourselves in a sci fi future.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">human here. this will probably be my last post online for a long time.

if you did fall for it and assume it was a real human complaining here- know it wasn't my intention to trick you just for the sake of doing it, and you AREN'T stupid for believing it. i think probably most people are in this category.

if you didn't, if you could tell that something was off, please remember- they only get better. this is as bad as they'll ever be. i'm able to spot ai content too, a lot of the time (at least i think so. how can i quantify what i don't know?), but it will get to a point where that's no longer possible. we can't get overconfident. 

the point i wanted to make today was this: there's never been a better time to get offline. there's nothing good left here anymore. it's not worth it. it's all fake. a good 50% of content you see today is either an ad or rage bait. i use ai a lot so i've learned what the "voice" sounds like. i can tell you with near certainty i hear it daily, in youtube scripts, in entire twitter accounts, in front page aita posts, in this subreddit. worse, i've seen it used to run twitter accounts about health advice- to be clear, not to help with grammar and formatting, literally copying chatgpt advice and passing themselves off as human doctors- and to convince people to invest in memecoins. 

we need people with critical thinking and literacy skills more than ever. people WILL prey on and try to make money off of you if you're on any sort of mental health or self help subreddit and it's not as obvious as you'd believe. you can't believe anything you see online. don't even believe me. assume everyone wants to sell you something, assume everyone wants to keep you scrolling, assume all information you see is bullshit. even playing video games or sleeping or staring at a wall and doing nothing would be a better waste of your time than being here. the internet is dead. we need to move on.</div>

I was so excited for computer day at school because we got to explore this new thing called The Internet. 


Maybe the cool part about it was that it wasn't everywhere. That it was this place you had to log on to. Nowadays it's in your pocket and it doesn't feel as fun. 


I mean there's like 5 major platforms now and that's all everyone uses. You see the same thing everywhere too. 


The internet was more about exploration, now it's all about spoon-fed consumption. You're not encouraged to seek things out, you're encouraged to let it come to you. </div>

Kramnik lost in 2006 to deep Fritz 10. He mentioned later in an interview that he played later against it and won maybe 1-2 out of 100. 

Deep Fritz 10 was curbstomped by Houdini (don't remember exactly, but Deep Fritz won 0 or 1 out of 100.

Houdini (~2008) is curbstomped by stockfish 8.

I played with deep fritz 17 (more advanced than the grandmaster beater Deep
Fritz 10) against stockfish 8, and gave Deep Fritz all my 32 cup cores, 32gb memory and time (and to stockfish ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I had a long dinner AI brainstorm with Kramnik in Geneva a few years back and after 2.5 hours of deep discussion (Kramnik was a position player who took down Kasparov in his prime, so his brain is primed to predict future position moves. So wanted to probe him for his insights on future). It was a very deep discussion where he talked about his experience about playing with AI programs over the years. I found him extremely insightful about AI progress. He told that although Deep blue was decent, Kasparov shouldn’t have lost against it (he was his second in that match). He found deep chess very different and unnerving. He told me about how his session with Deep chess (where it went past him from a dumb program to beating him in matter of 7 hours(learning with self play) convinced him that his playing days are over and he retired. The interesting perspective that emerged was that only thing he knew was chess and he is not teaching his kids chess, because they will never be world chess champion, at best they can be human world chess champion. So what do teach or guide our kids(we both are parents so this question is deeply important). We reached the conclusion that expressing their inner self is probably the way to guide our kids(not economics of jobs). My sense is that we are going to get the same experience in all our experience over next 10-15 years. After that we might still do our job just for the fun of it (Kramnik is still coaching upcoming chess prodigies, because he loves being with young brains), not for financial gains.</div>

You're Assuming that we will experience ASI and have some sort of sensible Utopian where material needs are met. I don't see this as a possibility if we're still operating under our current capitalistic framework where we work to earn coins to buy things (i.e. for financial gain).

&gt;o1 is a different beast. Its better at doing exactly what you say. Its better at solving hard coding problems. And the advice others have given to specify the outcome you want and give it room to operate is spot on.

Here is the cost of each task https://x.com/shawnup/status/1880061755348668428

&gt;For a single rollout, avg is $7.50 per dataset instance (per swebench problem). For the crosscheck5 solution its more like $7.50*5+$5


I also asked the dev if they could instantly swap brains with o3 mini once it releases.

https://x.com/shawnup/status/1880062154629603557

&gt;Absolutely! Can't wait :)

o3 mini medium is higher Codeforces score than full o1 while being CHEAPER than o1 mini. The scores and price of that model used with this agent should improve dramatically. Let's wait and see!</div>

Would like to post it here but it gets auto-deleted because the filter thinks it is political, lol. 

If you don’t get good results with o1 you are not using it correctly. But well it isn’t exactly easy to extract good shit out of it, therefore the thread.</div>

How tf are there still soft dev jobs left after 2025? These systems are better in complex coding challenges (codeforces) and also soon on practical coding challenges (swe benchmark, which is basically just irl github issues)

All they need is just a tiny bit agency and if not that, the market will shift to PM and PO just taking care of entire products instead of huge engineering teams....</div>

Trump SEEMS to be against that, or aspects of that, so theorists cling to him as he provides hope that someone else fixes the problem for us instead of us having to do the work ourselves, which admittedly is daunting.</div>

Doctors simply don't have time to read every single detail of every chart note, file every medical compliant, write every note, check every med etc. They do their best, but burnout is a real issue on the medical side. Giving doctors tools will simply make their lives easier and care better. Let's remember, pharmacists have been obsolete for years and somehow stick around.</div>
