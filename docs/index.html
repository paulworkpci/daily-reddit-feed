I would highly recommend therapy. Social anxiety is a form of negative feedback loop. You will need to challenge it in controlled settings to overcome it.

Analogy: Think of it like a muscle. You're trying to lift heavy with weak muscles. Instead you need to start with gentle exercises to build it up and slowly work your way up.

Best of luck!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Well one is know that anxiety is normal. It's when it's a disorder it's a problem. I say this because you will never get rid of anxiety. That would be like saying if only I could get rid of the need to breathe then I wouldn't have to breathe.  

I still have anxiety, but I would say I cured the debilitating not being able to socialize aspect of it.

1. Lots of things can help you. My therapist called it a mental health toolbox. You need to add tools to your toolbox for different situations. Since you're in this sub I assume meditation is one. I recommend looking up " things that stimulate the Vagus nerve" Anything listed there can help. Find one that works for you. The more you stimulate your vagus nerve the more you can train your body to go back to normal and not be in fight or flight all the time.

2. Anxiety is fear of the future. Work on changing how you think about this. I did it by following videos "how to process emotions." Off YouTube. Not acknowledging feelings causes a lot of problems. Feeling are a function like anything else in your body. Millions of years of evolution are telling you what makes you happy, sad, and worried. If you ignore feelings you're not letting your body work as intended. Like holding your breath until you pass out. 

One thing I wish was more common knowledge was that once you feel your feelings they go away! Once you acknowledge your anxiety, willingly, for the most part it goes away. It will still be there of course because it's a function like oxygen going to the lungs, but for me it stopped being something ruining my life.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I got over it completely without medication (or meditation). 
It took me years. But I did it in the healthiest way, with the most long lasting and best results. 

Basically. Exposure therapy was what solved it. Constantly pushing myself in social situations. Interacting with strangers as much as possible. 
And when something eventually got easier, I started pushing myself to do something even harder. If just thinking about doing something made me nervous or anxious, like dancing or singing in front of people, I knew that it was something to work towards. And every time I pushed myself to do something like that, I ended up more confident, and less anxious. 

Also. When doing something hard. Don’t do it just once. Continue to do it. First time is absolutely the hardest. But it quickly gets easier, and the following times is what creates permanent (positive) change in the brain.</div>

The history of MS and their quantum achievements is remarkable mostly in how many times they've lied about their current or upcoming capabilities.  I saw the headline and said neat then remembered literally every other announcement from MS in this field and say well maybe next time.

[Nature even had to publish an editorial about the Majorana thing](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-024-08445-2/MediaObjects/41586_2024_8445_MOESM2_ESM.pdf), making it clear that they don't actually have any evidence at all that Majorana zero nodes were observed, rather that they maybe *could be*.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Yesterday, they wrote a document about rate limits:  [Cursor – Rate Limits](https://docs.cursor.com/account/rate-limits)

From the article, it's evident that their so-called rate limits are measured based on 'underlying compute usage' and reset every few hours. They define two types of limits:

1. Burst rate limits
2. Local rate limits

He would wear these ratty old shirts all the time so every birthday, Christmas, fathers day, etc I would buy him at least one new shirt. Nothing too fancy, just one the same as his favourites except not falling apart.  He would always say he was saving them for good and I would explain that they were everyday shirts.

But I’m way more interested in how they handle code review.


Can they catch subtle logic bugs?

Do they understand context across files?

Can they suggest meaningful improvements, not just “rename this variable” stuff?


has anyone actually integrated ai into their review workflow, maybe via pull request comments, CLI tools, or even standalone review assistants?
If so, what’s (ai tools) worke...</div>

For example just saying "review my codebase to look for improvements that can be made"

Or

Posting a guide on Clean Architecture and SOLID as context then asking it to review the codebase.

Proper context is king.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Building this feature to turn chat into a diagram. Do you think this will be useful?

The example shown is fairly simple task:  
1. gets the API key from .env.local  
2. create an api route on server side to call the actual API  
3. return the value and render it in a front end component

But this would work for more complicated tasks as well. 

I know when vibe coding, I rarely read the chat, but maybe having a diagram will help with understanding what the AI is doing? </div>

VS code is part of my whole work flow and there are a number of extensions I rely on. I don't care how cool your tool is, if it doesn't fit in VS Code, I'll probably never use it.</div>

The diagram is only good at explaining and visualizing the high level flow though. So if you are already reviewing code by hand (which is a much more detailed level of understanding) - I dont think this will replace that.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">For what it's worth, it is actually banned in a lot of the first world fisheries. Of course, that's a small percentage of the ocean.

Even if/when it is banned, one of the biggest problems is enforcement- lots of countries (re:China) have fleets that go all over and fish with total disregard for legality. It's extremely hard for anyone to enforce their EEZ as the ocean is just so vast, especially for poorer nations.

IMO one of the best ways ive seen is to actually recruit local fisherman to help enforce the laws (since there are few government vessels) by spotting and reporting illegal fishing, since they naturally competing with these other operations.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It did feel imminent.   When some autonomous driving was possible, you kind feel like “it won’t take long for them to handle the long tail scenarios, for full self driving”.     
    
But I feel like weather forecasting is a good example of how flawed that “feeling” is.    
20-30 years ago, we had pretty accurate forecasts for 2-3 days.     It’s taken decades to get accuracy to 4-6 days.   But to double that outcome, it’s taken over a MILLION times more processing power!   Autonomous driving might not take that much more processing power, but the complexity it needs to handle to go from basic adaptive cruise control, to handling every possible situation is certainly that kind of exponential difference.</div>

Now put it in terms of electrical energy.  30 years / 18 months (moore's law period) is 20. 2^20 is a million.

It sounds like to double that outcome, it's taken single digit times more energy expenditure.</div>
