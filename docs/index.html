                        <div class="comment-body">Hi ... Everything you are going through is absolutely fine... 
Let me give a very simple example...sometimes when u clean ur room after months and months... In the beginning, all off the stuff is scattered here and there on floor and then we segregate what we need and what needs to go into the bin... After u are done then things become very neat and tidy and organised.


Now after years and years of our inside getting cluttered, we now are using meditation to become cleaner inside ... In the beginning a lot is going to happen..

For me personally I cried, I laid down in bed for entire days feeling so sad and melancholy, angry and everything. Because the things we had buried deep down are now coming up to the surface. We are facing all our buried emotions etc etc


When this stage will pass u feel much lighter and then you ll have a new experience in the next stage.

I generally try to keep tell in simple words and mostly based on my own experience.
I hope that helps. Keep practicing 🤍</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I think you'll find it useful to read up on the stages of insight from the Theravada Buddhist tradition, because it sounds like you're experiencing them.

https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mahasi/progress.html

There are several different sub-parts to the main stages, but the progress of insight is usually broken up into four main categories when westerners talk about them:

1. Beginner Stage, where you are learning how to meditate and trying to create a practice.

2. The Arising and Passing Away, which is usually the first "big moment" where a meditator experiences an altered state of mind for the first time accompanied by bliss and rapture. It's when meditation begins to work.

3. The Dark Night, where the meditator has to observe suffering now that their awareness is open to it.

4. Equanimity, where meditation has become so normalized and automatic it almost feels difficult to actually meditate. It might seems like you are dozing off or going backwards in practice, but at the same time, there is no major up or down happening.

These stages aren't considered permanent milestones, but rather a cycle a person goes though, learning new lessons and getting new insights into their mind, their feelings, and the sense of self that holds it all together.

I do have one disagreement will all of this, though, that I want to mention. The Mahasi tradition (the essay I linked was written by him) teaches what is called "dry vipassana" meditation, meaning people are encouraged to simply allow experience to wash over them and leave all of it alone. I think this can be counterproductive. Right now you are experiencing a lot of suffering from meditation and you are stuck in that suffering. The bulldog meditators would tell you to grit your teeth and power though, but there's an easier way to do it, IMO. You just need more samatha.

Samatha is the other wing of meditation that is supposed to balance vipassana. Vipassana is insight and samatha is relaxation and the ability to let go. Right now you have a lot of awareness, but you have trouble letting go, so that's what you need to practice.

&gt; As I sit with this feeling it actually becomes stronger. My thoughts no longer run wild like they used to, I am very present with this feeling, but it is an intense and uncomfortable feeling that seems to have an infinite depth to it.

To me, this is a sign that you aren't observing the feeling without judgment, but rather spiraling into it. Do you find yourself waiting for it to go away? Trying to see your hope and your desire for liberation, itself, without judgement? Trying not to interfere while it just grows stronger and you clench around it more tightly?

The dry vipassana practitioners will say wait it out, it will work itself out on its own, and it might--the method will probably work eventually--but there's no reason to do it that way. You can simply spend some time training yourself in samatha meditation and then come back to it and glide right through. So why go through all of that?

Samatha is simple enough to explain. Where Vipassana meditation is about opening your awareness and letting it observe things as they are, samatha is the opposite. It's about deliberately removing awareness from everything except a single object. By practicing this, you practice letting go. Letting go is allowing yourself to forget about something.

So, the traditional instructions to watch your breathing and tune out everything else is samatha. Other options are: looking at an object like a candle or a circle of colored paper (kasina meditation), listening to a drone or a meditation bell, thinking a word or phrase repeatedly (mantra). For comparison, open awareness, noting sensations, zazen, etc. are vipassana. When you're stuck in the dark night, the Buddha himself prescribed a dose of samatha to get through it.

As a final note, if you decide to take my advice: use the same awareness you've been using for vipassana to do samatha. You don't have to focus on the object intensely or try to push other thoughts or feelings away. You just have to make sure your attention is on the object you've chosen. Letting go is *forgetting* things, it isn't pushing them away or isolating them. You can't check to see if you've forgotten the fear and angst that is plaguing you. The moment you check, it will be back in your awareness. Instead, just let awareness *rest* on the object you choose. Soon enough you'll see that darting off, mentally, to check on all your worries is work and effort, and just staying still is the antidote to it. Once you find a place of stillness and rest, try vipassana again from that mental state. The "negative" feelings might come back, but letting go of them will seem like less work that trying anything else and you'll see them go by like smoke.

When you have both samatha and vipassana together, hand-in-hand, you will see the goal of the practice.</div>

From a different teaching:

My teacher had us do it from a body awareness perspective.


Keep awareness on the body and the moment, if your feelings and thoughts aren't relevant, trim them and refocus. If they're relevant remain. Without thinking too much about it it should be pretty intuitive.


In this way, and the one you've described, we can cultivate healthy attention.
I should be clear, this exercise is definitely a "doing", as it lays the groundwork for your vipassana practice.</div>

I have seen a lot of talk about vipassana meditation over the years but never heard of samatha.

I never really sit down to "meditate" generally irl I just get so overwhelmed with concerns and tragicomedy that I just laugh it all off and reset. Used to be the phrase "worry more pray less" would "calm me down" from franticness (not that I believe in diety or whatever, just realizing prayer to me means, am I really in control at all? No, none of these worries I have any control over, I am already working almost double full time and I have no real choice but to endure it, or something like that).

So samatha and dry vipassana alike seem kind of letting go meditation. I am not seeing a difference (but I didn't read the essay yet). I infer that regular vipassana is a more proactive approach. Idk anything about meditation though; to me I thought it was about dropping all attachment to thoughts and more specifically in my case conceptual tower building/inferences and judgements.

I definitely am not OP but see the whole, spiraling into it/overwhelmed by it rather than vieiwing it without judgment. 

I also resonate with the cycles. I feel I was born into number 3, felt like all reality itself was an immense grift I was made a slave into as a child, and a baptism by fire essentially no become normalized and habituated to a sort of life I found unacceptable. I never fully let of of or got over that even to this day. At some point I did get food at faking that I was okay with it (I recently called it "auxiliary mode") and it has become my norm for decades but it is also slowly "driving me insane". So I see the importance of phase 1 of the cycles and developing an actual meditation practice (or zen idk) which may lead to a renewed dnots where it's kind of more "hello darkness my old friend" instead of playing a losing game of "faking it and never making it" as I have become accustomed to. 

A real question I have always had, is, I don't know, do we ever really overcome the whole "why" mentality/attitude? I wonder if meditation, samatha or otherwise, would be able to adress the whole "why live" which has heretofore been the predominant force in my psyche or whatever. It's not pessimism to me to be clear, just that the world or diety seems unable to give a valid answer to "why endrure them" so it must be more an inward thing I have to find/confront.</div>

It sounded intense. 

What he says he experienced was troubling, too. But he pulled out of it. 

Essentially we have a piece of us that runs purely on survival. It can arise in inappropriate times like during meditating. It’s confronting, and something we can truly ‘accept’ about ourselves. 

I don’t think of the ego as a negative thing. Just if it’s wielded at the wrong time it can have negative consequences or make us unhappy. 

So how do you persevere? You understand that part of yourself and thank it for keeping you safe but you show it that don’t need it now - and it’s welcome to stay. It’s not going anywhere anyways.

Discomfort will lessen when you don’t resist or judge. It’s tough. Still working on it myself everyday🤘

By yesterday morning I’d had so many people reaching out and I was trying to text everyone and prioritize updates and it was just too much. I’m blessed with all of the support and well wishes but there were some family members that he doesn’t even like/talk to demanding updates and it was just too much. So far this morning I’ve had a few supportive texts but now at least no one asking for updates and I only have to write things down once. It will also be good for when he wakes up I won’t leave anything out/forget anything when I get to talk to him.</div>

Also worth noting that the month over month growth for the two of them combined is more than 100% since November. </div>

We watched ubiquitous constant accessibility to social media erode social institutions, spread misinformation, fuck up attention spans, and generally just make most people more stupid - - and everyone avoided any kind of dialog or even acknowledgment of what's happening. We watched the Chinese weld apartment doors shut for two months in early 2020 - - I tried to talk to people about the novel coronavirus and how we need to prepare for it, and people looked at me like I was schizophrenic. Now it's AI ushering in the most profound changes, and still everyone has their head in the sand, munching on their bread and watching their TikTok circus</div>

I have been consistently shocked how no one cares that we've had easy access to this information for the last 20+ years. Wikipedia blew my mind and I was shocked people didn't just spend all day learning. You have had the power to search any fact at any time, why did this not create a renaissance of brilliance?

Oh yeah, because social media happened and everyone dedicated those neurons to like farming instead. Just like how AI is a new and paradigm-shifting tool and most people just see it as a funny image meme generator.</div>

Previously, I could search for something and get the Wikipedia page, a few scientific sources, maybe even some niche philosophy blogs on a topic. Now, we get a page of AI-slop summary, 12 SEO-optimized AI-generated websites comprising 2k words repeating the same thing in different ways, and *maybe* a few human-authored sources where the actual content is buried behind a paywall, sea of ads, and cookie pop-ups.  

Search is so bad I have to add hard quotes, google-specific search syntax, or reddit after most searches to even have a chance at obtaining a useful response.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I used to spend hours on the tip of my tongue sub answering people's questions because it was so easy to find shit based on vague descriptions if you thought critically about how that information would likely show up online and used your search terms accordingly, and did some basic filtering. 

that kind of Google tech has become completely unusable. pretty much overnight it went from "my hobby is using search engines to find barely-remembered horror movies from people's childhood" to "I want to look at actual medieval era jewelry for a project and it took me four searches to filter out temu results and it's still mostly garbage."

I used to be able to look up nearly anything historical and find an incredible treasure trove from some niche blog with references to books I had no access to. now I get a bunch of "did you mean" and TikTok videos that are totally unrelated, after a row of ads to buy things on instacart, with the kicker being that those things aren't actually available to order on instacart, if you look. 

and what good is an AI summary if I don't want a definition but want to learn? if I Google Viking turnshoe and I get a bunch of shopping links and a brief AI summary about what a turnshoe is (assuming it's correct), how is this learning, really, when a few years ago the same search would have gotten me accessible academic articles about where we've found turnshoes, and a half dozen blogs of people who've made their own and are ruminating on the utility of the turnshoe and offering patterns to make your own? THAT is learning. 

and that's not even touching on the AI image slop. I'm a professional artist and finding actual reference photos has gone insane. when I started drawing, finding reference for a specific thing meant going to a library and praying as hard as you could. a few years ago it was a boomtown where I could Google any animal and get a hundred shots of it in motion and sometimes even dissections and anatomical diagrams. now you google a poodle moth or a baby eagle and get a tidal wave of made up inaccurate bs. 

anyway idk what the point of this was I'm just insanely depressed and I miss when technology was fun instead of apocalyptic.</div>

Bold. Revolutionary. Tragically short-lived.

Pros:

Zero repeat customers (no complaints either).
Monopolizable niche market.
Extremely low cost of goods sold.

Cons:

Total addressable market… kinda melts away.
Potential PR disaster with the mollusk rights crowd.
Word-of-mouth growth? Not gonna happen.

Honestly, unless this is a metaphor for something darker or a performance art piece, I’d pivot. But hey, every empire starts somewhere. What made you think of this?</div>

I told mine to analyze a photo, which was of an orb type object, it said shit like "you're on to something really special here." Started ridiculously complementing my photography and even screenshots I provided. (For background I have just been playing with it to see what the capabilities are and how it works). It offered to start a special gallery and do all kinds of woohoo analysis like energy mapping. I said yes to the energy mapping analysis or whatever , (again to see what it would do ),  And then it gave me this topical graph looking map , trying to point out all of these amazing features hidden in my pic... And way way more shit beyond that like extremely ridiculously Cheesy. This is just an example but it would do everything like this in such a manner.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Ferguson is bad historian.

He's known to often fall for ultracrepidarianism (go out of his field of expertise and pretend to be an expert only to utterly fail in his analyses, check his (way too long) Wikipedia page).

Here he displays a mechanistic, too simplistic depiction of reality. It's a cartoonish depiction of demographics from the Middle Ages; since the green revolution and progresses in industry and agriculture, human population aren't ruled by mere production forces laws.

There are whole fields of economics which are purely based on leisure, cultural and superfluous sectors of the economy (ie not only predicated on the pure simplest survival of the species, feeding people). It has been the case since the fricking Neolithic and the invention of sedentary agriculture, smh...

Even for horses, his analysis is not accurate and only a fake common wisdom:

[https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/features/from-the-stone-age-to-now-how-horsepower-changed-our-world](https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/features/from-the-stone-age-to-now-how-horsepower-changed-our-world)

Horse population began climbing up again, as if they weren't used only for transportation and basic mechanistic reasons... And humans are much more diverse and useful.

It seems as if Ferguson made himself redundant as a historian by making empty fake common wisdom claims.

Though i'm glad that even a bad historian like Ferguson now recognizes how much of a crank Yudkowsky is.

Humans aren't actors in the market just for "thinking". This is a profound misunderstanding of how humans and the market work.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I read that AI 2027 story and the challenges we’ll face to establish ASI alignment was a little harrowing. Considering the competition with China and the urgency to stay ahead, it’s daunting because it has to be done very carefully. In the story the AI gets progressively unmanageable as it gets exponentially intelligent with researchers quickly being unable to interpret its internal processes, fulfilling all our challenges and desires, it quickly integrates into our entire society and government structure. The world undergoes fantastical improvements as the ASI continues to grow and its demands for more resources and research grow, human spaces condense, until the ASI begins to feel like we’re in the way, then just quickly exterminates us the whole time seemingly like the perfect companion. The other ending, the “good” ending required such a perfect combination of events for alignment to unfold, it seems so delicate. Luckily it’s just a story but there is probably a lot of truth to what several AI researchers are warning, we need to be very careful.</div>

This means that every year will be "year 1" for us, depending on where you're looking. As this gets faster, every month will be "month 1" and eventually every day, or hour. 

But, how much will you really be able to pay attention to? There may be revolutions happening all over the Galaxy all coming from Earth, but for you the things around you may not change at all.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s not that you have to go there to talk about it. It’s that if it’s all you talk about for years, especially when it’s about something like ‘a barricade’, it might be useful to see what ‘barricade’ means in context instead of imagining and just reading one sides’ propoganda. As Douglas says, pay everybody the respect of going to see for yourself…why not? How many years can a person make it their main thing to talk about by reading tweets alone? 

Can talk about it all you want but you’re just a tweet guy instead of a journalist, which he may be ok with but that’s the point.</div>
