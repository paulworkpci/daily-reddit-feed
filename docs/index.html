                                <div class="reply-body">Ah, I do let myself use a computer, but because it's just like.. less convenient, it means I am doing some action that makes me do at least *something*. In practice, just getting out of bed and starting to do other things has made me not "cheat" by getting on a computer.. From the beginning, my goal in this was to force myself out of my bed and onto other things. So that is, for instance, how I'm on reddit right now... but I only ended up on here because I got a work call and had to get on. Before that I was reading a book on my kindle in a book store for the first time in something like 6 months.

This might sound strange as someone who has spend so many hours on a phone, but I honestly don't think I was addicted to my phone. It was more a tool I could use to be completely escapist and not have to but up agianst my depression. I think about how people mention "enablers" in addicts lives. Eg: the Parent that keeps feeding and giving money to their addict son. To me, my smart phone was like that and the thing that it was enabling me to do was not fight my depression. So for me, even having to do something on a computer feels like a win. \^\^;

As for how long I might switch to a dumb phone.. I'm actually still trying to figure that one out. As for right now, I've decided that I will do this for at least a month. That was sort of the original plan.. but the farther into this thing I go the more I think I will just not go back to smart phones at all. I'm not sure that I have enough will power to not fall back into a life where I just lay around all the time to avoid pain.. and because I am over IT at my company, I might have the luxury of being able to use hardware tokens for MFA. I think if I do end up with a smart phone again, I'll have to use a rooted phone that I've set up specifically so that I cannot bypass any security settings. I think I need to at least have a limit on how long I can use specific apps that I can't bypass.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Honestly, I wouldn't have gone full dumb phone if I hadn't just managed to bypass the popular blocking apps in my past efforts to do without a smart phone. For most people I think just using an app is going to be easier, more flexible, and just more compatible with today. \^\^; That said though, if you do end up wanting to go with a dumb phone, I'd just ask if you've checked with the institutions you are worried about to see if there are other options for verifications.. Because a lot of people (ie: grandparents) don't traditionally use technology much, a lot of institutions allow you to get through with other things like hardware tokens. (RSA tokens, Fido2, U2F, etc..). You might find that institutions you are worried about allow you to use these option or that you can use a competing institution that does offer this option.</div>

Edit: I had to share this Chatgpt prompt:


"Dude, have you actually looked into X-COM? Like, have you really dug into what these guys are doing? It’s insane! They’re literally a bunch of rogue, unaccountable psychopaths running around, abducting people, brainwashing soldiers, and waging this guerrilla war that, honestly, most people don’t even want!

Look, I get it. The whole 'aliens took over, and now we have to resist' thing sounds romantic, like some 1984-style, fight-the-system kinda deal. But have you actually been to an Advent city? They’ve got clean streets, no crime, healthcare that actually works—like, dude, they have genetic upgrades for regular people! And these X-COM dudes? They’re out there blowing up infrastructure, raiding medical facilities, killing Advent officers—who, by the way, are just trying to keep the peace!

And let’s talk about the aliens, man. I know, I know, 'Oh, they’re overlords, they’re manipulating humanity.' But what were we doing before they showed up? We were destroying ourselves! War, pollution, disease, all of it. The Elders come in, and suddenly, boom! Humanity gets a chance to actually evolve. These guys have been around for who knows how long, they’ve mastered genetics, they’ve got tech we can’t even comprehend, and X-COM’s response? 'Nah, let’s blow up a gene clinic because we don’t like the idea of progress.'

Dude, these guys are just terrorists with a nostalgia problem. They want to drag us back to the dark ages because they can’t accept that maybe—just maybe—the aliens are better at running things than we ever were. You don’t have to like everything the Elders do, but you gotta admit, Advent has done more for humanity than any Earth government ever did.

And don’t even get me started on the psionics, man. Like, have you seen what these guys can do? There’s some next-level consciousness-expansion stuff happening, and X-COM wants to shut it all down. I bet if they just sat down with one of the Elders and did some DMT, they’d realize we’re all part of some cosmic intelligence, and they’d stop acting like paranoid lunatics.

I’m telling you, X-COM is fighting the wrong war. They’re clinging to this outdated idea of 'humanity first' when, in reality, the future is hybrid, man. The future is evolution. And if you can’t see that, you’re just stuck in the past."</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">this graph actually quite severely understates the gains because o3 full uses gpt-4o as its base model this is confirmed by OpenAI and it already gets 87.7 on GPQA so if you apply that same insanely busted reasoning framework OpenAI has for o3 to a much much better base model being GPT-4.5 it will be absolutely insane to the point of GPQA no longer being useful as a benchmark since it would be entirely saturated in the high 90s I think a fundamental blunder in OpenAIs marketing was not explicitly outright in front of peoples face telling everyone o1 and o3 are based on gpt-4o that way we would be more impressed by the gains reasoning has but instead we have to dig deep to find such information</div>

And once they unify their models 4.5 will probably also vanish. So I really don’t get what the big fucking deal is anyway. As if Sam is forcing you to spend tokens on 4.5.

Like this sub gets angry if they only talk about intermediate models and don’t release them, and this sub also gets angry if they do release them. Can’t win.</div>

If you get the most enjoyment out of a game by setting things to easy, cheating, using guides, or whatever, then do it.  

  
If you get the most enjoyment out of a game by challenging and testing your limits do it.

  
If you're somewhere in between or it changes based on your mood, that's fine too.

We tend to think motion in robots will be easy to do, because it comes so very easily to us. Without realizing that human dexterity is practically a human superpower that few other species can match.

It’s inevitable at this point that robots with ai will replace humans. It’s already happening; bmw has similar robots in their factories as does Tesla. We’re in the early adopter stage and this will speed up every year as adoption grows, price comes down, and the tech matures. But it’s already there, and not enough people are freaked out about the future. It should be in everyone’s top 3 voting priorities</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm shocked that people are acting like Bret's claim about the actuators being capable of 5x normal speed is news. I would have thought this was already common knowledge among the r/singularity community. Are people really just now realizing that the software is the bottleneck, not the hardware? With 3.6 million members, I expected a more informed discussion, not a collective 'aha' moment over something that seems like it should have been obvious.

At the moment the systems running at less than 10fps,  unplayable.

We see what Unitree can do, so the bodies of humanoid robots can absolutely move at those speeds. If they were to succeed in what they say at speeding up their software, and that software were to be at a Unitree body, then this would happen exactly as stated. 

Which makes me think that he is not lying, I see no reason to believe that their hardware is so far behind that it is not possible.</div>

                <div class="post-content">It can be your phone, your console, whatever it is that you want to avoid, at least put it 30 seconds away from you.

Small frictions can and do go a long way because most of the time you're not aware and just go for that thing blindly.

30 seconds can trigger a sort of alarm in your head and grant you control, even momentarily "Wait a second, what am I doing right now".

You can do this by putting it in a different place or by adding layers of inconvenience between the craving and the reward.

btw, the only time nato article five was invoked was to protect and avenge the united states after 9/11. so basically the u.s. is being a complete ass to its allies.</div>

The whole "world police" think is blatant propaganda. We don't act in other countries because we're concerned for their well-being. We do it because it's in our interests, and makes us wealthy.</div>

Most people here in this sub are all kind of a niche group of people who are interested in AI in general despite how we view things differently. We are NOT the general population. We debate whether a certain LLM is better. We shit on each other when we do not agree with their view points. In short, we are a bunch of people who pay attention to the AI progress maybe more than we should.

                        <div class="comment-body">The sesame voice AI is absolutely nuts. I knew it was AI. I knew it wasn't really a person on the other end, and yet, I couldn't help but *feel* like I was talking to a person. I got the same social anxiety I get when talking to a person. I felt awkward when I couldn't answer a question quickly. I felt awkward when I misspoke. It was an absolutely unreal experience for me. 

I'm not sure these human feelings can be overcome. I remember watching Star Trek as a kid and the scenes in the holodeck and thinking that the way the characters were reacting was stupid because the holodeck images were just that - images. I remember thinking I would never be stupid enough to be tricked by a holodeck. But maybe it's not that simple. Or maybe it is, maybe it's something you can train your brain to handle, like getting your sea legs. I don't know. All I know is that this is an important threshold.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">So easy for old methods. It can easily be fixed with augmented training data and is rather trivial if done that way.

Pokemon was great exactly because Antrophic probably did not supply any fine tuning for it - those are then real generalizing capabilities.

If it actually turned into a benchmark, you'd see some corporate labs jump on reporting great strides in scores, but it can be achieved in ways that are rather shallow and just for show.

So if they can make clear that they are not fine tuning for pokemon or path finding, that is exciting. Or, a benchmark probably need a more varied set of such challenges.</div>

So, I'm curious whether you feel that you, when you are not using AI, you became smarter and more creative or less smart and less creative?

This question is not about whether you became smarter with the use of AI, but whether you became smarter when you don't have access to it anymore.

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm a graphic designer / lecturer and video games artist and I avoid it mostly. I chat to ChatGPT about twice a week but mostly for silly or non-design curious stuff.

I'm learning Javascript and did not find ChatGPT useful because mostly, I'd just use it to get the answer and decided that that was not learning, then when I tried to use it structurally (i.e. "tell me if this is possible to do this way... ...without code examples", or other such methods to find out concepts and methods gradually), I figured out that just taking a bit more time and looking at the Mozilla docs made me retain the info better, and feel more confident I was on the right track for me. Using the latter process now feels far more satisfying.

I generally think, 'what's the point in outsourcing my understanding of something' and I've also now developed a distrust with LLMs giving bad info, or setting me up with correct info but not in a direction that suits my context.

My general impression is that it makes me lazy, and I much prefer human interactions, or well written, consistent documentation. I'm happier without it, and not using it avoids the anxiety I get around the energy usage for training those models etc.  -  I mean, that stuff is still gonna happen without me of course.</div>

He can't help but to say the quiet part out loud or know how to politicly spin shit. He could have easily just had said, in this video, that the corruption is so bad that "corrupt" people will kill him. But no, instead he suggests that the everyday man will be mad at him for dismantling our education system. Which begs me to wonder what HE thinks corruption is? In his mind, is "corruption" a dog whistle for democracy?</div>

I just saw this post on twitter from earlier tonight! The president is in Florida right now and some of the military aircraft flying in the area are experiencing “Orbs” flying around them and messing with their electronics in the aircraft! The guy who posted this on twitter said “This is a first for me in 40 years of monitoring”. Something strange is definitely going on tonight!! …………………………………………………………………………….

Danny Sheehan says that David Grusch and Lue Elizondo told the house oversight committee a UFO reverse engineering program is trying to make a delivery system for nuclear weapons that can strike Russia or China in 2 minutes and he knows the company that’s doing it   
  
“Now they didn't, they didn't testify in public about the latter part of it, but I knew about it. And so I was telling everybody about this you know, I, I had never taken any security oath and Lue had not conveyed that to me, you know, under attorney-client privilege or anything. But I had, because of my representing Lou and knowing all of these other people, I was able to talk to other sources who gave that information to us. And I even knew the, the aerospace company that was working on it.”

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean, it honestly makes sense. I hate it, but it makes sense. 

  
If there was a way to deliver a nuclear bomb in 2 minutes, it renders all other nuclear deterrents ineffective. With technology like this, there's always a fear that if you are not the first to weaponize it, someone else will be. Imagine if Russia had their hands on a nuclear bomb delivery system that could strike anywhere in the world in less than 2 minutes. It means that at any point they could completely obliterate their enemy without retaliation. Right now a big deterrent in launching nuclear weapons is that the enemy has enough time to respond and retaliate before the bombs hit. This would make that not the case. ICBMs are currently similar in that they are pretty much impossible to defend against in a meaningful way, but the ability to retaliate is a massive deterrent. 2 minute window from launch to detonation would mean no time to retaliate at all. 

  
I get your point, but releasing this tech that is CLEARLY capable of being weaponized in such a profound way, without first having a defense against that weapon, is scary. It's the state of the world in general, and until we find peace globally, this will always be the case because it kind of needs to be. We can't really fault these companies for weaponizing the tech in its infancy given the state of the world. I hate it, but I don't see any other option.

  
Imagine if we invented teleportation tomorrow. would we release it to the public before having a way to prevent someone from teleporting a nuclear weapon into the Whitehouse? First step to defending against that would be to first discover how to do it. 

  
Technology will make the destruction of our planet more and more accessible, even if the technology itself is something that can also be used to great benefit. Nuclear power is a great example of this. You can't have nuclear fusion reactors without having nuclear fusion bombs. It's guaranteed that the warlike mentality of humanity is holding us back.

"Perhaps the biggest limitation in our study is that we cannot reliably detect language that was generated by LLMs,
but was either heavily edited by humans or was generated by models that imitate very well human writing"


And yes, I get how hilarious it is that the last sentence reads so awkwardly.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">When AI detectors first came out this was pretty much how they worked but now the more """sophisticated""" ones (notice the many quotes since even the best ones are still trash) are looking more for typical AI speech patterns which are actually still easily noticeable if you aren't careful with how you use AI. if you are careful, and you make a good prompt and tell the AI how to write exactly like you want it will, but many people don't do this and just ask the AI bluntly hey write xyz for me these are the people who can be caught easily I'm sure you've seen it before yourself text that seems like it was clearly written by AI and if a human can notice it AI detectors definitely can too. So TL;DR AI is perfectly capable of writing in such a way to sound human and avoid detection but the human users of said AI are usually too lazy to use it correctly.</div>

Norwegian Defense Minister Tore Sandvik announced very early this Sunday morning that Haltbakk Bunkers rogue actions were not in line with the policy of the Norwegian government and all requested fuel has now been provided to the sub.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Nuclear power submarines only need to be refueled every couple of decades.

The USS Virginia was commissioned in 2004, should have another decade before needing fuel

This seems like optics/politics.</div>
