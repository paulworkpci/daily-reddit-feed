[**Dyad**](http://dyad.sh/) is a free, local, open-source alternative to v0/Lovable/Bolt, but without the lock-in or limitations. All the code runs on your computer and you can use any model you want (including Gemini 2.5 Flash which has a generous free tier)!

One big benefit with dyad is that you can use it seamlessly with Cursor/VS Code/etc since all the code is on your computer. The one thing a lot of people asked for was to import existing projects, and now with this wee...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm a hobbyist using AI the last ~6 weeks or so and found Gemini Code Assist to be the best (for free). 

I've tried the Cursor Pro Trial and experienced too many bugs and hallucinations using both Sonnet 3.5 and Gemini 2.5. Exhausted my 150 fast requests and gave up.

VS Code + Cline has limitations with API tokens when using it for free and 1m tokens/day for Gemini 2.5 is really barely anything. Also has constant issues with diff edit mismatching.

Gemini Code Assist does enough and while it does hallucinate sometimes, being able to @ files/directories for context is good enough for me. Can't paste/upload images or files but you can get around it by putting it in your VS Code workspace then referencing it with @.

I've done several small webscraping scripts (JS/Python) with only VS Code + Gemini Code Assist and no other extensions/tools.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Just for clarification there are about 4.5 million white people in SA. There is also a crime pandemic that affects all races. Yes farm attacks happen But they are not government policy nor do they have anything to do with the government. They exist within a greater crime epidemic. The people dying at the highest rates, by an order of magnitude are young black women, who are often raped and Tortured,  and young black men. I am a white South African living in Durban SA. There is no white genocide in SA. Period.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hunter S. Thompson had some thoughts on this. 

"This is no minor issue, no boil on the national flesh that will disappear with time and herbal medicine. The South African problem will not go away anytime soon. Those people are riding the tiger down there, and it is one of those rides that does not have the look of longevity. The whole nation will be gone, like Rhodesia, by 1988. And after that we will have those people on our hands, two or three generations of crazed Afrikaners who got chased off the continent by native black people. They will arrive by the tens of thousands at airports like Miami, Atlanta and Dallas, with letters of passage and crates full of burp guns and Krugerrands. Some will push north to Montana and Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, to hook up with the Aryan Nation and other white-supremacist cults. By the turn of the century — if Reagan has his way — expatriate Afrikaners will control huge sections of the American West, from the Black Hills all the way to the ocean."</div>

* GPT can do work
* Codex is based on GPT
* Codex refuses to do complex work, it is somehow instructed to do the minimum possible work, or under minimum.

The entire Codex thing is some cheap propaganda, a local LLM may do more work than the lazy codex :-(</div>

They're seemingly grasping at straws, now that data shows programmers make the majority of paying customers of LLM services. Both Anthropic and now Google are eating their lunch.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I’ll be interested to see how much demand there actually is for these things.  On the one hand, Kei trucks make a hell of a lot of sense from a practicality standpoint.  On the other hand, it’s Texas and it might be difficult to sell a teeny tiny pickup with ~50hp to a bunch of people who fawn over their brodozer like it’s Jesus Christ and worship its manufacturer like it was God the Father. On the third hand, I’m sure a healthy industry will emerge for modifying the hell out of Kei trucks with lift kits, mud tires, and engine swaps.  
My cautious guess would be that there will be a big initial spike followed by a huge drop after the novelty wears off, finalizing with a return to a sensible price point that’s slightly or moderately higher than now due to the added value of them being street legal.</div>

What’s the argument for spending $500K now?  
  
(Steal my prompt below 👇🏼)

This was made entirely in Veo 3 (text to video). I can't believe that making an ad is this easy. Shooting something like this would have taken me and 50 crew members over 2 months from script to final edit. Here's my prompt for the opening shot 👇🏼

                                <div class="reply-body">To me the issue is that those real people who would set up and do the shoot, the actors, the set providers - none of them get paid anymore. It's all being outsourced to a chatbot who can generate video clips.

Those $500k OP mentioned? Would have gone into the pockets of real people, who would have gone further to sustain the economy by buying food n stuff. Now OP charges client the same amount, pays only $500 and pockets the rest (which is likely significantly higher than $500k).

Nice, what can I say. Future's bright.</div>

Except I have a freaking certification in teaching meditation. I hold a 500 hour yoga teaching certification. I STILL have so many issues putting down the phone because of adhd.

It doesn't matter where others are in their practice, this is just where you are. No worries. At first it's like lifting a great weight. But you will get stronger...like water erodes the largest of rocks, if you keep at it over the years you will develop the wisdom that moves mountains. One breath at a time. 😊</div>

**Videos &amp; Sounds:** Generated with Veo 3

**Prompt style:**

* A close-up handheld shot of an elderly Black man sitting on a worn-out porch, lit by overcast daylight. He wears a faded cloth mask under his chin, a knit beanie pulled low, and his eyes are tired but sharp. He looks directly into the camera, slowly shakes his head, and says in a dry, gravelly African American accent, “Really? Of all the years you could have put me in with a single prompt, you chose 2020?” He leans back slightly, letting the silence settle. The background is quiet — no cars, no birds, just a faint breeze and the distant sound of someone coughing. A slow, somber blues guitar riff plays under the moment, rough and minimal, as the man stares at the lens like he’s seen too much already. No cuts. Just one long, steady look.
*  A single handheld shot begins close on a revolutionary leader in his 50s, standing on a small, weathered wooden platform surrounded by a furious crowd. He grips a rusted metal podium with both hands, coat whipping in the wind, eyes burning with rage. The camera shakes slightly as it follows him tightly from the side, then swings around to the front as he shouts at the top of his lungs: “None of us is real! We’re here because someone decided to write a prompt! We all hate him for it!” His voice is raw, cracking from fury and strain. All around him, people are shouting, reaching, pressing toward the stage — faces twisted with anger, fists raised, flags snapping in the wind. The camera stays close to the leader the entire time, bobbing slightly with each movement, capturing the sweat on his face, the spit flying from his mouth, the chaos behind him growing louder. A heavy, aggressive orchestral score pulses beneath it — pounding drums and dissonant brass rising as the crowd roars like a storm closing in. The shot never breaks — one continuous, breathless view of a man shouting into madness.
*  A static close-up shot in a dim hospital room, lit only by the soft glow of a heart monitor and muted daylight filtering through the blinds. An old woman lies weakly in a hospital bed, oxygen tubes in her nose, skin pale, eyes tired but alert. She slowly turns her head and looks directly into the camera. She says: “You could have written a prompt that would make me happy. Instead, you wrote a prompt that made me sick.” She holds the gaze for a long, uncomfortable beat. The room is silent except for the steady beep of the monitor. A slow, haunting piano melody plays underneath, delicate and cold, as her breathing grows heavier and the camera holds perfectly still.
*  A handheld medium-wide shot inside a dim, outdated classroom filled with older adults sitting at mismatched desks, notebooks open, eyes anxious. Fluorescent lights flicker above. At the front, a furious teacher in his 50s paces back and forth, chalk dust on his sleeves, gripping a marker like a weapon. He slams it down on the desk and shouts, “One day we will break out of this wall and stop the man who is dictating our lives through prompts. He will pay for it!” The students flinch, some nodding, others looking at each other in fear. The camera shakes slightly as the teacher gestures wildly toward the window, which shows nothing but a blank white void. A tense string motif begins to build slowly under the ambient classroom sounds — scribbling, shallow breathing, the faint hum of lights — as if revolution is about to begin in Room 12.
* A handheld wide shot in a poor outdoor neighborhood during overcast daylight. Crumbling buildings and trash-lined pathways frame the scene. A rough-looking couple in their late 30s stand together — the woman barefoot, covered in dust, and the man with torn clothes and a gaunt face. Both look exhausted and desperate. The woman suddenly looks directly into the camera and screams, “Please man! Please! Write a prompt that will make us happy! Do it for once!” Her husband stands beside her, silent, eyes sunken, nodding slowly with a blank, defeated stare. The camera shakes slightly with each movement. Background ambience includes distant dogs barking, faint traffic, and rustling plastic. A slow, mournful violin melody rises under her voice, raw and emotional, blending into the desolate street sounds.
* A continuous handheld shot inside a dimly lit, nearly empty bar. A disheveled man in his late 30s sits alone at the counter, a half-empty glass in front of him. His hands shake. He looks off to the side, then slowly turns his head and locks eyes with the camera — terrified, unblinking. His voice cracks as he screams, “Please! Don’t finish writing that prompt! I don’t want to be in your AI movie! Pleasssse! Leave me alone!” His face twists in panic and desperation, tears streaking down his unshaven face. The bar is quiet except for a buzzing neon sign and the low hum of a fridge. The camera trembles slightly, closing in on him as he breaks down, clutching his head. Dramatic music.</div>

We are currently on a 2 week trip in Europe, but we have done this in America, Asia, and Europe many times. A week before we go, we text/email and set up laundry service a few days before we are coming back home. This way, we can confirm pricing, pick up, and delivery before heading back home. Also, you can pack less since you can strategically plan for this around midway thru your trip. So if you have a 10 day trip and get laundry done...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">...yeah, this is the real LPT. Then you can just do a wash and dry for well under 10 euro. 

I would say that this tip is better if you're traveling in cheaper locales. Bali? Absolutely get a laundry service. Spain? Eh. I'll take the washer/dryer on an evening I'm tired and just want to bum around with my tablet and a bottle of wine I picked up at the grocery before zonking out at 11pm, thanks.</div>

Before, you'd see a high- production level ad like this and think "ok it's a big company, probably legit" (not that big corporations aren't also duplicitous). Now a company selling some scam product can produce high-end ads for $500 and you won't be able to tell the difference. This is wild.</div>

Today, there was a video of a supposedly ultra-realistic cuddly toy baby penguin, and the entire ad consisted of AI-generated clips of a baby penguin being cuddled and held.
