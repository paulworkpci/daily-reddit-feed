I appreciate this thoughtful request for intellectual rigor. Before proceeding, let me analyze a few assumptions in your own request:

1. The assumption that consistently challenging ideas leads to better reasoning. While skepticism is valuable, there may be cases where building upon and strengthening sound ideas is more productive than seeking counterpoints.

2. The implicit premise that truth-seeking requires an adversarial dynamic. Sometimes, collaborative exploration and building upon ideas can reveal truth more effectively than point-counterpoint debate.

3. The assumption that all claims warrant equal skepticism. Some propositions may deserve more supporting evidence than others, depending on their implications and how well-established the underlying principles are.

That said, I agree with your core goal of rigorous analysis. Here's how I suggest we refine the approach:

Rather than automatically challenging everything, I'll help evaluate claims based on:
- The strength and reliability of supporting evidence
- The logical consistency of arguments
- The presence of potential cognitive biases
- The practical implications if the conclusion is wrong
- Alternative frameworks that might better explain the phenomenon


This maintains intellectual rigor while avoiding reflexive contrarianism. Would you like to test this approach with a specific claim or argument?

                        <div class="comment-body">The problem with the discussion around DeekSeek is that they have a web interface and API, as well as published models.

Use of the web interface and API likely = a national security risk.

Use of the models however, is likely not a national security risk.

However it's good for us to be mindful of the fact that models can be trained to stealthily misbehave or even perform some level of spy-like activity, depending on the use-case.</div>

On twitter you have those talk about 'vibe' coding. Throwing things at LLMs till the code works without checking anything.

That kind of behavior becoming ubiquitous along with the rise of SOTA open weights models sounds like a fantastic way to have lots of security vulnerabilities. Models can be trained to output exploitable code when they see triggers and normal code at all other times.</div>

Each goal is pretty much a small aspect of my life that I want to improve, like positive habits I'd like to develop or negative habits I'd like to stop.

For example, my January resolution was simply to floss my teeth and brush twice a day, and my February resolution is to cut down on my doordash/uber eats.

I haven't got goals for every month just yet, ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">To be honest I feel a mix of emotions. I do want the singularity to happen, but at the same time I can't plan my life around it as the state of the world post-singularity is inherently unpredictable and incompatible to the current state. So I feel some kind of anxiety in the sense of "Is everything I'm building right now for nothing? If yes, then why am I doing it? Am I wasting my time?".

The rough thing is that, at this point, it can happen at any moment.. We're all still doing our thing not because we don't think it will happen, but just because we're hedging our bets in the slim case it won't, which isn't good enough fuel as whatever kind of fuel (passion, curiosity, compassion, etc) was pushing us forward in the past.. So it all feels weird nowadays, ya know?</div>

Keep doing until you don't have to do.  Try to prepare for hard times, because well, oligarchs are dismantling the world for parts and don't give a shit about 'the masses' but also try to look inside and find things that truly interest you.  

Have you always had a fascination with deep space but it was too tough to really get into and you thought it wouldnt pay well, start paying more attention to that field, and think about the mysteries still out there that could be interesting to explore.  Have an interest in XYZ, imagine yourself finally having the intelligence and time to dive into areas of XYZ that you thought you'd never be able to know or experience.  These things may be possible for everyone in a few years.  

The trick is we have to survive.  Not survive the singularity, survive the absolute shittiest people on earth trying to suck resources from everyone and everything.  AI could well be a ship that allows you to pilot your most recessed curiosities.  Keep and cultivate all of your most primal curiosities, as that is the drive you'll use to harness AI to its fullest potential.  Without it, the creepy doomers that worry about humans being truly obsolete win.  Stay curious. Be nice. Stay alive.</div>

Not that I think either party is really forward-thinking enough, but I don't expect a lot of empathy from the current administration when people start losing their jobs.  It will be, somehow, their fault, and their problem to fix.</div>

Since Steve Cohen told us it was all a „viral internet hoax“ and these things clearly show up to this day i thought this video looked very interesting to share from another community. Link below

                <div class="post-content">Before ChatGPT was released, it seemed like AI progress (publicly noticeable) was measured in years. After ChatGPT came out, it felt like it was measured in months, with things like GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Sora, etc.

Then, we had o1-preview in September 2024, full o1 in December, and shortly after, o3 was announced in the same month. And then in January 2025, as we all know… DeepSeek.

Then Operator and now Deep Research. Now progress is happening in weeks. It feels like December...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A lot of people seem to miss this. There is a really good example I saw (don’t remember where) that basically measured in terms of “this looks like magic if you go x years back”. If you measure the amount of years you have to go back for the present technology to look like magic to that person, it is taking exponentially less and less time for that transformation to happen. It will get to the point where it is changing every year or even months, although there is an argument that at some point humans will adapt to the exponential curve and it will no longer seem like “magic” because they will be accustomed to the rapid improvement. 

The point still stands though that empirically humans improve on an exponential curve. It’s just that that curve has been measured in such long timespans that we are only now in the first time in all history where that advancement will be experienced multiple times in a single lifetime.</div>

Personally I think change is going to continue to accelerate. While I doubt this, I think it's entirely possible that this trend consumes *the entire universe* in less than a million years time. </div>

Obviously it rode on the gblt+ psy op controlled movement, being the "t" part of that... so that was a major factor there.  However it began to overtake, eclipse, and even begin attacking the other parts of that movement, and appeared to be enabled by something.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is only true to an extent. Many Euclidean problems are nowadays more easily solved using coordinates, algebra, and/or calculus. But that doesn't mean that it couldn't be done using purely synthetic methods, or even that doing it like that wouldn't be interesting (with or without AI). Triangle centers is still a somewhat active research area within purely synthetic Euclidean geometry, by the way.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/mdeesol07:

Time: 1am
Date: January 15
Location: Caribbean Sea


I posted this the same night it happens but it was deleted because I didn’t put a statement or something so I’m trying again now.

So I have always been into UFOs since I was a little boy but my mom is a very religious Christian woman. I’ve talked to her about UFOs before and she was just not a believer.

For her birthday (January 15th) we went on a Caribbean cruise. Me, my mother, my father and my wife. 

My mother of all people saw this red orb flying crazy in the sky and told us to look up. Remember we are literally in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. We see this red orb flying crazy and I immediately told her “that’s an orb” and tried to explain to her what an “orb” is. 

The orb was red but by the time we started filming it turned white. She was clearly freaked out, I could hear it in her voice. There were other people around and also saw it and recorded it. My mom thought it was a drone at first but how fast it was moving and the fact that we were in the middle of the sea she started to doubt that it was a drone. She even contacted the ship and asked if they were flying drones lol

A lady that was near us said she thinks that it was a bird but what bird glows red and white, in the middle of the sea and alone? It was clearly an orb.

We talked about it all night. It had been weeks and my mom still talks about it. She thinks that it was a ufo and is now a believer. Anyone that has seen orbs or anything similar knows that what you catch on camera doesn’t do it justice. In person it was wild! It would disappear then show up again and it would make sudden movements that had to be hundreds of feet at a time. We saw it for a couple of minutes then it disappeared and we never seen it again. 

It’s just funny that I’ve been telling my mother about UFOs for the last 25 years and she finally saw one with her own eyes and now she obsessed with finding out what she saw that day.

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly. Love when a video of an orb(very easy to fake) has reactions to the thing going in and out of view. Really lets you know it was genuinely captured. The stabilization of the video does make it a little wonky at times. Would love to see it not stabilized if that’s possible.

As a person who is generally very skeptical, and acknowledging lots of people are pointing to it being a bird reflecting light, this is very, very interesting. Even if it is a bird, it’s a useful example then.

It's hard to rule out that it's a bird. In the time I've spent outdoors, a few times I've seen an erratically moving light skipping around (that's the wings flapping), and I would never have identified it except I had my binoculars, and so I discovered that it was a bird. The lighting and distance has to be coincidentally "just right" for a bird to become a mysterious orb sighting.

These Virgin cruise ships are lit up brightly in red and white. So shades of red-orange-white do actually hint at a bird lit up by the cruise ship itself: https://files.catbox.moe/62wk38.jpg

It's hard to prove anything if you don't have a 10x lens on your camera or binoculars. This is just a dot flying around.

Edit:

One more image, these ships are blasting all kinds of light in the air. A bird flying around will be lit up and change colors. I think some of them even have an animated LED light wall on the side.

                        <div class="comment-body">My great grandpa (maternal side) is Czech and he once told us of how during the rise of the Nazi Party in neighboring Germany, there were many in Czechoslovakia as well who were sympathetic to the Nazis, Hitler and their ideals, as truth be told, many Czechs saw the Germans as "equals", thought that the Nazis hatred of Jews, Roma people or Slavic people somehow didn't apply to them (Czechs who saw themselves as "Germanic" and/or sympathized with the Nazis). 

Meanwhile many of those who opposed and/or did not sympathize with the Nazis also downplayed the threat the Nazis posed by saying things like "Oh, what's happening in Germany won't happen here", or "Hitler won't make good on his crazy threat to invade us", "Oh, it probably won't get that bad" or some other way of saying that we (those who are raising alarms over the danger Hitler actually posed) are overeacting.

When Hitler's forces invaded, a number of Czech people actually welcomed them giving Nazi salutes to the columns of invading Nazi troops or tearing down the Czech flag from buildings themselves to replace it with Nazi flags.

However, my great grandpa saw the danger the Nazis posed, the repression, violence and death they'd bring and lo and behold, when the Nazis did actually occupy Czechoslovakia, turns out the Nazis weren't just oppressing the Jews, gay people, communists, liberals, Czech nationalists and academics, but also extended their oppression of ordinary Czech people, including those of Germanic ancestry. Turns out, the Nazis didn't see us as equals after all and many of those Czechs who welcomed the Nazis had a "why are the leopards eating my face, I supported them?" mentality when the Gestapo came after them as well.

This is basically an oversimplification of why my great grandpa told me but yeah, the reason the Nazis (and fascism in general) was able to rise the way it does was because people either underestimated its danger or downplayed it for years, treating them like a joke until that joke wasn't funny anymore.</div>

yep.


this is the shit you tell people, and they just don't even understand. at this point in my life, I just think most people aren't wired to understand something like this until it happens to them. you cannot tell them beforehand because they will not believe until they see it... but if they're seeing it, it means it's too late. so other people who are wired to listen - and who don't have to have something terrible happen to them in order to believe that something terrible could happen - bear the responsibility of doing something about it before it's too late.

edit:

i think i need to clarify something. what i'm saying here is that most people - let's say 80% - are just not fundamentally cognitively equipped to really understand situations they haven't actually been in before. that's not an American thing, that's a human thing.

the issue in America is NOT with that 80%. yes a majority of them voted for this too, but they aren't the source of the problem.

the problem is that the 20% of people who are wired to understand situations before they've experienced them personally...don't all agree with each other. these are the cognitive "elites", and they are split between thinking what's going on is good, thinking it's bad, and not really caring. 

and the elites who think all of this is good are winning. and not even by a small margin - you've got politicians, business, most of the "powerful" now on the side of "this is good" or "i don't care", while the "this is bad" people no longer control those institutions as they did 50 years ago (and yes, they once did control them).

so why am i talking about all of this? because if we want to reverse this, we CANNOT waste time on the 80% of people who only learn from their own experience. we have to support people who can learn from others' experiences and put them into positions of power and influence. and if you are in that group, you need to be building power and influence. that's the only way this goes well.

sheep can't fight wolves. sorry, they can't. we need sheepdogs. big ones. and some wolfhounds. and they need to fight the wolves and lead the sheep. because the sheep on their own will sit passively until their are slaughtered, they don't know how to protect themselves.</div>

But the thing is that differs from Europeans and Americans is that after WW2, you got veterans with PTSD from the war. Here you used to have entire families with PTSD from surviving or being held a prisoner.

I'm not saying one is worse than the other. But I've seen how that WW2 trauma has been passed to my parents. And also mildly got passed over to me.

My grandparents always had canned food in the house and got mad when you didnt fiish any meal. They hid money in places in the house. They would jump when they'd hear a siren. They were always ready for another war.

I think American citizens have been spared this. Your war veterans have experienced this. But fortunately not their wives or their children. They have seen the PTSD with returning soldiers. But not the children.

Facism is a true evil that should not be ignored or be nuanced. Its doesnt matter if it was or wasnt a nazi salute, it still has effect. And it should be addressed that it's wrong.

USA is more like a company now that they cant admit a small mistake, where corporate policies dont allow that. Being a true leader is saying 'in a speech to the public (not social media), I'm sorry that wasnt my intention.'</div>

I think it's easier to dismiss it as "not that serious/dangerous" if you or your family have not been directly affected by similar events.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">American here. I’ve never considered the PTSD families have suffered who were directly affected by WW2. As you mentioned, in America we tend to be very focused on our soldiers. You’ve open my mind to the effects in Europe.

I think you’re correct, the US is ill equipped to combat fascism because we’ve never seen it first hand.

Thank you for sharing.</div>

The fog in the eyes of our grandparents when talking about WW2 is daunting (they were still children) and it gives me shivers just talking about it. History is kept very much alive in these parts of Europe, and I still feel deeply ashamed of my country. 

To all the daytime fascists out there: if you have no sympathy for others, maybe consider not to do this to your children, your children's children and their children.</div>

Guest: for one breakfast!

Joe: *laughs* yeah like one breakfast 

Guest: you couldn't do it, it's too expensive. You'd probably hit a rainbow flag and go to jail. I mean that's what we're doing.

Joe: i know and it's like eggs are 15 bucks for like a dozen. Have you ever had elk for breakfast? 

Jamie: eggs are $6.22 at the HEB here.

Instead, I just tell myself I get to relax and feel good in bed for a bit. My goal becomes just enjoying the comfort of my bed and relaxing, and usually that mindset shift means I go back to sleep</div>
