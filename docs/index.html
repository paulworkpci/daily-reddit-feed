* Laundry (end to end)
* Mopping
* Loading / unloading the dishwasher
* Flattening cardboard boxes
* Taking out the trash + bringing bins back on garbage day
* Vacuuming

If a robot could nail these, I’m pretty sure people would happily drop **$30–50K**. Can’t wait for that future to show up.</div>

Also, ask for feedback and input if it’s not being given

Most importantly-enjoy the journey 

Also, drink water. Before and after.</div>

When GPT5 came out I tried it on chatgpt and it was great. Tried it on cursor as an agent... and it was unusable. Pure garbage.

Later they fixed it. I think it's one of the best models together with sonnet 4 and opus 4/4.1

So my experience pretty much aligns with web dev arena leaderboards. For most other benchmarks I like things aren't very different. GPT5 is the leading model, or opus 4.1+, and sonnet 4 either comes third or close.

People keep depicting this as kind of a doomsday scenario, but I don't: it is more like everyone survives on food stamps while the rich lives in opulent wealth. The thing is, regular people are still gonna live out lives, it just won't be as glamorous, and there is little possibiilty for social advancement.

But people will still continue to live and have families, life will go on.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Homeless people are homeless because they are lazy or didn't have the foresight to acquire economically relevant skills.

I on the other hand worked hard and studied hard. I just got unlucky that my skills got automated. Surely society will understand and take care of me when I can no longer contribute? The elites will understand. They must. I am not one of *those* people who are lazy and failed due to their own mistakes.

I'm not saying *everyone* should get free stuff. Only the people who truly deserve it, like me.

And yes, the above is sarcasm, in case you couldn't tell. But it just shows how absurd it is to argue for self-reliance now but expect things to change the moment unemployment reaches a certain magic threshold. If your society vilifies solidarity now, it will not suddenly change its mind when you are on the chopping block.

Even societies with a culture of solidarity towards the weak will struggle. Their values might not survive the reality that social cohesion will no longer be useful. But for those that never even cared about the weak and unfortunate, I don't have much hope at all.</div>

Top 10% of the US population drives 50% of the money spending.  In the AI future, instead of 50%, it will just be 80% of the economy driven by the top 10%.

I think this sub keeps repeating that poor people will the primary economic engine of the future cuz it feels reassuring to say out loud. Or they say that there will be some kind of violent poor people revolt.

They are reassuring fantasies to play out, sure, but not really based in reality.</div>

The ‘economy’ will become like a 4x real time strategy game where ‘you’ (a corporate worker bee far away [or maybe an AI program]) will deploy drones to extract resources in an area. Humans in the area will be the native life that are ’in the way’.  You might pay them a small amount to scout the terrain or something but they will more often be a problem than help.  So local employment will be scouting for the AI bots or hired guns as protection for the AI bots.

Few people will live in rural areas and humans will continue to migrate to shipping or logistics hubs where resources cross through in hopes that they will receive some kind of spillover resources (humans come to the hub to fix, repair or monitor drones and while they are there they stay at hotels and eat at restaurants).</div>

Do you see rich people now being super nice and generous to poor people? Absolutely not.

Why would they do it in the AI future?

Some things like land, food, clean water can't be magic'ed out of thin air, even with hyper-advanced AI. Who decides who gets these resources as the Earth ariable land gets worse and worse w/ climate change?

I think certain things, like streaming videos/video games would be super abundant and plentiful in the future. But I am not sure about everyone getting an equitable share of the increasingly scarce resources of Earth.</div>

Searching your messages is currently a text search, but if you have embeddings you can do semantic search. I.e. "I need all the addresses that have been shared with me". 

Which lets you quickly build context locally, i.e. for an agent that needs to "understand" your local data, without sending it all to the server to classify.</div>

Developers can use the full 768-dimension vector for maximum quality or truncate it to smaller dimensions (128, 256, or 512) for increased speed and lower storage costs.

That is pretty neat. If the improvements over e5-large hold true in application, this might be pretty useful.</div>

If anything and everything that could be somehow later used illegally was not allowed to be created on a ChatBot, you'd have a pretty dumb ChatBot. Most the restrictions are to prevent bad PR for the company moreso than realistic legal exposure.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">A high risk high reward move.

This is a hugely smart move for OpenAI, though it's a massive gamble. Basically, they're sick of spending an insane amount of money on Nvidia GPUs.It's the same strategy Google used with its TPUs. The only downside is the astronomical upfront cost and the risk that the project fails. But if it works, it solidifies their position in the industry.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Probably won’t amount to much tbh, they aren’t big enough (and by big i mean infrastructure wise) to really take advantage of having their own chip and probably won’t be ever. But they probably will be able to save a lot of bucks on training so still worth it.

But to really get something out of it they would need to be the size of google or Microsoft infrastructure wise to not only train but distribute it to customers. This won’t be done it’ll take close to a trillion dollars and a decade to catch up to them two years ago. As it stands they will need them for mass distribution for a long while.</div>

                <div class="post-content">So ive been meditating, reading, and watching Buddhist related videos (mostly Mahayana) alot over the past 6 months. Mostly I focus on breathing and relaxing but Id like to step it up and dedicate more time to focus on sex and pornography addiction. Has anyone had success in dealing with compulsive behaviors like that? Are there related guided meditations i should check out? Im 57 years old and have tried therapy, 12 steps, etc but none of them have stuck. Meditation is as close as ive come to f...</div>

Try one time when the urge comes, feel it immerse in it observe it and see if it comes and goes. If you have succeeded once, this means you have the absolute ability to overcome this urge, and then is the matter of consistency.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I work with men on this particular issue. It’s not uncommon to have strong sexual urges and mediation can often intensify and bring even more awareness to these compulsive tendencies. 

Learning to circulate the sexual energy through your entire body, not just your genitals, can be very helpful. The Hollow Bamboo Meditation technique Will Johnson teaches is what I’d personally recommend. The strong breathing along with pelvic rocking can release deep samskaric patterns that are stored as tension in the body. Deep beneath most addictive behaviors is stored trauma and pain which we try to dissociate from. Sex provides only momentary release from this pain which then returns. 

Will’s recent book is highly recommended: [The Radical Path of Somatic Dharma: Radiant Body, Radiant Mind](https://a.co/d/hWdVVwz)

If you’d like to reach out and get more assistance, we could go more into how meditation could be combined with other techniques to help overcome compulsive behavior. I could also share a video course on the Hollow Bamboo Meditation Program I recorded.

                        <div class="comment-body">Consider what led you to use it in the first place, meaning was it to feel better when you felt a certain way, such as when you felt something like lonely, depressed, or stressed, or something like that. Then consider if this is still the case that you turn to it when you feel this way, and learn to 1. abide with that feeling for a while without doing anything to avoid it, basically doing mindfulness with it, and 2. identify the core needs that you are trying to meet each time you use it, but that the use of it is like an artificial second best for, and work on practical steps to meet those needs in a way that suits you and your situation and is helpful, skillful, wholesome and wise. Things you can do now and things you can work on over time. Some of which I will address in a paragraph below. This would be addressing the root cause.

You can also counter the habit at certain other points. You can notice the tendency to fantasize, meaning to add extra qualities to something from the senses or mind that were not there originally, and then make a scenario out of that which often does not align with reality, meaning it is self delusion. Meaning you see a person or you think of them and then your mind puts them in an attractive posture or a specific scenario, and adds qualities like attractive clothes, hair, make up, accessories, and then makes them do things that you find attractive. You can counter this by removing those qualities instead. Imagine the person with normal looking hair, or no hair, with normal clothes and in a normal sitting or standing posture. With no make up and no accessories. Even if you imagine the person naked, but in a normal sitting or standing posture, and with no make up, normal or no hair, no accessories, etc. then you will likely find they are not attractive, as it is just form with a function. It is just the human body and every part has a function, and it is simply this. So if you take attractive qualities away with your mind rather than add them, that is countering the tendency to fantasize.

Also you can remove any porn if you have it in the house meaning throw it away or whatever and don't replace it, and make it more difficult for yourself to access it, setting up website blocks to it if you know how to do that and if you think it is needed. Then there is no temptation from the environment. It is the same as not having alcohol in the house if you wish to quit drinking and then resolving not to buy any either.

Then when a craving arises, you can do a form of mindfulness on that craving, you can observe the experience of it and notice how it changes over time, doing that ideally until the craving passes naturally. You observe the sensations in the body, while allowing them to be but not acting on them, doing that as it changes and goes. You do it collectively but it can include things like pressure, heat, tension, the impulse to act, pleasant sensation, you observe it until it passes according to its conditions. If something arises in the mind to stimulate it, gently turn your attention from this trigger of the feeling to the actual feeling itself and then observe that feeling in a sustained way until it normalises. This deconditions the habit over time.

Then you can also find things to replace the habit that are closer to meeting the actual core needs and are more helpful, skillful, wholesome and wise. Find a way to have human contact, or find something uplifting to do, or a worthy cause or project to work on, or do some exercise to give a similar feeling of exertion for the body which is good for it but not sexual. Or do meditation as this can make you more intimate with yourself and can meet the need for intimacy in some way as the need for intimacy might be another reason that people use porn.

So to summarise, learn to be with what you are feeling even if it is negative, identify the core needs that you were trying to meet in some way with the habit, and take practical steps to meet them in a wholesome and helpful way such as carefully chosen replacement activities, counter the tendency to fantasise, remove any temptation from your environment, and practice observing the craving until it passes. All of these together when done over time can completely decondition the habit.</div>

Before, I used to wonder at the end of the month why my money was gone. Now I can catch it early, like noticing I spent too much on food delivery or random snacks.

It’s a small habit, but it keeps me in control and less stressed about money.</div>
