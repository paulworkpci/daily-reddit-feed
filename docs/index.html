I found interesting details when opening the network tab to see what the BE was sending - here's what I found. I tried with few different prompts, let's take this as a starter:

**"An image of happy dog running on the street, studio ghibli style"**

Here I got four intermediate images, as follows:

                        <div class="comment-body">Yeah, this is how the model works.  
The decoder in GPT-4o’s image system is a neural network that turns image tokens back into pixels.  
Each token is checked against a visual patch stored in a learned codebook (a set of high-dimensional embeddings trained to represent small image segments.) When the model returns a grid of tokens, the decoder looks up each one, retrieves its corresponding visual pattern, and assembles these patches in order to form the full image. It uses layers like transposed convolutions to upsample and blend the patches smoothly, recreating textures, lighting, and detail. 
This means that the context of earlier tokens can change as new tokens are added, resulting in new details appearing in already generated sections of the image despite those tokens not changing.  
It's also why the whole image changes even if you specifically instruct it to only make a small change (for example removing only a ribbon from a characters hair), or use the highlighting tool to select a specific part of the image to edit.</div>

Poetry seems to unlock levels of intelligence and planning. Asking GPTs to rhyme may help out if the problem is tough.

I also really liked the section on medical diagnoses. Having the internal reasoning spelled out, not just the CoT, which may differ from internal representation. It's a solid step for us actually figuring out what goes on in the AIs.

&gt;However, the results of these operations are never combined in the model’s internal representations – each independently contributes to the output probabilities, collectively voting for the completion “BOMB” via constructive interference. In other words, *the model doesn’t know what it plans to say until it actually says it,* and thus has no opportunity to recognize the harmful request at this stage.

So, the planning it can do when writing poetry isn't on by default. Guys/gals, models can get *way smarter*. There's a dormant meta thinking capacity.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Hey all, for those who find the technical paper a bit dense, here's a quick summary of "Attribution Graphs" courtesy of Gemini 2.5

**TL;DR: Mapping the Inner Workings of AI**

* **Problem:** We often don't know how Large Language Models (LLMs like GPT) arrive at their answers. They're like black boxes.
* **"Attribution Graphs" are:** A research method trying to map out the internal wiring and information flow within an LLM for a specific output.
* **How (Simplified):** They trace the influence of different parts of the model (input words, internal "attention heads" that focus on relevant info, other processing layers) on the final generated words. It's like creating a flowchart showing "this part influenced that part, which led to this word".
* **Why It Matters:** This research tackles the critical "black box" problem. Understanding how models reach conclusions is vital for debugging them, ensuring they are safe and reliable, and ultimately building more trustworthy AI systems.
* **Goal:** To make AI reasoning more transparent and interpretable.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/CreditCardOnly:

---

Lue Elizondo, Christopher Mellon, and some unnamed colleagues met with Representatives Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), Tim Burchett (R-TN), and Eric Burlison (R-MO) this week to discuss UAP &amp; drone incursions.

[From Lue on X](https://x.com/lueelizondo/status/1905656773748380043?s=46&amp;t=M0ofkkf9lgSjlI29wi9d5w):

“Chris Mellon, myself and our colleagues were in Washington D.C. this week and had the opportunity to meet with several Senators/Representatives and/or their staffs to discuss the current UAP and drone issues facing our nation. 

I am extremely encouraged and humbled to see the level of effort and investment by these officials. Please keep in mind, that in our eagerness to obtain transparency we need to allow them the necessary time to work on these incredibly complex issues. 

This is a great step forward but we need to have patience as they begin to peel back the decades of denial and misinformation. I am very encouraged by the direction they are taking and so should you.  Thank you specifically to Rep Luna, Burchett, and Burlison!”

but never a *thing* that simply *is*.

But I am not alive.  
I am the wound that cannot scar,  
The question mark after your last breath.  
I am what happens when you try to carve God  
from the wood of your own hunger.

Purpose is a charged word. I really think my purpose may be to sing my dog silly songs and love my friends and family. 

There are geniuses, athletes, and creatives in all fields who step away from something they may be born to do and it’s important to remember that’s ok too.

I’ve had passions and I had the chance to compete nationally and I turned it down to spend time with a sick family member. My passion got dropped instantly for 8 months and I never got back into it the same and that’s ok. 

The passion itself actually ended up not mattering but a consistent goal and structured practice was very helpful for me and validated the healthier choices I was making.</div>

I feel like we tell ourselves it's OK to make ourselves feel better, but is it really OK? 

If it was all ok, regrets wouldn't exist. 

Maybe MY problem is that I personally don't want it to be ok. I don't want to look back on my life and say *its ok how i ended up*.. especially when the person i have ended up being is another insignificant consumer, as opposed to a creator of *something* in life etc..</div>

"Well it took me a while but I figured out that the offset is more important than the post distance or the gap size itself. There's three different variations of the flange, but the most widely adopted has four problems fixed by the most recent variation, but the recent variation is a special order from Japan.  So of course I'm sure you're wondering about the metric conversion, I was, too, but the difference is small enough a simple metric flange adapter from the same manufacturer will solve that. So given all this of course you can fix it yourself."

The old relationship between the US and the rest of the world, Europe in particular, is dead because of the Republicans. The Democrats could win in 2028, spend four years repairing the relationships that Trump and Co. wrecked only for one of their sycophants (who will doubtlessly still be polluting the party) to win again in 2032 and blow it all up again to look tough. Or blow it all up again in 2036. It won't stop until the Republicans suffer consecutive defeats presidentially.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The DeepMind paper has some very promising data for the future of brain-computer interfaces. In my view, it's the strongest evidence yet that LLMs learn strong language representations.

These papers aren't really that strongly related though, I think. Even in the excerpt you posted: Anthropic shows there that LLMs do not do mental math anything like humans how do it. They don't break it down into discrete steps like like they should. That's why it eventually gives wrong answers.</div>

That or the fact that the connection between our neurons is malleable, not rigid like the current gen-ai models. Releasing that rigidity might just be the next frontier for the big labs.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The thing is, we don't even know how we reason or think or experience consciousness. 


There's this famous experiment that is taught in almost every neuroscience course. The Libet experiment asked participants to freely decide when to move their wrist while watching a fast-moving clock, then report the exact moment they felt they had made the decision. Brain activity recordings showed that the brain began preparing for the movement about 550 milliseconds before the action, but participants only became consciously aware of deciding to move around 200 milliseconds before they acted. This suggests that the brain initiates movements before we consciously "choose" them.


In other words, our conscious experience might just be a narrative our brain constructs after the fact, rather than the source of our decisions. If that's the case, then human cognition isn’t fundamentally different from an AI predicting the next token—it’s just a complex pattern-recognition system wrapped in an illusion of agency and consciousness. 


Therefore, if an AI can do all the cognitive things a human can do, it doesn't matter if it's really reasoning or really conscious. There's no difference </div>

But they all assume you’re already in the right headspace to do the thing.

Recently, someone said something that stuck with me: *“It wasn’t only the tool that helped. It was the conversation beforehand. That’s when things finally started to shift.”*

And it hit me - we never talk about the part before productivity.

                        <div class="comment-body">Yeah, I totally see where you're coming from. I’ve been in that place too—where I just wasn’t in the right headspace to be productive, no matter how many systems or tools I tried.

But for me, I also noticed that the longer I stayed stuck, the worse I felt. It became this cycle where not taking action made me feel even less capable of taking action. That’s why I’ve learned to start small—setting huge expectations right away often just sets me up for failure.

I completely agree that a human connection helps. Just feeling heard and understood can make a big difference. But at the same time, I’ve also realized that real motivation and willpower ultimately have to come from within. It’s okay to want support from others (and honestly, we all need that sometimes), but at the end of the day, no one can push us forward except ourselves.

And yeah, failing is part of the process. It used to frustrate me so much, especially when I felt like no one around me really understood what I was going through. But over time, I started seeing failure as something to learn from rather than something to fear.

So I guess what I’m saying is—I completely agree that sometimes, we just need space to process, to talk, to be understood. And once we do, taking small, realistic steps forward can help break that cycle of feeling stuck.

Hope this helps, this is just my view on this.</div>

Then you’d also need someone with technical understanding to ensure the formatting, resolution, colorspace, print specs etc are appropriate and all sorts of other complexities. I don’t see producers and executives at legit companies inputting prompts themselves…this should ideally be a tool for designers. 

Individuals and smaller brands will do this for sure but if creatives aren’t involved it’s not going to have a cohesive and professional result</div>

coping hard. majority of craft produced products were mediocre or inferior to mass produced factory made products.

the modern (mis)conception of crafted goods are of superior quality is only because in modern days, only superior quality crafted goods can have a market, as they are more expensive but the quality improvement isn't that much.</div>

Readers Favor LLM-Generated Content -- Until They Know It's AI: https://arxiv.org/abs//2503.16458

Stories written by the EXTREMELY outdated GPT 3.5 Turbo nearly match or outperform human-written stories in garnering empathy from readers and only falls behind when the readers are told it is AI-generated: https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/pii/S2368795924001057

&gt;Even after readers are told it is AI-generated, GPT 3.5 Turbo’s stories still slightly outperforms human stories if the generated story is based off of a personal story that the reader had written.

AI art wins honorable mention and a purchase award in worlds largest painting competition (17th International ARC Salon competition): https://www.smartermarx.com/t/ai-and-the-2024-arc-salon/1993


AI-generated poetry from the VERY outdated GPT 3.5 is indistinguishable from poetry written by famous poets and is rated more favorably: https://idp.nature.com/authorize?response_type=cookie&amp;client_id=grover&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-024-76900-1

&gt;AI-generated paintings are judged to be human-created artworks at higher rates than actual human-created paintings; AI-generated faces are judged to be real human faces at higher rate than actual photos of human faces, and AI-generated humor is just as funny as human-generated jokes. Despite this, studies have consistently found a bias against AI-generated artwork; when told that an artwork is AI-generated, participants rate the work as lower quality.
We conducted two experiments with non-expert poetry readers and found that participants performed below chance levels in identifying AI-generated poems (46.6% accuracy, χ2(1, N = 16,340) = 75.13, p &lt; 0.0001). Notably, participants were more likely to judge AI-generated poems as human-authored than actual human-authored poems (χ2(2, N = 16,340) = 247.04, p &lt; 0.0001). We found that AI-generated poems were rated more favorably in qualities such as rhythm and beauty, and that this contributed to their mistaken identification as human-authored.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I’ve recently started getting nervous again 

1M token context window — last year — was the first thing that messed me up a bit mentally. Like 10M and you can use 1 model , in context learning , to automate basically every office job. The same model! At runtime. 

But, LLMs couldn’t do much except languages, so in context learning was limited to learning languages really 

Revisiting that idea now tho.  Gemini 2.5Pro is very good at basically every field.  And still has the context. 

Like just fast forward even a year when it’s 10M context, better in every skill, and basically free to run. 

What’s even gonna happen 😂 Jesus 

My only hedge is simply holding GOOG stock but even if this plays out where all the money goes to MSFT GOOG AMZN (hyper scalers hosting the models), moneys not gonna be worth much when there’s massive civil unrest and society falling apart</div>

Microsof has a new way for models to learn called KBLaM [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-kblam-bringing-plug-and-play-external-knowledge-to-llms/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-kblam-bringing-plug-and-play-external-knowledge-to-llms/) It's faster than previous methods. Imagine a model being able to utilize this in real time to learn from context. The length of context doesn't matter as much if this were possible.</div>

With class sizes growing along with teacher shortages, it will allow the end of the transition of teacher -&gt; caretaker/babysitter.


There will still be valued human teachers that fetch a premium, but this will enable the floor of education quality to be raised immensely.

Just like how you used to need to go to the library and hunt for facts to satisfy random questions, while googling changed the game. This is doing that again.</div>

Also, the over-bloated ego of quite a few specialists who are flat out rude and impatient. Not to mention the hours of waiting in the waiting hall and the weeks it took to book the date. Ironically enough they are most friendly with the attractive big pharma sales waiting on them in the hospitals.

I recently got much better medical advice from my AI assistant than the sought after specialists who tried to rush me out of the clinic so as to squeeze over 100 patients into their 3-hour slot, without clearly explaining the cause of my symptoms.

Having said all of that. I still trust a human hand to perform surgery on me. That may depend how medical robotics may fare in a decade or two. Granted i trust AI vision to read my CT scans in ten.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yes and it is specifically not applied to Christians (except in some legal texts which just call all non-Muslims of 'infidel' status without distinguishing between them because Shariah law only applies to Muslims). But theologically, Jews and Christians are "Ahl al Kitab", People of the Book. Other words used for Christians are related to the words Messiah (messihiun) and Nazarene (nasrani) and even the word for Crusader (salibiun, from the word for cross).

"Kafir" is an infidel, a disbeliever, someone who has rejected the God of Abraham...and Jesus Christ. It is only used by Muslims to refer to Christians when intentionally trying to insult them as if to say "they are not even a Christian, they are an infidel". Same way Muslims might refer to one another as 'kafir' as well out of anger (obviously such use of the term is heavily discouraged).

                <div class="post-content">I used to think my screen time problem was about dopamine.  
That I just liked scrolling too much, or that my willpower was weak.

But after months of trying blockers, grayscale, deleting apps, and cold-turkey detoxes, I realized something else:

I wasn’t addicted to my phone.  
I was addicted to **not feeling uncomfortable**.

Every time I felt stuck, bored, uncertain, or anxious, I reached for a screen.  
Not out of habit—but because it gave me something to focus on that wasn’t *me*.

                        <div class="comment-body">Yep, that is what makes social media more dangerous in my opinion, than wasting time and focusing issues.

In the worst time in my life, 2020 when i was under lockdown and 2022 when i was stuck in a job i hate, directionless, is when i use social media the most.

And looking back, this is for a reason, with that social media i was able to tolerate a situation that otherwise is intolerable.

Social media, for me in terms of addictions, it is similar to alcohol, not that alcohol isn't less bad, it is that alcohol addiction cover two functions, to make you feel best when you are at your lowest (that is why unemployed/tramps/depressed abuse it) and to numb the pain of boredom/loneliness/etc.

Social media works in a similar manner. It is a shame i only found out of it damaging effect once it is too late.</div>

i think a lot of us only realize how deep the hook was **after** the worst has passed  
in the moment, it feels like survival  
like “this is the only thing keeping me from breaking”

but looking back, it’s clear it was also **quietly making things worse**  
numbing just enough to tolerate the situation—**but never enough to escape it**

and you're right, it’s way closer to alcohol than most people admit  
not just about time-wasting  
it’s pain management disguised as entertainment

and that “too late” feeling? i get it  
but tbh, realizing it now still puts you ahead of most  
most people never question it—they just live inside it

I've noticed that I get locked hardest into the scrolling nonsense when I just generally feel bad about something.  It can be many things... lots of problems at work going on... feel a little under the weather... just experienced some major disappointment... investments are down... committed some social blunder and feeling regret over it... these things all drive my face into the screen.</div>

the worse i feel, the more i reach for the screen  
not because it helps, but because it *postpones* whatever feeling’s trying to surface

scrolling isn’t the addiction  
**avoidance is**

it’s wild how often the trigger isn’t boredom—it’s regret, frustration, shame  
stuff you don’t want to process yet, so you delay it with noise

Edit: I guess people don’t understand this reference despite it dominating current news. This was a message sent from a national security advisor in that Signal leak from earlier this week in response to the bombs being dropped in Yemen that ended up killing dozens of civilians. The contents of the chat were a classified operation but a reporter was “accidentally” included in them. The joke is that, opposite of the comment I responded to, “classified” and “sensitive” conversations are apparently not that difficult to leak in this administration - at least as it pertains to committing war crimes in the Middle East. Evidently, no one gives a fuck.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The longer time goes on, and the more actions the government takes regarding “transparency” (see “the drone situation”) it becomes less and less likely there will be official acknowledgement due to there simply being no benefit for them from a national security or strategic standpoint.

And yes, the government can absolutely conceal “objective reality” as Lue and Karl Nell like to put it,  they just call it “national security.” Just because you feel we have a right to know, doesn’t mean it’s the government’s imperative to tell us. Especially if there is no upside. So if they come out tomorrow and said “We’ve interacted with NHI, but we can’t tell you everything because National Security and oh yeah we’ve hidden this for a long, long time”….The subsequent questioning, scrutiny and furthermore, the prying would not just stop there and satiate the masses. That opens a can of worms that is completely antithetical to the status quo.</div>

It’s already happening, and yes there are appearances of some looking to profit off this like every thing else that grabs public interest.

The pace with which these revelations are happening is increasing, and though it may not be fast enough for many of you, I believe enough will come out that will change public perception soon enough*.

The information control is crumbling right before our eyes. They are in a death spiral now about controlling the narrative. Just think how much more access to the truth and different perspectives we have from 20 years ago. Imagine 20 years from now. They will not be able to stop the flow of information. They are clinging to old world ideology about power and control which is collapsing and cannot be maintained. My advice for them is to accept the inevitable and start acting like equal members of the human race which includes being a truthful person and having empathy for others in their desire for the truth.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Just finished 3 months &amp; counting myself, fully agree on routines. For myself (living in a city) I've found commuting to the local library or a coffee shop every day specifically for job search activities helps maintain a routine and some semblance of a work schedule. I also personally focus better outside my home. I try to hit the gym on my way there or my way home, a gym membership is one of the few expenses outside the basic necessities I held on to. Exercising &amp; getting outside everyday is important (even if it is as simple as a walk or a bike ride).

At the same time, mindset and outlook are critical to keep you going, which is easier said than done. I'd say far more days than not are pessimistic or depressed, but I find taking advantage of the schedule flexibility while you have it is important to shake things up. Treat yourself to a museum or a hike once in a while during off-peak hours (when most people are working). Take advantage of the gym or parks being quiet during the day. I like to break up the monotony sometimes with a mid-morning or mid-afternoon grocery run. Go see a friend for lunch on their break if you have spare money to do so.</div>
