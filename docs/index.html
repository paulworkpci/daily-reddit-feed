                                <div class="reply-body">It’s only over 1 when considering just the thin film capacitor, not the high voltage power supply. They’ll need to be able to consistently replicate this and do it in a way that rules out electrostatic or other parasitic interactions with the environment.

You can rub a balloon on your head and get it to demonstrate “greater than 1 TWR” by holding another charged balloon near it. A piece of candy wrapper that keeps sticking to your fingers can easily have greater than 1 TWR.

They’ll need a repeatable setup in a vacuum chamber and they’ll need to demonstrate why it’s not interacting through conventional means. This will then need to be replicated. All of this takes time. 

I am very dubious that their theoretical explanation is correct, but they might inadvertently have stumbled across an effect some other theory like quantized inertia can explain. If it’s a capacitor with electron tunneling current, that very well could explain it. Of course, QI could also be wrong.</div>

All the conservatives are terrified to have much focus on this, just the fact that they were using Signal was violating the Federal Records Act because there is no permanent record of the communications. They will use any means they can to distract from that. 

I mean, even if it was hacked by a journalist with no technical expertise. What does that say about our enemies' ability to access our sensitive cabinet-level communications.</div>

It's been 3 days since I started reading consistently and deleted all social media. After a 6 hour study session today (took breaks in between ofc), I decided to watch a YouTube video (no BS. It was pretty informative). Then I scrolled through the business subreddit and little did I know how crazy it was gonna get.

                        <div class="comment-body">I think I know how you feel.

A long time ago, I did my own little "meditation retreat". No electronics, 2-3h of Meditation and multiple hours of reading every day. Apart from that I did Tai Chi, Yoga and went for walks.

After just 3 days of that, I felt completely different. I was so calm and happy as I haven't been in 10 years. And when I went back to using the Internet it was astonishing. Just being on the Youtube frontpage annoyed the heck out of me, because there was too much going on and, even more interestingly, I was annoyed by the non-importance of that stuff. It was like:"Why would I want to waste my time with that.", whereas in the past I would have clicked on some of those videos. I became MUCH more selective in what to watch.

When you are used to not being stimulated, it's easy to become over-stimulated and realizing that. Whereas when I'm already surfing the web a lot it takes a lot of overstimulation and multitasking to get me to the point where I'm litterally fed up with all the constant information. It gets so bad, that I feel like "I can't take all that shit anymore" and need to take a break from the internet. Staying away from the internet for a while gives your brain a chance to re-sensitize itself. You'll be overwhelmed easier with information on the Internet. That's my theory. It's like staying a way from porn for a few weeks. You brain will go wild just from seeing an inch of skin.

I also want to mention that I also have never used and never will use TikTok. I also don't use my phone. I generally don't even have it with me. Unfortunately, I'm using reddit quite a bit. And I've been meditating every day for years. So, I know how to focus and just "do nothing" and still a few days of no Internet had a huge impact on me. I can't even imagine what it would be like for a "normal" person.</div>

Super fast feedback rewiring your brain chemistry.

"what's the explanation behind it?" 

The brain is not designed to have that much stimulus and stay the same. It has to reconfigure to make sense of so much information. And it can't, because there are millions of videos on YT, millions of posts on reddit, etc, and they are ever changing. It is like reading a book but the pages switch places within the chapters. It is total chaos.

The solution? Greyscale. No music. Turn off the phone. Turn off the wifi. Exercise, breathing. Cold showers. Writing with pen and paper. Erase the excessive bookmarks. Declutter the desktop screen. Eliminate useless apps. We are in a pit and we have to climb back out.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Not saying Zegler’s comments didn’t have any impact on the film’s box office or critical reception but how about make a better movie and maybe there will be more interest?

Gal Gadot’s performance was comedy, terrible writing, color grading/green screen looked like ass and the CGI dwarves looked fucking horrifying. 

Also why was the main love interest wearing a hoodie in a movie set in medieval times?

I would say Zegler’s performance was one of the better aspects of the movie (and she wasn’t good either)

edit: I straight hate live action Disney princess movies, they are just lazy corporate cash grabs but at least Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast was somewhat whimsical and fun? This movie was just drab and lifeless. Mulan was decent and haven’t seen The Little Mermaid yet</div>

But when an artist, or any creative, tells you how it took an exorbitant amount of time to finish a piece, it's most often because they simply never know when to be finished and move on to the next work.  If it would have taken a few weeks or months to get 90% of the way on this shot, and they used that, the world probably would not have been able to tell the difference had they not publicized their time spent.  As an art school graduate myself, I can tell you that for many artists the extra time can just add noise to an often already satisfactory piece.</div>

Miyazaki is all about the love for life in its infinite worlds of individual personalities, and in a crowd scene he couldn't but give the same amount of attention to every one. This is why I most definitely consider Miyazaki at the same level of De Sica, Kiarostami, and Wenders. Miyazaki work is one of the greatest contributions and testimony of human evolution.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Iain M Banks talked about this 25 years ago before his untimely death and it's still my favourite take on the matter. I'd love to know his thoughts on the modern world and state of AI.


So what," the Chelgrian asked, "is the point of me or anybody else writing a symphony, or anything else?"

The avatar raised its brows in surprise. "Well, for one thing, you do it, it's you who gets the feeling of achievement."

"Ignoring the subjective. What would be the point for those listening to it?"

"They'd know it was one of their own species, not a Mind, who created it."

"Ignoring that, too; suppose they weren't told it was by an AI, or didn't care."

"If they hadn't been told then the comparison isn't complete; information is being concealed. If they don't care, then they're unlike any group of humans I've ever encountered."

"But if you can—"

"Ziller, are concerned that Minds—AIs, if you like—can create, or even just appear to create, original works of art?"

"Frankly, when they're the sort of original works of art that I create, yes."

"Ziller, it doesn't matter. You have to think like a mountain climber."

"Oh, do I?"

"Yes. Some people take days, sweat buckets, endure pain and cold and risk injury and—in some cases—permanent death to achieve the summit of a mountain only to discover there a party of their peers freshly arrived by aircraft and enjoying a light picnic."

"If I was one of those climbers I'd be pretty damned annoyed."

"Well, it is considered rather impolite to land an aircraft on a summit which people are at that moment struggling up to the hard way, but it can and does happen. Good manners indicate that the picnic ought to be shared and that those who arrived by aircraft express awe and respect for the accomplishment of the climbers.

"The point, of course, is that the people who spent days and sweated buckets could also have taken an aircraft to the summit if all they'd wanted was to absorb the view. It is the struggle that they crave. The sense of achievement is produced by the route to and from the peak, not by the peak itself. It is just the fold between the pages." The avatar hesitated. It put its head a little to one side and narrowed its eyes. "How far do I have to take this analogy, Cr. Ziller?

That may never happen. It could also happen even if they achieve AGI if Open Source achieves it as well and companies don't see the value of shelling out for OpenAI subscriptions.

The internet saw a massive bubble pop but that didn't stop it becoming an incredibly disruptive technology. It just meant that people had incorrectly gambled on certain companies using it to become profitable.</div>

It took the companies themselves doing massive investment/share buy backs to increase the cost of the stocks to keep investors invested in the companies.

The problem this type of content has is monetization. Obviously subscription is the easiest way forward, but if you have a bunch of competitors offering free services then whats the point of buying the subs?

That's one of the reasons the Chinese LLM shook the market, why invest money into these companies if China is just going to come in and release it for free. Or worse the Chinese just steal it and give it to the public anyway.

No matter what the "experts" say, AGI isn't anywhere close to being done. and LLM will never hit AGI if they scale it up.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It is sensible when you think about things like... Tokenization. 

Text tokenization has been the most lucrative, because its information to byte ratio is incredibly high.

But there are so many more modalities that we want to have deeply embedded in the output/input of ever increasingly complex models. We just hit audio, and had images a bit before that, but in both of those cases we've constrained the flow of tokens because they are still too heavy for the sort of experience we need. Images are downsampled, for example. 

As we improve algorithms and increase compute, we can introduce more modalities and higher quality, but that immediately caps out our compute capacity. 

This will continue to happen for a while yet. 

That doesn't even go into the other reasons this happens, increased usage being a simple and clear one.</div>

I feel like 0-100 feels a little bit too much, but I do want to make progress instead of living my life as a slump. I think me avoiding to work on my life has become this new normal as if it's okay to take rest and just enjoy this life of pleasure over pain. But eventually majority of people get back to the grind. However I'm just living in the illusion of things will get better over time. I'm suffering mentally so I'm sure life will just hand everything I wished for and I don't need to put in...</div>

Normally I would just be happy about it since I’m an investor - but this sub has turned this shit into team sports. 

So given this is the FIRST EVER time that objectively Google is in the lead —- all categories as well as context price and speed —- it’s worthy of a post lmao

Cheap tricks like Ghibli memes stealing the spotlight may work in the short term but no one can deny the game has fundamentally changed.

We know GPT5 is imminent, o3 which they showed in December is slightly better than Gemini 2.5 and will probably be better than it was in December when it finally launches. Also it's Anthropics public policy to sit on models and only release them when the competition release a comparable model as they claim that they dont want to drive an AI capability race. Then there is R2 which given how good the new V3 is looks really promising</div>

I am treating it like I did with my cigarette addiction. I will leave it cold turkey on 1st April. Till the time I am using it as much as I can. I realised that this is another addiction in the guise of constant learning and overall the value I get from this website is not much when compared to the time I spend here. Need people to talk, reach out to friends. Need to learn about something, read books. There is no point in staying here now. So I will just leave this website.

                        <div class="comment-body">To my experience, there are always some activities that you'll find too captivating and difficult to resist. But the fact that you're unable to resist it at all and limit it to a healthy degree means there's something else that makes it a coping mechanism rather than rest &amp; pleasure.

Think about times when you're the least prone to go into this cycle - when does that happen? And also keep track of each time you actually feel the urge to surf. Then figure out - what was the thought or activity that led to an urge? Did you have some anxious thoughts? Or did you mean to start doing something specific, like hard project, or other unpleasant thing to do, and that's when you felt it?

Then you figure out why do you hate doing something to the point of not being able to, or why all of the sudden you feel anxious. I'd recommend talking with a therapist with this CBT, it's quite effective, I know that for a fact.

Reddit is not the actual problem. Even if you manage to suppress it without starting on fixing the real issue, something else will emerge.</div>

Don’t rinse out your mouth after brushing and spitting out the fluorinated toothpaste! My teeth were sensitive and my gums were receding. Then my dental hygienist told me not to rinse out my toothpaste with water. Just spit, wait 30 minutes to eat and drink. Voila. No more sensitivity. Don’t know if it could help anyone else, but my quality of life has significantly improved!</div>

Are other countries worse at brushing?

Edit: We also do not add fluor to our salt, beverages, food or other crazy stuff. You can buy toothpaste with fluor and dentists recommend that you do.

Edit edit: I looked into natural occuring fluor in drinking water and apparently 2/3 of the country have a high natural level of fluor in the drinking water, because of the underground composition. The 3 largest cities in the country are also placed within those regions. Those regions also have a high amount of calsium in the water and people outside this area have a much higher rate of Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth.</div>

Coincidence? Or is this a slow-boil frog situation, gradually acclimating the population to a future where private ownership is a luxury for the elite, and the rest of us are dependent on corporations and potentially governments for everything we need?

It feels like textbook behavioral conditioning on a mass...</div>

just look at computers. Without software getting slower doing more complex BS most might never really need they couldn't sell the need for faster chips. Without the need for faster chips not enough investment into new fabs/chip process which are extremely expensive for some reason.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's actually pretty limited compared to Dall-E. I've been trying to get it to reproduce stuff like a Pixar style, which Bing does with ease, and with bright saturated colors and deep blacks, but with Sora, everything is either photorealistic, or Ghibli, but even the photorealisitc stuff isn't, in that the colors are very muted and you don't get deep blacks. I have seen some good results if people post-process in photoshop to correct the tone though.

I wonder if something in their rule set is affecting the quality of the images. They're much more restrictive than Bing was too. Bing would happily make a Pokemon even if it got it wrong most of the time, but ChatGPT and Sora simply refuse, even if you're just trying to get it to make an image of a pokemon more detailed. It figures out what it is and refuses.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Tbf I’ve heard Joe in podcasts defend the polio vaccine. I forget which right winger he was talking to where he was saying how horrifying the idea of living in an iron lung was.

I mention that because the REAL sleight of hand his current guests employ is to say the Covid vax actually ISNT a vaccine and it’s the MRNA part that is dangerous and he’s only being labelled an anti-vaxxer because everyone decided to call the Covid vaccine a “vaccine” as a marketing tool. I remember he went into detail on this with Bret Weinstein last summer.

Granted, his views change with his guests so it’s also possible he’s full anti-vax by now but it would be news to me.</div>

This is what makes conspiracy theories so difficult to debunk - in the conspiracy theorists mind their side is pure and anyone who disagrees is a pedophile.  It makes it difficult to have any sort of discussion</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/this_be_ben:

---

Official submission statement for this post about the link to the video: Many years ago i found this video that was then removed and re uploaded by another Youtube proving all record of the Mage brazil UfO invasion has been wiped from the internet. US military involvement,  dog  fights etc. Just a few months ago couldnt find anything on Google but now you can. Smells like controlled disclosure.  I think its good for peoople to download or screen record it just in case it gets removed again. I hope this submission statement has enough characters. My original submission statement had 325 character way above 150 threshold so this one now has 649

People were talking about a crash and a heavy military presence in a wooded part of Brazil. I woke up the next day and saw absolutely no one talking about it, no posts or anything. It was as if it never happened. They are capable of completely scrubbing anything. Ive been on this sub several times when there is a heavy influx of posts relating to a mass sighting that is currently happening, and then you go to sleep and wake up the next day and see nothing about it anymore. This alone has always been a form of proof to me that there is a reason we never see the compelling shit.</div>

Of everything I saw, the strangest thing was when I saw on flight radar 3 American helicopters flying over the area. Worse than that, I also saw an American cargo plane arriving at the airport closest to the area. In addition, there was a strong military presence in the area and some individuals tried to use drones, but they were all shot down.</div>
