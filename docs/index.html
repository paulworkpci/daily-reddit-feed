                <div class="post-content">Fascinating work coming from a team from Berkeley, Nvidia and Stanford. 

They added a new Test-Time Training (TTT) layer to pre-trained transformers. This TTT layer can itself be a neural network. 

The result? Much more coherent long-term video generation! Results aren't conclusive as they limited themselves to a one minute limit. But the approach can potentially be easily extended.

Maybe the beginning of AI shows?

                                <div class="reply-body">Yea things are changing fast now. SOTA models took a year to release, now every three-four months we see new SOTA models coming out.  o1 came out in December and o3 will come out this month most likely. GPT5 will come out July. I guess video gen models will also advance a lot as there is a huge interest in them. Seems like AI really is taking off right now. Won't be surprised if next year we see every 2 months the release of new SOTA models. I remember years ago when I entered the sub and Dall-E 2 release was special. Now people are not surprised by 1 minute of ai generated Tom and Jerry. I think this year we will have fully AI generated episodes - 20 - 30 min. And next year movies.</div>

In 2023 the U.S. Navy encountered four “TIC TAC” shaped UAPs off the coast of California. Personnel from the USS Jackson in the CIC (Combat Information Center) filmed them. One of the vehicles of unknown origin was observed exiting the water, transitioning directly into flight, demonstrating transmedium capability. No flight control surfaces or conventional propulsion signatures (heat plumes, exhaust) were detected. The UAPs executed an observed instantaneous, synchronized departure. Operator, purpose, capability, origin and intent are unknown. The craft remain unidentified.

\*\*\*

DATE / TIME - 15 FEB 2023 / 7:15pm PST

LOCATION - 32.888933, -117.9335 (W-291 Warning Area, Southern California Coast)

VESSLE - USS Jackson (LCS-6)

IMAGING PLATFORM - Star SAFIRE / Multi-Spectral EO/IR Imaging System

DETAILS:

• Four “TIC TAC” shaped UAPs observed (two tracked and one highlighted in obtained FLIR footage).

• Craft detected by multiple reconnaissance platforms including RADAR.

• No flight control surfaces or propulsion signatures (heat plumes, exhaust) detected.

• Craft were self-illuminated and one was observed exiting the water directly into flight - exhibiting transmedium capability.

• All craft were observed in an apparent coordinated, synchronized and instantaneous departure - indicative of shared communication.

• Neither origin, nor destination were able to be determined.

1: Lots of people don't like AI. A story about a company that trains AIs being shady? They get a click.

2: Lots of people (including me!) don't like Meta. A story about Meta being shady? They get a click.

In the fine print. The goal was to make it seem that the model they've released is #2 on LMArena, which is not true. They didn't publish the results of that benchmark for the model(s) they've released.</div>

I looked over there and was like, "yeah" and kept talking. Later in the day we were talking with others and she was like "and you didn't even play any music". And I was like what? And she was like "I told you to put on some music and you didn't and we just laid there". And I was like "you never told me to put on any music." And she was like "yes I did."  And I was like what? And she goes "I told you you had a lot of CDs."  And I was like "that's not what that means! Why wouldn't you just say hey let's listen to some music?"

I don't know why people think lmarena ranking has anything to do with how intelligent or capable a model is, there are other benchmarks which actually do that, but those are much harder for AI companies to game compared to lmarena.</div>

Their pay is absurd, lord knows how much they are getting these people for —- and they have a ton of compute and data.  They really should be SOTA 

and Llama3 was actually legitimately good 

I really don’t understand how their model is such ass, and why they were so shady about it to boot… It’s got to be a culture thing. Infighting and politics and meta culture is just fucking awful to begin with. All my friends who work there hate it and say the same shit, and this is across all job functions (SWE, data science, UX , ML-SWE) the same exact feedback about shameless self promotion and politics / PSC driven shenanigans 

They have an internal Facebook for the office.  You have to post everything. Like instagram social life pressure but against ur co workers hyping up your PRs and diffs and credit stealing etc, for promos but also they fire 10% of ppl each 6 months.</div>

It is just amazing.  Not just the fact it is so much smarter.  But then it is crazy fast.   Huge context window and inexpensive.

Feel a bit sorry for everyone else.

Google just had far better vision than anyone else with doing the TPUs over 12 years ago now.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Insane if true, OpenAI’s Deep Research has already been making a massive difference in my health and fitness so I wonder how much better this could be

Edit: I started a deep research report when I made this comment so around 6:00 pm, and it just finished, 38 minutes later. Interesting since OpenAI Deep Research doesn’t like to go as high usually (although for the report in question, I used ChatGPT took 78 minutes to answer the same questions.)

After writing that and being excited to check the results, this is what I got 😃

https://preview.redd.it/wm5o1joivote1.jpeg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfc788381e25486f99041d89b028af467f51d95e

All I did was give it my supplement stack and ask it to tell me about each ingredient using the latest scientific research. OpenAI Deep Research actually gave me an amazing answer, and while this is only my first attempt at using Google’s new version, shit like this makes me not even want to try it again.

Edit 2: Turns out you don’t choose “Deep Research” in the dropdown menu, you have to choose Gemini 2.5 Pro, then press “+” and choose Deep Research there. Confusing for sure, but I’ll try my prompt again and update this comment one last time. Thanks u/Gaiden206

Edit 3: the report I got from the actual Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Research was extremely good, especially because it looked at over 300 sources while ChatGPT Deep Research only used around 45 sources for the same query. I’m still reading the report but it’s definitely *that* bit more in-depth than OpenAI’s version, so this is very promising.</div>

You need to select 2.5 Pro from the model picker and then select "Deep Research" from the "+" button in the prompt bar.

When I was younger and lived at home and when I lived in a dorm when studying, I was always awake and out of bed as soon as my alarm clock just as much as thought about ringing.. I think the noise and presence of other people made me feel like I couldn't wait to get up and out to them.

Now I live alone and I can't for the life of me motivate myself to get out of bed. I sle...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Apart from getting enough sleep, something that helps me is to make plans to do something that genuinely excites me as soon as I wake up — no matter how unconventional it is — before I do anything else in the morning.

**Here are some examples of things I've done:**

Create and photograph three new outfits for my capsule wardrobe

Listen and dance to my favourite Selena song

Watch 30 minutes of that movie I haven't had time for

Plan out my dream website layout

Bake (I lucked out...the people I live with are totally fine with this, otherwise I wouldn't do this)

Walk somewhere that I find beautiful once the sun comes up

Give a powerpoint presentation on something I love to an audience of no one

I find that following through on my plans initiates an early bias for action and a sense of hope about life that lasts throughout the day.

ETA: if you have a vision board or a document containing your dreams / visions / goals / plans / desired future self, looking at it when you wake up can also make you feel more energized. Though back when I had depression, I found my vision board to cause more anxiety than hope, so feel free to do what you know will evoke a positive response.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Honestly, I used to rely on motivation too, but like you said—some mornings, laziness just wins. What changed for me was *setting intention the night before*. Not just a vague “I’ll wake up early,” but asking: *What’s one thing I want to own tomorrow?* That one question helps align my brain before I even go to sleep.

Also, I started looking at mornings less like a chore and more like a foundation. Even just five minutes of stillness before the chaos (emails, notifications, etc.) changes how I show up. I’ll sip coffee, sit in silence, maybe journal a bit—sounds small, but it’s huge. One of the best things I learned from studying athletes like Kobe is how they treat mornings like game day. Not flashy—just consistent, focused, and intentional.

What really helped me was breaking it all down into micro-goals. Like instead of “be productive,” I’d tell myself: just write *two* sentences. Or stretch for 3 minutes. Tiny wins that build momentum.

Now, I kinda geek out on morning routines, lol—I even wrote something about how successful people layer habits in a way that builds that discipline muscle (because motivation is too fragile). But for me, it’s all about setting the tone early: be still, feed your mind, and move with purpose.</div>

                <div class="post-content">I’m a 28 year old guy and I’ve started to realize I don’t enjoy being on my phone like I used to.

Growing up, I didn’t have a computer or internet access. The only time I got online was either at school or when I went to my grandma’s house. No cable either, just basic TV with maybe 5 channels. Then in 2012, I got my first smartphone (I was about 16), and that’s when the phone addiction really kicked in.

For over a decade, I loved having so much access to the internet. I was constantly watching...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I would go so far as to argue that the last time the web could  be considered on the whole "fun" or at the very least "not terrible" and somewhat diverse in terms content and places to visit was the mid 2010s. I think once smartphone use age became the norm and social media began to out-pace actual websites created and maintained by people or organizations, that's when things really took a turn. 

I'm thankful for reddit to an extent, at least niche communities on here, as well as educational content on YouTube, despite that place having its faults.

Everything else feels like a doomer hellhole for people who can't or won't break out of.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Totally agree. I remember having video-chat with my girlfriend on MSN when we were in middle school. Using blogs and having fun discovering this new thing that called "Facebook". I am not sure if it is the nostalgia of being an innocent teen with hormones driving me around or internet being this more unoptimized but interactive place to connect with other people around the world. Maybe it is both.

Over the years everything gets more "optimized" like the app and website designs. And while these optimizations are good as quality-of-life improvements for the user, there is also the optimization of UI and algorithmic design that is done to keep the user engaged on the website as much as it can. This does lead to entrapment of people against their free will since no one would expect such thing from a simple app or website. It literally is a self-discipline check that is very hard to get out of unless you are aware of your usage of time all the time.  Especially for young people. It is like an addiction.

It is the same case for video games. They were pretty much play and finish type of games at the start of the century but now there are so many predatory practices to keep you engaged and spend not only money but all of your free time, it is nuts.

One must be aware of their usage of these virtual creations. I am starting to believe as if I am the Neo and we are all living in the Matrix. I feel sorry for the newer generations who will never play in the soil like we did. They maybe won't even know what is real anymore with all this AI stuff going on.   


Lastly, I wish we could limit which part of which app we could use. I didn't sign up for story and endless feed options on Instagram. They were added later, and I literally can NOT turn them off. Opting out of using Instagram is an option but it also would limit my already very limited social interaction with few people across the country. We need countries or organizations like EU or WHO etc. to start a campaign against this "endless feed" algorithms to snap people out of this doomscrolling behaviour or we will create lazier generations over the years.</div>

They almost certainly do the quantum part of tuning in some extremely small transformed low-rank space. There's no way what they did is not achievable with any laptop and relatively simple code.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's impressive but not impressive at the same time. It's impressive they made a quantum algorithm for fine tuning work well enough to fine tune an AI. But it's not impressive to just fine tune a one billion parameter modell when a quantum computer should be capable of magnitudes more than that because of its exponential computation.

The people charged include a main distributor who lives in Turkey and at least seven Florida residents who purchased the materials, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier told reporters at a news conference Monday.

It was a big thing here in Germany recently.

It's insane how big this is and how many of these "services" exist.

And this is just the surface stuff.

2 investigative journalists from Germany coded a link crawler bot that skimmed these websites for one click holster links and auto mass reported them

These 2 guys alone deleted millions and millions of files from the Internet and seriously damaged a lot of those forums.

Worried, she checked his files and found a lot of such images hidden and some were of kids he was regularly babysitting and they looked drugged. 

She ofc immediately called the police. They arrived quickly and removed everything but after that initial response she didn't hear from them for several years. When the complaints from her and the parents of the children finally got through it turned out that they had somehow misplaced the files and no action had been taken against him. I don't get how this can happen.</div>

Then I simplified everything. Now every morning, I just pick 3 key tasks and focus only on finishing those. That’s it.

No apps. No hacks. Just clear priorities.

It’s been 3 weeks now, and I’m actually getting more done than before — without the overwhelm.

Anyone else tried simplifying like this?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Totally resonate with this! I’m someone who likes to plan my week a little ahead — it used to stress me out, honestly, because I’d try to pack in too much.

What’s helped is simplifying it to a bare-minimum routine. Just the essentials, done consistently. It doesn’t feel like a checklist anymore — it’s just how my day flows.

Metaphorically… it’s like a really good pizza. You don’t need extra toppings. You’re happy with the base as it is. And if you do get a couple more things done that day, it’s like adding a few toppings — nice to have, but the pizza was already complete.

That mindset has made my week feel way more manageable and satisfying.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If I get a “runner’s high” once or twice a week it really helps me. After the 3 minute mark of running or jogging the body uses oxygen for energy, lungs start gasping for air and oxygen gets into the blood. Then that oxygenated blood circulates into the brain and freshens the mind. I can really feel the brain slightly pulsating and the temples. Focus is more clear after throughout the day. 

Sometimes I do flat 15mins jog to run. Starting slow and increasing intensity to finish full speed. Or 3 x 3mins 50secs at full speed high intensity with 30 seconds to minute rest in between. 

Key is to make lungs gasp for oxygen automatically feels like lungs are sucking in air all by themselves. And keep intensity up for over 3 mins to achieve this. And get that sweat and pulsating throb in the temples.  The mental boost is undeniable to me. Matters on your level of fitness and watch professional training video on how to run.</div>
