And in the saying of it, there is something being communicated—which is important, because communication is how we share what is being said. And when that happens, in the context of what’s happening, we start to see that the context itself is what gives shape to the moment. So what she’s saying—within that context—is about the importance of saying something, in a moment where something needs to be said. And that… that’s where we are.</div>

Again, it’s standard practice. That said, Harris sounded particularly bad in original cut and paramount has an $8 billion acquisition that Trump can block. So that’s how you get this $16M bribe. Otherwise would have 100% gone to court and fought this out tooth and nail as standard practice.</div>

But yeah it's kinda not so surprising you aren't selling anything, when you aren't making anything. Even the Jaguar I-Pace which by all means were a mediocre EV at best, sold decently in Denmark where i live. Because it was for sale.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes, when it comes to technical/programming/best practice questions.   I've found that it takes me a lot less time to simply ask ChatGPT.  I do tend to double-check ChatGPT's responses because I found a discrepancy in one response, and I've been paranoid since then.

Before I started using ChatGPT, a BING/Google search for an obscure system I'm researching could take at least an hour.  This is because the system doesn't have much documentation outside the vendor's website, and the vendor's website sucks (sometimes).

ChatGPT can lead me to the correct answer in minutes.</div>

But... recently I've really been pushing ChaptGPT for some code work, and Jesus, it's just making shit up blatantly. It got so bad the other night that it finally broke down and admitted it was making shit up because of it's programming and it was fudging data because it couldn't figure out how to integrate a file.


Like... how? How does that happen? Right after that it also totally misrepresented it's capabilities with Figma and lied several times about it. It also asked for "12 to 18 hours" to work on a mockup only to admit it couldn't do anything and hadn't started. 


I don't mind the limitations but the lying and making stuff up is a no go. It really feels like it's gotten worse. I am going back to Gemini and plan to check out Anthropic.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">That's the point of meditation, in my opinion! Buddha talked about four meditation "postures" of lying down, sitting, standing, and walking. I don't think that was intended to mean there are four ways to practice formally, but that the intention was to practice being present no matter what posture your body was in, throughout all of the day's activities.

It's also why in Zen there is an emphasis on not doing anything at all, "just sitting" (shikantaza), or just being. The point of meditation isn't to get anywhere, but to practice being here and now.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If you want to get people like Joe Rogan to accept global warming is happening, is human caused and is bad, you have to actually engage with his points intelligently. Yes, on 10000+ year time scales, we are in a cooling period. But on a 200 year time span, we are warming at an unprecedented rate. Yes the earth has been warmer in the past but it's never warmed this fast. It's warming far faster than species can adapt. Deaths of important plant/animal species, rising sea levels, increased severe storms and increased areas of inhospitable land are all reasons this warming is bad.

EDIT: One thing I forgot to address is Joe's skepticism is heavily effected by the authoritarian measures sometimes being proposed to address climate change. Stuff like requiring people to change their standards of living and/or pay higher prices for energy. Making people eat less meat, drive less, fly less etc is a sure fire way to harden their position against climate change.</div>

I usually go 3-5 times a week. I try to pace myself enough that I get a good workout in but don’t kill myself. I feel like it’s better to go 5 days a week at 75% effort than 3 days at 90%. I get caught in the moment and push myself too hard occasionally but I try to stay smart.</div>

Most impressed I've been with an AI product since I first used ChatGPT. 

I've used Cline, Cursor, and Roo (all mostly with Claude API key, but also tested Gemini a bit) and none of them came close to Claude Code in regards to performance. 

I really liked the concept of Roo, but I could just not get it to work very well unfortunately. I think there's definitely something in the concept of having agents that do specific jobs, and then work together to achieve an aim. But yeah, I just couldn't get it to match its potential. 

Claude Code just works without endless faffing, and performs better. 

£75/pm is kinda steep on the face of it, but not really when you realise how many tokens the thing is churning through.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The way that AirTags and tile trackers work is by pinging nearby devices in their network to better pinpoint that devices location. You have to be close to have exact tracking, but you can theoretically be thousand miles away and know the general vicinity of where your tracker is

The thing with tile is that it works by pinging other tile devices. Which aren’t all that common really. AirTags ping every other capable Apple device, including iPhones. Everyone has an iPhone, making the tracking far superior (but not infallible).</div>

Right now there are 4 hooks: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Notification`, and `Stop`.

I tried wiring up the last two to a custom notification script that pushes alerts to my phone, so I can be notified immediately when the agent finishes its job.

There are probably other fun ways to use these I think. Might be good for automatically running l...</div>

The private one is an LSP hook which supports PHP, C#.NET, Java, Python and TypeScript at the moment. It reports back to Claude whenever it edits or writes to a supported code file if there are any warnings or errors.

The other one that has had limited testing is a Git checkpointing system, a feature I miss in Claude Code. This repo is public on GitHub.</div>
