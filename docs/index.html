Estimates range from just over $1B to $2B.

                                <div class="reply-body">maybe its not 5 million but definitely cheaper than the usual way. if you had read the paper, the approach to use RL makes a lot of sense and cheaper than a pure training on massive corpus of text

anyway, the model si there for you to download (all 671 billion parameters). Wake me when OpenAI or Grok decides to release in such a manner too.

Fact is, the US is releasing less and less academic papers on the topic and a massive amount of papers are being released by the chinese. Not defending the chinese but its a bit more than just "they are not spending enough money" fallacy.

Anyway, nothing stopping the other companies to copy the same methods and benefit from the method. If its true, then everyone benefits. if its false, we'll find out sooner or later.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah I find it absolutely wild that people are running around shouting about the $6 million figure, without even giving it a shred of critical thought. Innumeracy is alive and well I guess. People do not understand numbers, especially at scale.

There were 100 contributors to the DeepSeek R1 paper alone - you mean to tell me these top notch AI scientists are all making under 60k? Or let’s say this breakthrough took 6 months instead of a full year- that would mean all of the scientists are making less than 120k each?

H100 GPUs alone cost $40k a pop, and that’s only if you have easy access to them. And you can’t just do this kind of training on one, you need at a minimum hundreds of them.

It was also made very clear in the paper that they had gone through several training runs before finding the right RL configuration, paired with the right supervised fine-tuning process (to fix some of its language issues). It wasn’t a one-shot thing.

                <div class="post-content">Okay so I have a horrible phone addiction and it's making me not be productive. I have so many passions and things I am interested in doing, but it's just this phone is just so easy to grab and watch stuff on. I hate the fact that it's making me into this lazy unproductive person, bc I could be so much more. Also doesn't help that it has gotten worse since I moved into my own apartment. 

I don't ofc want to get rid of it since I need it for calls etc, but this feels so hard to break out of.

The amount of people who I knew in the military or the federal government that also don’t know shit about fuck is significantly higher than the general public thinks.

This community is entering a slippery slope- Mantis Beings? Psychic UAP summoning? Angels?

Isn't that the whole point? That the truth of the situation is known by a very small number of people and the goal is to get it out to the masses? I don't think the general public believes that a significant number of people in the military or federal government knows anything. Quite the opposite. Again, that's the whole thrust of the UAP issue, getting the information out of the hands of a very few individuals and out to the people.</div>

If anybody in government or military is told anything UAP related, or is working on anything UAP related, it's going to be a very very small few at positions somehow even more qualified than mine.</div>

They never explicitly said he was, but watch the beginning of that News Nation piece again. They insinuate and let you think he was a helo pilot for tier 1 clandestine ops. 

They’re exploiting what is known as an appeal to authority logical fallacy and they knew what they were doing with that piece. Barber was an E-3 enlisted mechanic and closer to what OP is talking about (not knowing shit) than being in some ultra elite tiny circle of people in the know, as you alluded to.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">this is actually quite true. I would say working/laboring/doing chores are "traditional human activities". In the pre-internet era, it is a must-do thing. It's just that as tech evolves we are gradually evolving too as human beings and things that were once seen "necessary" may no longer be "necessary", and things that were once seen "valuable" becomes "invaluable". Just like how primates tens of thousands of years ago must sharpen their rocks by the time they wake up everyday to create a spear so they would be able to prey on animals (which was the "must-do" at their times), but now no human beings would sharpen any rocks for survival, instead they put on shirts and bowties to go working. Times change, traditions change, human activities also change follow along that.</div>

Productivity is most high when people are intrinsically interested in their work and you can actually design jobs to make otherwise drudgery feel much more enjoyable and meaningful. The important thing to apply to your case, though, may be to recognize that all people need to rest and recover... No matter how enjoyable or arduous the productive work may feel. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">It's kinda hilarious that so many people genuinely consider deepseek thieves who stole from OpenAI, without any background knowledge. Just because these guys are Chinese. 

How about the fact that OpenAI built its systems on 1. open-source Google tech; and 2. digital information of the *entire world's internet*? Do you think OpenAI intend to share any of their profits with the hundreds of millions of people whose information they used?

I could say that none of the two is better than the other, but that would be a lie. Because DeepSeek didn't just take. They gave all the fruits of their labor back to the community. While OpenAI take and have no plans to give back.</div>

There’s plenty of bad faith actors in the influencer movement. The right wing knows the only way capitlaism can survive any longer without transitioning to socialism is for consolidation of power to Bourgeois Class and the Republican Party.

Why do you think Marc Andreessen flip flopped on AGI over night? The second an open source model caught up to corporate, he went from pretending to be libertarian to *we have to ban AGI right now!*

These people are scum fucks, always have been.</div>

There's a big group of AI watchers who are fans of open source (myself being one), and that's on Twitter too it's the same thing everywhere, this is a big win for open source. That's why everybody's talking about it. It will stop the moment something new comes out and drowns all the other news out, which will probably be next week because Gemini 2 pro is rumored to release.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I would imagine a good chunk of this will go towards strengthening SMIC and other domestic production. That's what I take from things like "self-reliance" and "computing power"

I'd imagine a lot of this will also go towards actual AI development but China's geopolitical obstacles are probably seen as how much they depend on other countries to get what they need. One of the unintended (but foreseeable) consequences of denying nvidia chips and ASML equipment.

So you're likely to see this result in more China pulling away from Western dependency than some new awesome thing coming out of China that wasn't already probably going to come.</div>

Do you really trust the future in the hands of Ellison, Musk, Trump, Altman, Pichai, Sadella, Bezos, Zuckerberg etc?

Have you seen this? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQqQtgRdjZU&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQqQtgRdjZU&amp;t=1s)

How can you watch this then say "Yay more AI! More accelerationism! Bring it to us faster!"?

Again, do you really trust these guys?

I'm super curious to get your perspective.</div>

I was preparing everything and my sweet cat jumped up next to me. Snuggled against me. Purred so loudly and just stared into my eyes with the deepest love in his gaze at me. And I realized I didn’t want to leave him and I went and got some mental health help at a crisis center. 

He’s 14 now and he gets all the cuddles and pets and treats as is healthy.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hi everyone !  

For those who no longer entertain themselves with their devices, how do you pass the time during long travel hours (like extended train rides or flights)? 

When commuting, I usually just read or listen to music, but for longer trips I find that music and books aren’t quite enough to keep me entertained.

I’d love to hear your suggestions! :)</div>

That post on 4chan, by a prison guard supposedly, quantifiably posted before the news broke the story from any outlet. If someone has done a deeper dive on that, maybe it didn’t beat all the news but I’ve never found an earlier example. Obviously it could be disinformation, too.

Interesting nonetheless. 

I don’t think it makes sense to assume he killed himself. He either had more work to do or was being rewarded for all the power he helped to consolidate.</div>

It's like Maxwell, she had to pay the courts and the media to create false information, people believe that she is still in prison. She just changed the location of her islands, Trump is friends with Epstein, he will never release his list or maybe.

                        <div class="comment-body">John McAfee’s death was not natural. This is one of the reason he was killed.   
  
Once you try to expose them, they hey take you down.

John McAfee shared many truths over the years. Instead of listening people called him crazy, paranoid.  
  
Now he's dead, killed, most likely for sharing said truths and still no one is listening. 

**John McAfee, in what ended up being one of his last messages:**  
  
"Some of you may be living an existence of dissatisfaction... of emptiness... of longing."  
  
"This sense of longing... is really your loss of freedom. And it is freedom for which you yearn."  
  
"And you have none in this government. A government... which started out with the people being free and the government being our servants. It has become the government is free... and it's the people that are the servants."   
  
"You have woken up to your reality. That is what you are feeling."  
  
"Wake up a bit more and do something about it."</div>

He used his wealth to manipulate and extort people in Belize for his own benefit, including sexual relationships with minors and the hiring of convicted criminals to intimidate opposition to his moves to control the area he moved to. Then fled and avoided trial to the murder he was accused of, in which there was great evidence. This was recorded and documented by himself personally. It’s all out there to see. RIP?

The following submission statement was provided by /u/PositiveSong2293:

---

In an exclusive interview published earlier by NewsNation, Lieutenant Colonel John Blitch, a former Green Beret and nuclear officer, stated that he believes in the claims made by UFO whistleblower Jake Barber.


During the conversation, Blitch shared his experiences with anomalous activities and discussed Barber's new allegations about a secret UFO recovery program conducted by the government.


Lieutenant Colonel John Blitch is a retired military officer, cognitive psychologist, and senior researcher at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, specializing in cognitive psychology and neuroscience.


Throughout his military career, Blitch served in special operations and hostage rescue missions. After retiring from DARPA in 2002, he founded Blitz Solutions Inc. and established two non-profit organizations: CRASAR, responsible for the first robot-assisted humanitarian response after the September 11, 2001 attacks, and ARACAR, which provided support during the Hurricane Katrina response in 2005.


About the conversation with the alien:👽 


the being explained to him the body is just a machine that houses the soul and they can’t steal his soul or consciousness and we’re trying to help him 


Dr. Blitch -“a tall seven-ish foot praying mantis looking, being was upset with me. And was Chastising me”


“ I was terrified, frozen, paralyzed to the bed. And he, I got a male presence, vibe, from this being and is just looking at me very intently and explained to me, look, this body that you got, it is just a soul housing group. It's a brain housing group. It is just a machine that your soul occupies for this lifetime. And so, yeah, we're gonna mess with it. We're gonna get up under the hood and we're gonna adjust the carburetor. Right? I had just dated myself there. You know, we, we may swap a couple of parts out, but we can't steal you, we can't steal your soul, we can't steal your consciousness. So quit screaming and writhing around and let us do our fricking job. And it's the, it's, it's like the equivalent of a surgeon telling the patient, stop squiggling, just like the veterinarian to my, my laboratory retriever.” And the whole time he is conveying to me, see, we can't get your soul. We could do a lot of damage to your body if we want to. We don't, we're trying to help you, but this is how bad it could get. So stop squiggling it around and let us get this done.”

They can get complicated too, I once hallucinated my room was an aircraft hanger. When people say they experienced something alien related during sleep I’m immediately skeptical. I can see how someone could treat a once off of one of these kinds of sleep experiences as profound but when they happen to you all the time it becomes pretty obvious it’s just your brain misfiring. I certainly don’t think I was really inside an aircraft hanger, because I’ve hallucinated a million other things in the middle of the night before.</div>

Made all driver side airbags go off and basically fucked everything. The driver was insured by someone in Washington state, called insurance, and they said we needed to call someone in our state/insurance. But our insurance said they wouldn’t handle it and that it needed to go through their stuff in Washington. Eventually we just stopped trying because it was just round and round. But still never resolved in and the car has been at the place it got towed to ever since. I’ve tried finding a lawyer for it every couple months for the last 2 years. But nothing ever seems to work at resolving it.</div>

Apparently the only recourse for that is to sue the at-fault driver (or their insurance company if they have one) and they didn't think the headache was worth it 

This wasn't my accident or claim so I didn't get all the details. There's probably something I'm missing that let them deny it in the first place, but my point is that even when the law is on your side, the insurance company will still do their best to pay as little as possible.</div>

There's a hell of a lot of strong psychological pressure on people who are active in a programming sub to reject AI.

Don't blame them, don't berate them, let time be the judge of who is right and who is wrong.

For what it's worth, this sub also creates delusion in the opposite direction due to confirmation bias and group polarisation. As a community, we're probably a little too optimistic about AI in the short-term.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">That depends very much on your timeline to say it's "about to be worthless". And currently, factually speaking, we aren't anywhere near close to that. No current model or system is consistent enough where it can actually reliable do "work" unsupervised, even if this work were 100% just coding. Anyone talking about "firing developers as they're no longer needed", as of 2025, is poorly informed at best, delusional at worst, or with a vested interest in making the public believe that.

No currently known products, planned or otherwise, will change that situation. It's definitely not o3, nor claude's next update, nor anyone else, I guarantee you that. Some of you simply are severely underestimating how much and how well would a model have to perform to truly be able to consistently replace even intern level jobs. We need much better agents, much better models, much better integration between systems and much, much, MUCH better time and cost benefit for that to begin making a dent on the market.

That doesn't mean I don't think it's not going to improve, it will, but I do think a sentence such as "programming careers are about to be worthless" are beyond overrepresenting the current situation and what's actually feasible in the short to mid term</div>

His tweets are proof that you can be very smart at something, yet incredibly stupid and cringe at everything else

Well - most researchers in general at most of these top labs are actually all pretty mid tbh. It's really a handful that are truly good and not doing the same things that any competent STEM educated researcher could do after a few months of exposure to AI. That and sheer numbers of them exploring different ideas and sheer compute/money is what's brought us to where we are today - it would be a mistake to think it's because AI researchers at top labs have been outstandingly skilled as a whole.

If you have 10k developers at $250k per year, that's $2.5b burn rate on labor. Save 20% with LLM's and you lop off $500MM.

How could somebody possibly believe we could accommodate millions of new CS graduates every year when perhaps about a few 100ks retire yearly ?

Now add freaking AI to the equation, and CS is doomed. I'm a software engineer and i see myself as having about 3 years of software left. A big problem is that many software engineers don't see what's coming for what it is, and believe they still have decades ahead of them.
