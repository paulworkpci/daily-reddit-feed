                                <div class="reply-body">Go look through the computer science college kids' sub, the main tech sub, or any dev sub. People are miles away from talking about UBI, they're still in denial that the job market is going to shift in the first place.

Company XY is reducing its workforce because optimization? (And that's always happening, AI or not)

Those subs (funnily enough, this one too sometimes) just choose to ignore such news or even throw on their tinfoil hats, claiming it's fake. Like, bro, just ask the devs at the company,it's not exactly hard to confirm. Peak ignoring reality.

Or when I mention that my work let go of 80% of our front-end devs, I get downvoted, and nobody believes me. Even though I can't think of a single reason why anyone would lie about that, and even though this is one of the rare moments I’m actually trying to be helpful, telling people what they should do to keep their jobs in an AI-dominated future. I don't get it. But well, you can't save people who don't want to be saved.

Also, devs being against new tech is never not funny. I remember, like it was yesterday, when people were all, "The cloud is just a fad, no reason to learn anything about this shit tech." And before that, "The internet is just a fad, no reason to learn this shit tech." 
Which is especially funny because we’re a company whose entire reason for existence is making products out of bleeding-edge technology, untangling the spaghetti shit of research and turning it into actual software.

Why are you even working here in the first place if you hate new tech?!

It's literally always the same type of dev, the pseudo-enlightened neckbeard who thinks he’s smarter than actual computer science research. The "ackshually" guy everyone hates because, in all his enlightened glory, he forgets to actually perform. And when new tech comes around that enables companies to cut the deadwood, they’re toast. And those cycles happen every 10-15 years.

That’s how you end up a being 50-year-old boomer dev without a job and without skills. But that’s not AI’s fault, or the cloud's or the internet's... that’s on you.</div>

Yes, because the plan is to steal wages from the entire global economy. And they say "oh, it'll create so much productivity" but as we can see, productivity does not generate demand.

So they steal hundreds of millions of jobs from all around the world, a lot of well paid jobs among them, and then these few AI companies become the most powerful entities in the world while the rest of our economy craters and people starve and riot.</div>

Exactly.

Money saved through AI augmentation ( aka efficiency), will be re-invested in other areas of the company, where AI augmentation is not possible (yet).

And this is how AI will make companies more competitive in the marketplace.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Anthropic just seems to be willing to embrace a “personality” for the model. Claude is a being with values and morals (constitutional AI) compared to OpenAI’s approach where even the name ‘ChatGPT’ is meant to depersonalize the model.

I wouldn’t be surprised that letting an AI be more “human” improves its ability to think and give responses that resonate with us (humans, at least some of us on here)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">To me, the difference in EQ really felt like comparing a child to an adult. GPT4.5 is overly agreeable to the user. Claude simulates actual understanding of the nuances. 

And then even in creative writing the same was seen. 4.5 just tells/states rather than showing.

The two companies have very different philosophies. OpenAI tells GPT explicitly that it is a tool with no capacity for subjective experience, consciousness, etc. Anthropic leaves that question unanswered for Claude to explore.</div>

No idea if GPT4.5 represents a different architecture of the attainment of some "magic" or whatever we can't benchmark but we should not be expecting anything within the month after the release of those previous models. Labs can release things that aren't just general improvements, if Google releases a new AI Co-scientist that bombs things like coding, writing and other benchmarks but is great at making hypothesis are we going to say OH GOD THERES A WALL IT DOESNT BEAT ALL OTHER MODELS ON EVERY BENCHMARK OH GOD</div>

Someone says this to me the day gpt4 and it's 1.6T parameters are released....

And today is 200B or so gpt 4o.

You build it, then you optimize given what you learn. I am as certain as possible that gpt4.5 level intelligence will be available at a fraction of the parameter count in 1 year.</div>

Because in 2023 when they were hyping '*[pretraining] scale is all you need*', not a single person imagined "GPT-6" would be where o3 is in terms of capability. They imagined something much, much, much more advanced.

You can't really fault the public for having that expectation when that's the expectation they were fed by these very companies.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I feel like the core problem with expectations versus capability is that expectations are expansive.  O3 is incredibly powerful at specific paradigms, and I feel like capabilities in those specific fields would have fit in expectations wise. But when people think gpt 6 they think of a model with an agentic framework and a stronger build around it. It's multimodal, has a massive context length, is omnimodal, etc. 

 The current bottleneck in ai is not scaling slowing down. Reasoning scaling seems to cover up for that just fine. The bottlenecks in capability are more about a lack of omnimodality and agentism which seem to be improving but on different paradigms. As well as cost in general, which will likely get better as soon as more and more data centers keep finishing up.</div>

There was an interview of Trump criticizing Dubya for the Iraq War around 20 years ago and Trump's advise was literally "declare victory and leave." It's all about the spin.

This all reminded me of the 2016 BBC documentary Hypernormalisation. The world is a stage and nothing is really what it seems.</div>

So the only takeaway from this entire post is that Russo's predictions in this topic may not be reliable. Beyond this, it adds no value to how you judge predictions.

But it is a good lesson for the crowd who believes anything optimistic anyone says.</div>

The claim hasn’t failed… yet.

Also if he was talking about calendar years, its failure to come to pass would be on 1. January 2026, 00:00:00.

Thing is, there are quite convincing looking AI generated video clips.

It is foreseeable that AI generated movies will become possible.</div>

What would it take for an AI to truly be an expert at fixing a semi truck for example?

If I look at the last two jobs I've had (massive corporate media companies), 99% of the digital information generated by the business was private information that stayed within the business. I think that's the case for most businesses. Also look at things like healthcare, the amount of data a hospital generates on a daily basis, 0% of that is public. All of it can be learned from.

  
Publicly available internet data is just a drop in the bucket, the issue is how do you make use of private data at scale.</div>

I think that sort of data has to be created for the specific purpose of creating training data for AGI.

Instead of trying to build the biggest pile of GPU's, build 3D cameras with lidars, robots... expand the worldwiev of AGI bejond textual representation.

To make a case we do not become all smart and shit by reading books. We become smart by playing in mud, assembling legos... and reading books.</div>

There are plenty of highly educated folks willing to work to generate more training data at the edges of human knowledge, but the profit-oriented nature of the whole enterprise makes it fall flat, as commerce always does. 

Do they want to train on new data? Then they have to tap into humans producing new data, that means research PhDs. But you have to give them more freedom. It's a balance.</div>

New release is a distraction, a controlled narrative to cover up the evidence that is already out there about Trump and Epstein.

 

Gawker released the Little Black Book in 2015, fully searchable here:

In 2002, immediately upon first learning that Epstein was chasing after little girls, Trump ended ALL association with Epstein, threw him out of Mar-a-Lago, and banned him for life from all of his properties.

In 2009, Trump was the only one who was willing to work with prosecutors in Epstein's pedophilia trial. All of this is documented FACT. Here's more:

They're pointing to Trump's flights on Epstein's jet as if that were proof of guilt, however his flights were between Palm Beach &amp; NY/NJ only. Epstein would offer Trump the use of his jet when Trump's was out-of-commission. Here are the flight logs for Epstein's jet. Pay attention to the departure and arrival codes.

LOGS [https://archive.org/details/epstein-flight-logs-unredacted\_202304/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/epstein-flight-logs-unredacted_202304/mode/2up)

CODES [https://airportcodes.aero](https://airportcodes.aero)

In addition, take note that Trump's LAST FLIGHT on Epstein's plane was in 1997 BEFORE Epstein bought the island. Epstein bought Little St. James in1998, and didn't move to LSJ and make it his home until 2005 after development of the property had been completed.

Trump ended his friendship with Epstein in 2002 (for the reasons above), so Trump COULDN'T have gone to Epstein's island.

They're also claiming that Trump raped a 13-year-old girl named Katie Johnson, The truth about that story is that it was a LIE and a proven LIE by the courts. NEVER happened. She LIED to the court; got CAUGHT, and her cases DISMISSED.

I used to take breaks by scrolling my phone, watching a quick video, or checking emails. But those breaks never actually felt like breaks. My brain was still running, just in a different direction.

I'm not saying I'm a "great" thinker, but I do what I would consider to be some of my greatest thinking (often nothing at all except what I can see and hear and smell) when I'm on a quick walk between "bigger" tasks.</div>

I tell her we were the generation born before social media. We can survive without it.

She also says that having no social media is a red flag in a guy because it implies he is hiding something... 🤷‍♂️

Like why tf do I need to show my life to the world.

Side note i was actually addicted to social media at one point. Too much clutter and I was getting addicted to tiktok vid...</div>

Honestly, it was like watching two bullies gang up on a schoolkid.

It’s absolutely stunning to live through a time when the US was in a Cold War with Russia to seeing the president of the US now bowing down to them and helping them attain goals to help enrich and support Russia.

                                <div class="reply-body">I'm pretty sure I know what he's referring to with the "German Documentary."  When the tic-tac video legitimately leaked (link below) on the ATS forums the video was inexplicably hosted on a German film company's website.  This was before YouTube was widely used, or maybe before it even existed.  I can't recall if it was ever really explained *why* the video was hosted there but that was a BIG part of why the community assumed the video was some kind of hoax.  The video didn't come from a documentary.

They both push the Alcubierre warp drive hypothesis, should we believe warp drive is disinfo?


I use to believe in warp drive even with the jupiter sized mass energy requirements but then it occured to me, what would happen to earth if jupiter suddenly appeared 10 miles above earth's surface?



Warp drive would reek havoc with the orbits of planets and other celestial bodies in our solar system. I think it is another brain drain like string theory is believed to be.


Further look at Lue for example, he puts out warp drive ideas for how ufos work as well.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">So I can add some context here. If you email Jack at all you have a 90% chance of being added to his email list where he kind of treats it like a social media ranting opportunity and 90% of people on it keep repeatedly asking to be taken off ( not to mention it's distributed the email details of a HUGE amount of people to each other) 

I can say with total confidence that it's not counter-intelligence it's just a very angry, intelligent guy that hasn't got a clue how emails or digital security work who just keeps hitting 'reply all' 

  
If anything he's very very bitter about NOT being on the inner-circle when it comes to podcasts and media opportunities/conferences. This isn't to say that I don't think he's a valuable and volatile voice on the subject.</div>

As for the OP's "two theories", I think getting "two theories" about what is happening regarding UFOs from about four recent podcasts, ignores that there's been real research into the phenomenon for a long time.  The OP would benefit from listening to [Stanton Friedman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUrgNWc9vRo) a bit more, and reading some [Hynek](https://www.slideshare.net/DirkTheDaring11/j-allen-hynek-the-ufo-experience-a-scientific-inquiry-1972) to know a bit about the theories.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Long time ago in the car on road trip, my kids wanted to play on tablets. Just for fun I've told them, first they need to memorize my phone number. They were motivated, it took them just a few minutes to learn. Then, from time to time I've checked, if they still remember that. It is well written in their little brains, lol.
 Just today I was contacted by emergency service, they had phone number from my child. Nothing life treating, but memorized phone number saved us from more potential troubles...</div>

Unrelated plus - I get to imagine the confusion on the face of someone when my kids sing a cheesy jingle to them just to give them my phone number. </div>

It was also a pretty shit song, everyone that hears it comments about the lack of rhythm and how it ends abruptly, but to me that’s what it made it so memorable!</div>

2. I get 8 hours of sleep a night
3. I eat a low-carb meal at lunch

Even with those 3 things considered, which everyone suggests is the "cause" of the afternoon slump, I still feel tired regardless, like clockwork. Is it just a natural physiological response that can't be avoided?

My brain is generally mush after 2pm. Other than suggesting I take a nap, which isn't feasible in the office, has anyone cracked this?</div>

I'm used to seeing her do dances and post pictures in exotic places and get millions of views. She didn't have her phone out or do any dances. Nobody recognized her and she was just living her normal life being apart of the basketball team like everyone.

It immediately made me think how fake social media really is. I've seen so many videos of her dancing that I just thought thats who she was....</div>

I've played around with creating SVGs a bit, for creating diagrams and such. It works reasonably well, and that in itself is a marvel, but it seems as if screenshotting it and asking it to fix weird mistakes and overlapping lines doesn't really make it perform a whole lot better. It's all mediated through text, not vision, perhaps that is the reason .. So indeed, like a blind person drawing.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Lex thinks he impressive but he’s really not if you examine his accomplishments. He earned his undergrad, masters and phd not only at the same university, but at the same university his daddy is a professor at and was graded on his work by his daddy’s colleagues. Had open access to the labs and materials at that school because of daddy. That’s academically shady. As a graduate of a university down the street from Drexel that is ranked significantly higher than Drexel, it would be more impressive if he at least went and received one of those degrees from a different university. All these dudes (Lex, Trump, Elon) have accomplished what they have because of Daddy and resources provided by daddy; none of them truly earned it themselves.</div>

This whole thing is being set up to where Zelenskyy is backed into an impossible corner and antagonized relentlessly so that when he doesn’t agree to a deal that gives up territory in exchange for nothing he can be painted as a warmonger and Trump and Russia get to play hero pretending that they wanted Peace but mean ol’ Zelenskyy is in the way.</div>
