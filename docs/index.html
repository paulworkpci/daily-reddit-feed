I am an introvert but I still have a big friend group, I just don't see them as often as the extroverts coz I need way more time to recharge after social situations. Like I need at least a whole week of alone time before I go to a social thing then afterwards I am exhausted. Meanwhile my extrovert friends are just out constantly. I can't do that shit. But when I am at a social thing I don't find it hard to talk to people - that would be social anxiety.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Both my cousin and I are like this. We're big introverts, usually needing at least a couple days to a week to recharge, but, we're both SUPER social people. Either of us can and usually make friends in line ups, lobbies, on the street, etc. We're more social than our extroverted friends in fact. It's usually a joke amongst those who know us that we just interact with the nearest person and make friends in weird places

I do think we're both hyper social and might be the exception here though. But I am introverted, and I do my time to myself. People know this about me and we both accept it. I embrace it, and others understand it. If I get a call to come hang out or go to a party and I say "I'm all social'd out, I'm going to chill by myself for a bit" they understand and don't push me because I won't have fun if I go, and I'll be moody, quiet, and seclusive.

Not saying you have to be hyper social, but people should embrace what they do and work in those parameters. It's easier when you give yourself permission to be who you are. I'm going to spend this Sunday locked in my room playing Outer Worlds finally (awesome game btw). My friend group knows I'm out for any plans this weekend.

EDIT: I forgot to mention, extroverts can be anti social and have social anxiety too. The amount of talks I have with my extroverted friends on "Was I a little weird yesterday?" And so on is a lot. In fact, it's disproportionate compared to my introverted friends, likely because they aren't comfortable talking about it as much though.</div>

If anyone has the video footage or link im glad to receive it. Either it got scrubbed or deleted. I am a 100% sure i have seen it on YT. And to the people speaking on the AI thing you are absolutely right. I just hope to find the video because it is unfindable. The moving shadow is actually in the video . LOVE AND PEACE!

I have a comic anthology book from 1995 that outlines in detail the Phobos 2 alien conspiracy (amongst many other things), so by 1995 it was well known enough to be getting a comic book adaptation. For the curious the book is The Big Book of Conspiracies by Doug Moench, amusingly the comics in that book are a good summary of what is \*still\* being debated across the internet 30 years later.</div>

Marina Popovich, a well respected soviet Air Force colonel, engineer, and decorated Soviet test pilot, who also holds more than one hundred aviation world records on over 40 types of aircraft over her career, is one of the people who highlighted these images and held a press conference, stating that the Soviet military and civilian pilots had confirmed 3000 UFO sightings and that the Soviet Air Forces and KGB had recovered fragments of five crashed UFOs.

---

This is objectively not a good start so far:

* Lie about "drones"
* Bury the UAP issue under 5 conspiracies the "Task Force" will never get to with an arbitrary 6 month deadline
* Gutting agencies like NOAA that research UAPs for no reason that nobody asked for
* Zero action from the White House, executive orders about everything under the sun except UAPs

                                <div class="reply-body">The FAA lie was the worst development in the post Dec 2017 UFO timeline.  

It was like hearing "We will never tell you the truth" broadcast from the White House podium.  

At least we used to get Obama's candid interviews on talk shows.  And the Schumer Amendment (gutted by republicans).  There were still lies (Susan Gough, Kirkpatrick/AARO, Bill Nelson trying to discredit David Grousch, etc) but the DOD did the UFO lying from the WH podium during the Dem administrations.  

Now WH press secretary and staff do the lying on their behalf instead of representing US as our elected officials.  That sucks.</div>

The video talked about how we’re always anxious and never bored anymore. Think about it, when was the last time you were truly bored? Not the “ugh, this routine is dull” kind of bored, but the “I have absolutely nothing to do” kind of bored. 

For me, that was probably when I was a kid. These days I’m always occupied. My brain is constantly engaged, there’s always something to...</div>

The boy has had a phone in his hands since he was really young because his parents found it easier to just give him a screen instead of dealing with him. On the other hand, the girl isn’t allowed to watch TV for more than an hour a day.

And you can really see the difference in how they act. The girl is super smart for her age, she knows about current events, different sports, and sm recipes. She spends a lot of time with her parents, so she learns a lot just from being around them. And the boy is the complete opposite. He throws tantrums all the time, doesn’t talk to people properly, and is way behind his younger cousin in terms of knowledge and social skills. I know I shouldn’t be comparing kids like this but it’s so shocking.</div>

Now everyone thinks they'll die if they don't have a phone glued somewhere on their person.

It's not unreasonable to have all the kids put their phones in a container and collect them after class.

I've been thinking about doing something like this because I've been feeling like my mind has been full, and this has been going on for months now, so I thought about not having social media, but my mind kept telling me it was going to be something bad. 

I already deleted social media apps for months last year, but for me the most difficult part is once you're finished with the "break period" and want to go back to social media again. I don't know how to do it so I don't fall into this mind-overwhelming feeling.</div>

As of now, I don’t feel like going back on social media, partly because I’m afraid I might fall back into old patterns, and partly because I genuinely don’t find any value there. If I want to be entertained, I have better ways without feeling guilty, overwhelmed, or anxious.

My goal is to have the apps on my phone and still not use them (why does it feel like a crazy goal?) But I feel like I’m currently recovering, and throwing myself into the middle of triggers won’t help with healing. So, I think I’m going to avoid it. Also, I just feel GOOD without them. And I don’t feel like I’m missing out on anything (which is weird because I always used to feel that way)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is such a ridiculous argument from the start. Like he’s the first billionaire/multimillionaire who somehow was devoid of greed and not wanting to just accumulate more wealth for the sake of wealth, like they all do.

Reminds me of the quote from The Departed, “I haven’t *needed* the money since I stole little Timmy’s lunch money in 6th grade. But I like it it”.

People talk all the time about how politicians are bought and paid and they never thought about who is dying the buying and paying. All they did was cut out the middle man and put the wealthy businessman right into office.

Or even more ridiculous is when they’d talk about how “he doesn’t have to do this! Why would he choose to run for president if he didn’t care when he could just be retired?”

Like every single authoritarian or even just politician is just a bleeding heart and taking the most powerful position in the world out of the goodness of their heart, not because they want power.</div>

**The Dancing Plague of 1518**

Per Google ai:

“The "dancing plague" refers to a series of historical events, particularly in 1518 in Strasbourg, where people danced uncontrollably for days, often until exhaustion or death, with theories ranging from mass hysteria to ergot poisoning. 

The dancing plague, also known as choreomania or St. Vitus' Dance, was a phenomenon where groups of people would spontaneously start dancing, seemingly against their will, and continue for days or even weeks, of...</div>

Back in 1990 my girlfriend and I attended a demonstration against the Poll Tax in London. Things descended into chaos and there was the biggest riot in Central London for decades

We were walking through the streets around Trafalgar Square in an area that the police had lost control of. All around us was looting, vandalism and affray. Batshit craziness. Weird energies

On a street corner some guys had a 'ghetto blaster' stereo and were cranking out the Beastie Boys' hit single "Fight for Your Right" on a loop. About a dozen individuals were locked into an energetic writhing, cavorting crazy dance to the music with a manic expression on their faces. It was a bizarre sight in the middle of everything else that was kicking off around us

As we walked past them then I kid you not we were somehow pulled in and joined the throng, thrusting our limbs about in an unhinged fashion like the other participants. We both agreed later that we'd felt absolutely compelled to dance - no cognitive decision was made by either of us. I saw other bystanders getting sucked in too - by the time the track finshed there were maybe 20 of us

When it ended it was like we'd snapped out of a trance and we managed to get the fuck away as the opening bars of the song started up again. 

Not sure if my meandering drivel does it any justice whatsoever lol, but it was without doubt one of the Top 3 strangest experience of my life</div>

It takes an assemblage working together in just the right way to make something like that happen. It’s so wild and seems impossible, but happens all the time. Then again, think of how many things must occur for something like a blackout to happen. 

Stuff like this really only makes sense after the fact, and, even then, might amount no one having any clue why some specific thing occurred.</div>

I learned to live in the moment, spending only limited time on Reddit (4 times a day for 5 minutes per session). People now spend an average of seven hours a day on their phones, and I realized that excessive social media use is often unproductive—scrolling mindlessly through content that’s easily forgotten.

All i want to say is its weird once you decide to not be on here as much, you do have a realization that no one cares either if youre online or not.  Staying away from the drama too thats online is great, i get triggered alot by it.

The difference? I'm much more tired than when I drank caffeine, and far less productive.

That's the truth.

No memory improvements. No brain fog difference. No anxiety reduction. Honestly i'm less productive than before, probably about 50% as productive.

Caffeine made me feel good and locked in. I feel unplugged without it most of the time.

I’ve heard many great minds (Darwin, Einstein, many great writers and creators, etc) worked “productively” like 3-4 hours a day, and then mostly slacked around or did some low effort chores or hobbies.</div>

I sleep in and slack around most of the day. I'll play sports in the evening and then at night I am a total machine at my desk for 3-4 hours where I get everything done. It's just that when I had caffeine that 3-4 hours turned into 6-7 hours.</div>

I stopped because I had a focal seizure and caffeine now triggers an uneasy feeling in me.

I haven't touched it since because anything super stimulating now gives me depersonalization/derealization.

I miss caffeine everyday, and may try to build tolerance to it again very slowly. I'm still fairly productive (especially at night) and have natural drive for success, but caffeine took me from about 70% functionality to 110%.</div>
