                        <div class="comment-body">"Cleaning something up" is very ambiguous. Hence the results you are getting. 
Tell it what you want it to do. Refactor to improve efficiency? Fix it? Provide as much context as you can. What specifically don't you like about your current function. Explain to ai what you mean by messy. 

I find explaining the desired outcome and also the current outcome helps. 

User stories help too. E.g "as a user I want to be able to attach images to my to do items"</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This is important. There are a lot of people who think there's no skill involved in prompting, when in fact, it makes the difference between someone who can use AI effectively and someone who can't ever seem to get it to work right.

I'm currently on a team that's VERY AI-enabled and everyone on the team is a skilled prompt engineer.  We've absolutely blown the doors off this current project. Blew through all the customer's requirements in just over half the project time and we've been spending the last half adding wish-list features.

But skill plays into in so many ways. Not just knowing how to write prompts, but knowing when to refactor (because the AIs work better with smaller files and functions, just like people do), know when to create a plan vs just going straight to coding, etc. It takes time and practice to learn these things and to learn to intuit how the AI responds to various methods.

It's no uncommon for me to spend 20+ minutes writing a detailed prompt, but that detailed prompt might give me a 4 hours worth of code which I might spend an hour or two debugging, on average.  The investment in writing a good prompt with context and examples, if necessary, is worth it.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Tagging on to the skill level bit:


Anyone using these tools in a "Here's my problem, solve it" type of general way are not using these tools properly and will waste tons of time.


Programming is all about taking a complex problem and breaking down that problem into boilerplate level code. Complexity of a project comes in how that boilerplate code interacts with other boilerplate code.


If you break down the problem enough, these LLMs will give you working code for your application. If you expect these tools, in their current iteration, to just do your entire job for you, you're going to have a bad time.


The people that say these things aren't good at code generation are very loudly saying "I don't want to think about this in anyway shape or form, you do that for me."


The critique thus being "This tool doesn't behave the way it does in my head, it wasted time, I should have just done this myself."


I'm sure DOS users had similar critiques about Microsoft Word. </div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Using Strassen’s two-level algorithm it took 49 steps to do a 4x4 matrix multiplication. AlphaTensor did this with 47 steps in 2022...

But AlphaTensor's version could only do this for a very limited set of numbers using binary. AlphaEvolve takes 48 steps but actually applies to all values so it is actually useful and I suppose will be applied to basically all matrix math making everything &lt;~2% faster.

This is cool, but... maybe not \*quite\* as cool as it sounds at first blush.

These new discoveries seem to be of a narrow type.  Specifically, AlphaEvolves apparently generates custom algorithms to construct very specific combinatorial objects.  And, yes, these objects were sometimes previously unknown.  Two examples given are:

* "a configuration of 593 outer spheres \[...\] in 11 dimensions."
* "an algorithm to multiply 4x4 complex-valued matrices using 48 scalar multiplications"

Now... a special configuration of 593 spheres in 11 dimensions is kinda cool.  But also very, very specific.  It isn't like proving a general mathematical theorem.  It isn't like anyone was suffering because they could previously pack in only 592 kissing spheres in 11 dimensions.

So this is an improvement, but there's still room for lots \*more\* improvements before mathematicians become unemployed.

(Also, constructing one-off combinatorial objects is compute-intensive, and-- ingenious algorithms aside-- DeepMind surely has orders of magnitude more compute on hand than random math people who've approached these problems before.)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">“By finding smarter ways to divide a large matrix multiplication operation into more manageable subproblems, it sped up this vital kernel in Gemini’s architecture by 23%, leading to a 1% reduction in Gemini's training time. Because developing generative AI models requires substantial computing resources, every efficiency gained translates to considerable savings. Beyond performance gains, AlphaEvolve significantly reduces the engineering time required for kernel optimization, from weeks of expert effort to days of automated experiments, allowing researchers to innovate faster.”

                        <div class="comment-body">They released a podcast today with a lab that got prerelease access to the paper and had time to mull it over. It’s pleasant, but be aware it’s an hour long.

They said the next generation was cooking and would be ready “in the coming months”. It’s not unusual for Google to do a one-two punch like this, and honestly, I don’t believe this is the only radical thing they have coming down the pipes.

There’s a patent they applied for, for composability in attaching neural networks to each other without catastropic forgetting, and the same patent, a technique to add new layers inside a neural network without experiencing catastrophic forgetting. Kind of a dream of composability there. 

If you need spare capacity, just add layers, you don’t have to retrain from scratch! Need to graft a dog identifying network to a cat identifying network? Okay. 👀 (*Disclaimer: I have no idea exactly what is meant by composable here, this is me being a bit snarky*)

Also, whatever they’ve done with large context windows is radical. They may only have a one million token context window, but it’s flawless compared to everyone else’s. There’s something neat going on there too.

Let me unravel the mistery - It's about sitting there (standing or lying down works too) and doing nothing. Maybe breating more deeply, maybe closing your eyes, if you want. But in the essence, just doing nothing.

That's it. Secret to medidation. Sit and do nothing. Easier said than done though, if your whole life you were trained to always do something (most harmful world of 21st century is "productivity", I'm convinced about that), otherwise you'd be a lesser human being.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">People tend to confuse mediation with a new-age concept that requires very specific criteria and states of mind to achieve. 

In reality, true mediation can be easily achieved and is probably achieved without even knowing. A classic Buddhist proverb is:

Before enlightenment: sweep the dirt, rake the leaves.

After enlightenment: sweep the dirt, rake the leaves. 

Mediation is then principally about letting go of any fears and anxieties, and the easiest way to achieve this is by simply not thinking about much at all for a while. A walk in a forest, fishing, doing woodwork, these are all forms of mediation. 

Over time you can ‘remember’ the ‘letting go’ state, and do it without needing to do the above tasks.</div>

Or hardware manufacturers face some sort of a crisis so all the ai companies face a shortage blocking their progress. Or for example there is a significant sun flare that hits earth and fries majority of electronics, rendering all ai infrastructure useless. Hippies always claim you should just let everything go, and then they complain how things get bad for them. 

There is always something to prepare for, the least you can do is invest in your and your family health, not to mention learning new skills that will help you in your daily life, like cooking or fixing stuff around the house. If you want to prepare for something hypothetical that nobody understands, just do yourself a favor and become the best version of yourself, that's the best scenario you can follow.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">when we will achieve a post-scarcity economy, nature, space, peace won't be that scarce aswell

people might believe that there not enough place for everyone on Earth but it's a mistake to believe so as most of the space used mainly come from agriculture then natural reserve and only after that, urban environment, when we will achieve infinite labour+energy we will make most of our foods in hydroponic tower and laboratory, we will basically industrialize foods without any need of nature anymore

nature space will likely greatly increase and that include savage animal in their natural habitat, if post-AI society allow us to build every basic infrastructure any metropolis have but for the countryway then we will likely witness a de-urbanization movement with villages and smaller city becoming far more common as there won't be the burden of jobs or lack of doctor in such scenario 

i'll argue that the only good thing to prepare today is putting as much money you can in your bank account so the transition be as peacefull it's possible when everyone become jobless and prepare a few month of water and food reserve for your family in case of civil unrest in a worst case scenario - building up this reserve take a lot of time unless you're wealthy, better start as soon you can afford</div>

I mean the 911 and company are still very dynamic cars, they’re good fun at 4-6/10, just not as fun as an s2000 or miata (imo)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s no surprise that ITT nobody is discussing why they recommend fasting for cancer treatment and prevention. I said this in a separate comment but it was buried so I’ll say it again here:

There’s loads of evidence that fasting has immense benefits to your health. Specifically, in treating and preventing cancer it reduces insulin-like growth factor which reduces the risk of uncontrolled cell division. It enhances autophagy which allows the body to clean up cancerous cells. It reduces inflammation which is a key driver of most cancers. It reprograms your metabolism by reducing insulin and glucose levels which can starve cancerous cells. It enhances DNA repair preventing cancerous mutations. And it boosts your immune system fortifying your body against cancerous cells. Perhaps we should be focusing on educating people on how to prevent cancer because clearly we haven’t discovered anything close to a cure.

&gt; *The firehose of falsehood, also known as firehosing, is a propaganda technique in which a large number of messages are broadcast rapidly, repetitively, and continuously over multiple channels (like news and social media) without regard for truth or consistency. An outgrowth of Soviet propaganda techniques, the firehose of falsehood is a contemporary model for Russian propaganda under Russian President Vladimir Putin.*

&gt; *The Russian government… continued to use it as part of its interference in the 2016 United States elections, largely aided by the repetition of Russian falsehoods by Donald Trump, who has made constant lying a key part of his communication strategy. Politicians, governments, and movements in other countries have since adopted the use of the same tactics.*

Joe Rogan and his intellectual dark web (fucking *criiiinge*) buddies are useful idiots for this very purpose, undermining truth to allow for fascists to set their own narratives.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Sorry if this is semi irrelevant to this sub, but I'm willing to hire someone who can solve some of my issues with some code I'm working on. Someone who's more experienced, knowledgeable. Who knows, maybe it'll take them 30 minutes what took me days to figure out

So let me ask this: On such sites, do you have to pay even if they don't end up solving the issues with the code, or delivering the product (app)?</div>

If you weren’t a professional developer before you started vibe coding your codebase is probably a dumpster fire. If you were a professional developer and you just YOLOd it 24/7 while vibe coding its probably the same.</div>

But then they decide it shouldn’t take longer than 30 minutes and refuse to pay for more than that, because in their mind, paying more would mean some greedy bastard is cheating them. :D

How do you suddenly go from "I have no idea" to "I know exactly how long this should take you"?  
Nothing against OP, it's a common trend :D</div>

I know you're probably right, but from a functional perspective, it works up until the 8th step where I'm just stuck in the workflow and googling and stackoverflow just don't help me.</div>

The contractor is not beholden to any more than that, and they won't be paid in full for any less than that. People usually go through discovery for software projects, and pay for that time, to nail down this estimate to create a rock solid statement of work.
