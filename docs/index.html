The vast majority of OpenAI customers use these language models to offload their social skills in order to become more competitive in the human arena.  As of right now people skills are way more important than being the best coder in the world or the hardest worker.  So I’m not terribly upset that OpenAI did some market research and created a product that their customers wanted.   I just hope they don’t get lost in sauce and stop pursuing ASI</div>

If it is it might explain why they delayed releasing it, if 4.5 is $150 per million tokens imagine how much o3 would have cost if it used 4.5 as it's base. 

o1 is 6 times more expensive than 4o, could they change $900/million tokens for o3??</div>

Interestingly its LCB generation is really high, something characteristic of reasoning models, but its code-completion is capped along with all the other models.  
What I find even more peculiar is that O3-mini High has code-completion of 86, but medium has 50? How does this jump make sense.  
Since GPT-4.5 has a really big knowledge-base and really good contextual understanding, along with these great coding scores, it could be absolutely crazy at programming.

I'm unsure it is actually usable in Cursor though, because input tokens cost $75 per million!! You would have to be extremely selective about your context.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">LiveBench tests models on competitive coding problems, while SWE-bench tests on Github Issues. 

Competitive coding tasks typically have simple descriptions and are solvable with a relatively small amount of code in a single file, but require a significant amount of reasoning/mathematical/creative ability. Github issues often concern less reasoning/mathematics, but involve large code bases that include many files.

Although both of these can be valuable in assessing model strength, they serve different purposes. Claude is more optimized for SWE-bench like tasks and not so much for competitive coding tasks.</div>

&gt; plz code a game in python.
the theme is its like pong, but u bet on a team.
there is 2 teams ranodmly generated of different AIs that play pong with different colors
the AIs can have like various speed sizes and intelligwnce
it can be 1v2, 1v3, 2v3 etc
as the player u just need to guess the winner nad then u get to watch the game


While not perfect, i think 4.5 did the best result i tested so far.


the physics were smooth, the AI felt intelligent enough, the ball is at the right speed, etc.

I think that sort of data has to be created for the specific purpose of creating training data for AGI.

Instead of trying to build the biggest pile of GPU's, build 3D cameras with lidars, robots... expand the worldwiev of AGI bejond textual representation.

&gt;“Pre-training as we know it will unquestionably end,” Sutskever said onstage. This refers to the first phase of AI model development, when a large language model learns patterns from vast amounts of unlabeled data — typically text from the internet, books, and other sources.

&gt;He compared the situation to fossil fuels: just as oil is a finite resource, the internet contains a finite amount of human-generated content.

&gt;“We’ve achieved peak data and there’ll be no more,” according to Sutskever. “We have to deal with the data that we have. There’s only one internet.”

&gt;Along with being “agentic,” he said future systems will also be able to reason. Unlike today’s AI, which mostly pattern-matches based on what a model has seen before, future AI systems will be able to work things out step-by-step in a way that is more comparable to thinking.

Essentially he is saying what has been stated for several months. That the gains from pretraining have all been exhausted and that the only way forward is test time compute and other methods that have not materialized, like JEPA. 

Ben Goertzel predicted all of this several years ago: 

&gt;The basic architecture and algorithmics underlying ChatGPT and all other modern deep-NN systems is totally incapable of general intelligence at the human level or beyond, by its basic nature. Such networks could form part of an AGI, but not the main cognitive part.

&gt;And ofc one should note by now the amount of $$ and human brainpower put into these "knowledge repermuting" systems like ChatGPT is immensely greater than the amount put into alternate AI approaches paying more respect to the complexity of grounded, self-modifying cognition

&gt;Currently out-of-the-mainstream approaches like OpenCog Hyperon, NARS, or the work of Gary Marcus or Arthur Franz seems to have much more to do with actual human-like and ++ general intelligence, even though the current results are less shiny and exciting

&gt;Just like now the late 1970s - early 90s wholesale skepticism of multilayer neural nets and embrace of expert systems looks naive, archaic and silly

&gt;Similarly, by the mid/late 2020s today's starry-eyed enthusiasm for LLMs and glib dismissal of subtler AGI approaches is going to look soooooo ridiculous

&gt;My point in this thread is not that these LLM-based systems are un-cool or un-useful -- just that they are a funky new sort of narrow-AI technology that is not as closely connected to AGI as it would appear on the surface, or as some commenters are claiming</div>

I watch long form content mostly, basically all day. I can’t do anything without my phone. If i’m cooking i’m watching youtube, if im sleeping im listening to it. I tried to get a box and lock it and I got so agitated I broke into the box and took my phone back. If addiction to screens is a thing i’m definitely am.

                        <div class="comment-body">Ok first: give yourself grace. You need to understand that this whole situation? It's not an accident. It's not a failure of your willpower. The people who design these phones and apps know a lot more about how human brains work than you do, and they use that to make sure they make money off your attentionb and they make it *hard* to quit. 


So. You are gonna need to start by finding something that soothes you that is not your phone. I'm gonna go old school here and say food, masturbation, or meditation. Exercise is good too. 


Then you are going to need to practice. Don't go cold turkey if that's failing. Set a schedule, and start small. Fifteen minutes. Then twenty. Then half an hour. Time yourself. Track your anxiety. If it spikes, stop increasing until you feel more confident that you have your anxiety under control. 


Start researching anxiety... Offline. Go to a library and look at a physical book. It will be slow, and inefficient, and weird, but it will be an experience. 


It took time to get here, it will take time to leave, but you can do this. </div>

I don’t have a job right now, there isn’t a lot of food in my house we can’t really afford to go grocery shopping as much as we used to. I read two books in those 4 days, and I loved those books but I never felt that accomplishment feeling, that hit of dopamine. I don’t even remember the last time I even felt that. I used to masterbate a lot and my sex drive is basically none existent rn but that’s fine idc about that.</div>

also, i deleted my social media apps like instagram, but anyway, I am always listening to something on youtube. so idk. 

i had a dumb phone in my recent past for a year and it was the best. i was present, not afraid of staying alone with my thoughts and more in creative mood. constantly consuming is draining af.

for me having the burner phone its the only solution, since i feel like don’t have a willpower (right now) to limit myself..but also I don’t have the balls to switch since everything and everyone is online now</div>

I feel like the recent over dramatization of the egg video and the Jake Barber story is doing more harm than good for the UFO community. At least some people are losing hope with this new shift toward woo-woo rather than focusing on the actual physical evidence that is claimed to be hidden from us. Maybe there is some woo-woo aspect to it, but if we need public trust, then we need to focus on the nuts-and-bolts side of things. David Grusch said he knows where the crafts and bodies are; there have been many incidents where they had near collisions with flights, etc. I think this phenomenon needs to be explored first using the available data rather than by making up supernatural theories and extraordinary claims. That can all be done once we see the craft at hand, in my opinion.

  
With Ramamoorthi's appointment to the new task force, I think we can be hopeful that the right questions will be asked.

Do you think Dave got into the right wing to ban abortions and bring back christian values? Or was he and his ilk fooled to go right wing because of ridiculous culture war issues?</div>

Shooting pain, discomfort sitting, standing, even lying down felt off... wish I had taken care of my back earlier

My doctor told me my bad posture was culprit with cheapy chair and too much sitting from grinding sessions.

I think the issue isn’t sitting too much, it’s actually not moving enough!

Lower back pain is actually pretty common. A lot of people deal with it, and most of the time, it’s because the lower back muscles are weak.

Stretching is good for temporary relief, but it doesn't fix the real problem.

What really helps is regular movement, exercise, and doing the right exercises to strengthen your lower back muscles.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The correct answer and it bothers me that so many people just ignore it. 

What's silly as hell is that 99.99% of posture and pain problems that haven't resulted in severe damage can be solved or at least stem from what you're saying. Every one with the shortened title "PT" has told me the same (Personal Trainers, Physical Therapists) - you fix this stuff with movement and strengthening. 

Meanwhile - people make a killing off of programs that are just fancy stretch programs or ridiculous devices...and people waste their time and money on it. No - holding your shoulders back and sitting up in your chair won't fix your posture and pain, but strengthening muscles and working hard at it will likely allow you to more easily maintain better posture. 

***

The only thing I'd add to what you're saying is that if you do have occasional back pain, get in with a deep tissue therapist during a time when you aren't dealing with pain, or the pain is at its most tolerable point. Long story short, one very intense hour of painful massage with crunching up of scar tissue and fascia in my lower back got rid of my crippling flare ups. Repeat visits (as well as strengthening, etc.), resulted in the elimination of the occasional ten second stabbing pains that would hit when transitioning in/out of my car after a very long day of working on my feet.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Go look through the computer science college kids' sub, the main tech sub, or any dev sub. People are miles away from talking about UBI, they're still in denial that the job market is going to shift in the first place.

Company XY is reducing its workforce because optimization? (And that's always happening, AI or not)

Those subs (funnily enough, this one too sometimes) just choose to ignore such news or even throw on their tinfoil hats, claiming it's fake. Like, bro, just ask the devs at the company,it's not exactly hard to confirm. Peak ignoring reality.

Or when I mention that my work let go of 80% of our front-end devs, I get downvoted, and nobody believes me. Even though I can't think of a single reason why anyone would lie about that, and even though this is one of the rare moments I’m actually trying to be helpful, telling people what they should do to keep their jobs in an AI-dominated future. I don't get it. But well, you can't save people who don't want to be saved.

Also, devs being against new tech is never not funny. I remember, like it was yesterday, when people were all, "The cloud is just a fad, no reason to learn anything about this shit tech." And before that, "The internet is just a fad, no reason to learn this shit tech." 
Which is especially funny because we’re a company whose entire reason for existence is making products out of bleeding-edge technology, untangling the spaghetti shit of research and turning it into actual software.

Why are you even working here in the first place if you hate new tech?!

It's literally always the same type of dev, the pseudo-enlightened neckbeard who thinks he’s smarter than actual computer science research. The "ackshually" guy everyone hates because, in all his enlightened glory, he forgets to actually perform. And when new tech comes around that enables companies to cut the deadwood, they’re toast. And those cycles happen every 10-15 years.

That’s how you end up a being 50-year-old boomer dev without a job and without skills. But that’s not AI’s fault, or the cloud's or the internet's... that’s on you.</div>

Exactly.

Money saved through AI augmentation ( aka efficiency), will be re-invested in other areas of the company, where AI augmentation is not possible (yet).

And this is how AI will make companies more competitive in the marketplace.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/TommyShelbyPFB:

Greer also recently claimed that he personally "briefed" Luna, Burchett and Moskowitz on UFOs:

[https://x.com/disgustipated42/status/1890877445210775902](https://x.com/disgustipated42/status/1890877445210775902)

I'm sure this can be easily verified. Someone ask one of these people on Twitter if this is yet another lie.

Many have been asserting that GPT-4.5 is proof that “scaling laws are failing” or “failing the expectations of improvements you should see” but coincidentally these people never seem to have any actual empirical trend data that they can show GPT-4.5 scaling against.

So what empirical trend data can we look at to investigate this? Luckily we have notable data analysis organizations like EpochAI that have established some downstream scaling laws for language models that a...</div>

Quit bean counting compute. This shouldn't even be a real metric, at least not for industry behemoths. Let deepseek figure out optimizations. We never know what emerges out of these blackboxes until it does. The only way forward is to keep pumping silicon.</div>

This model is only about 10X leap over GPT-4, and this is verified by multiple OpenAI researchers and even verified by satellite imagery analysis that proves their largest cluster would only have the power at the time to train with around 10X compute of GPT-4, not 100X.

So this 10X is actually also perfectly in-line with the GPT-4.5 name</div>

I was balancing a full-time job, studying math and computer science in my second year, overseeing the construction of a new house, and parenting a three-year-old. It was a lot, sure—but I had systems in place. My time was *managed*.

Then April hit. And everything came crashing down at once.

The house was finally ready, and we had just three weeks to move in. My job ramped up with multiple high-priority projects launchi...</div>
