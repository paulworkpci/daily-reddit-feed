There is Pro Israel Maga (and so Anti Iran and Anti Syria), and there is Pro Russia Maga (and so by extention, Pro Iran, pro Assad, anti Israel maga)

Every Maga influencer who voices anything anti Israel spouts Kremlin narratives.

Every Maga influencer who voices anything anti Moscow spouts AIPAC narratives.  

There's very little crossover and this is now the space where "push comes to shove"</div>

1. Haifa Arabs were not kicked out, Haifa to this day is a multi ethnic city with a big Arab population, 2.2 million Arabs live in Israel as full right citizens.
2. The Nakba also happened on the Jewish side, in which 0 Jews remained in Gaza and the WB following the 1948 war.
3. The war actually started in 1947 between the Jews and Arabs as a civil war when the Jews accepted the 1947 UN partition and the Arabs rejected, which caused the war to start.
4. "Overwhelming force" - it was not clear the Jews would win in 1947, Jewish settlements were under siege, famously Jewish residents of Jerusalem were medieval blockaded with no food or water for months until Jewish forces manages to break through and relieve the siege.</div>

Since the dawn of these tools I’ve only paid for my own API keys. And if there’s any tool that isn’t first party (Claude Code) or something that doesn’t take my API key, I haven’t been considering them no matter what their feature set is.

Right now one such tool is Warp which I want to consider but I saw a GitHub issue for adding API key support and the maintainer only talked about their recently reduced pricing 💀.</div>

I'm envisioning these giant mega structures where they shove people in 500 sq ft apartments. Your UBI would go to your rent on the place and you'd have enough left over to buy food and maybe if you save for a while a luxury every once in a while.   
  
I think it will take some getting used to for people, especially if they are forced out of their homes because AI took their jobs and they can't afford their mortgage on their UBI payments.</div>

If Amazon has a fully robotic workforce by 2030… it means a lot of other companies do as well, or are planning on it. Either way - it’s mass layoffs. 

So who exactly are going to be Amazon’s customers? Who’s going to be shopping on Prime Day?</div>

If your ROI on a robot is a few years and the markets start to dry up before the cost is returned, was it worth it?

More realistically though, it's likely that prices will only be lowered enough to start moving products again and we'll stay there.</div>

We have different types of adopters. 

Innovators adopts tech straight away the moment it is released. It is very low percentage like 2.5% of all users. 

Early adopters. Maybe will wait for a year or so and will adopt second version. 16%

Early majority. 30% can wait around 5 years to adopt. 

Late majority. 30%. Can wait 10 years to adobt. For example, me. Only few months back I bought my first smart watch. While it has been around for a while. 

Laggards. The rest. May or may not adobt at all. For example. My grandparents still don’t have a smart phone

So saying that everyone will have by 2030  is ridiculous. </div>

Zuck thinks that internet &amp; the marketing ad market behind it is already dead or going to decline fast? He was smart with mobile shift, buying good companies. AI companies are becoming more expensive to buy. 
2. And current team at FAIR is bad? The Cognitive Internet that is going to emerge will need good agents (may not need ASI), but without that positioning best talent might join Ilya ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Whenever i try and show beginers, i just give them one simple set of instructions with one simple condition. Sit still and do nothing. Then , if u can, realize when you discover your lost in thought, then gently pull yourself back the best way u can. Sometimes u cannot. Stay there for set amount of time. No matter whst.  And the condition is that no matter how many times u fall out or how little u realize any control.... u must not get flustered in any way. I know this is a slightly more "jobby" than your approach but I think new people benefit more when they have simple instruction. It seems to hypertrophy the attention muscle. In orderto open up to direct presence "everything is as it is" requires a little more focus and understanding on remaining the passive witness . That sort of understanding is not quite realized in the begining. But im no expert and please forgive me if I characterized your technique in any wrong way.</div>

I would just say that being flustered is ok too.  Just accept whatever is.

Brillaintly put. Your post is so clear and uncomplicated it could help a lot of people and I believe if I had seen it years ago it might have been a great pointer for me.

&gt;**I just wish someone would have pointed me towards this 20 years ago before I wasted my time chasing experiences.**

Sādhu! Sādhu! Sādhu! Again for emphasis:

&gt;**Meditation is just life happening - and you noticing what's happening. It's a realization, not a doing.**

I would hope this remains in some way very easy to find in this subreddit and be one of the first things people see or read in this subreddit.

&gt; **Of course meditation can get complicated and deeper than this message. This message is aimed for the frustrated beginners.** 

Yes, there are specific insights or "how to observe" beyond what you explained but similarly meditation to *me* is little more than self-observation or rather observation of reality with special insight or clear seeing.

It is possible, especially for new meditators to miss the plain seeing or observing aspect when it gets cluttered with technicalities and dhamma language (as my posts tend to be).</div>

I think the west has conflated meditation with relaxation and stress reduction and it can be a disservice to what it actually is.  Obviously relaxation and stress reduction are amazing byproducts of meditation I think it misses the whole point and muddies the waters when it's presented as some goal.</div>

"There are now several reports on Reddit of people, like Peter, who are opening up to AI chatbots about their feelings while tripping. These reports often describe such experiences in mystical language. “Using AI this way feels somewhat akin to sending a signal into a vast unknown—searching for meaning and connection in the depths of co...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I'll adopt the counter here: An LLM (particularly one which has been primed in advance) sounds like an incredible way to ameliorate risk. I've had a couple challenging trips where my inner thoughts couldn't be expressed to a human sitter either because I didn't want to reveal them to another human, or because I knew my lack of verbal coherency would frustrate me when communicating to another human. An LLM could potentially solve both of those things and to boot, should be much better following a [basic cognitive processing flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_processing_therapy#Therapy_elements) than the average human.

I do see some risk with schizophrenic or conspiratorial types (the kind of people who shouldn't be using hallucinogens in the first place) but this sounds like a pretty incredible tool for everyone else, especially if you have experience with hallucinogens already.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">BBC interviewed some AI influencers a few months back. One pair were a girl and guy running an account for an AI model. They actually travelled to different locations to shoot real photos. The guy would take pictures of the girl and later together they edited them. Generally the girl would wear clothes and accessories similar to the AI model.

They would use the real shots for reference, composite the AI model into the shot and then clean it up further with AI.</div>

I was interested in some reference manuals or a dictionary or something, so I was asking about what the options where, because to order something like that on the early internet accross the world you kind of needed to know exactly what it was called or you'd get some touristy thing.

Oh my lord, the people who crawled up my ass before they deleted my post. I *did* google it first, btw.</div>

I've been in like so many different boxes and i've seen all kind of behavior.  


In one of them there was an extreme fight with punches and blood all over the floor. The reason: someone started using an assault bike when someone else thought it was their turn... chipper workout where the first to get to the bikes section can use it. This was very extreme behavior and no one was k...</div>

I was doing deadlifts, I even used mats under the plates and didn’t drop them, but some women complained it was too loud and the manager kicked me out. It wasn’t planet fitness either. No one even talked to me before hand.

I’m actually grateful for how chill crossfit is.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Long before I had a gym or was even coaching, I was in this class once. 

The coach is this extremely chill guy who cares deeply about the people he trains. 

Halfway through class, this member who often spaces out and stares into the void, is spacing out and staring into the void. He’s not causing any trouble, just out of it. He sometimes seemed like he was staring at women in the class but it was obvious he was just… out of it. 

Well apparently this other guy thought that he was staring him down. He got upset and started yelling. The quasi-stoner snapped out of it and started asking basically “what the hell?”

The angry guy just gets angrier and he’s getting more upset, telling the guy he’s a pervert and disgusting. 

Our stoner guy is basically really confused. As you’d expect.

This angel of a trainer stops the entire class and roars with his 6 foot 3 frame like he’s auditioning for 300. He tears them both out of class. Everyone is super quiet. 

Five minutes later, he comes back with our stoner guy and we never ever saw the other guy ever again.</div>

So next time you’re anxious before something big, try telling yourself: “I’m excited.” It can actually shift your mindset and make you perform better.
Sounds simple, but it works and athletes, performers, and public speakers use it all the time.</div>

I lost my 15 year old girl (dog) in October 2022. Only advice I can offer here is to remember the positives, and not focus on the negatives (if any). He's done his job, keeping you safe and happy and loved, and it's his turn to rest.

You'll always miss him, you'll always remember him. You'll even go looking for him for the next few weeks (well, I did). There's a lot of habits that you're going to slowly stop, and that's ok. Changing your life to suit you is not forgetting him. Donating/throwing away his toys or blankets isn't forgetting him. There's no timeline on grief, and there's no timeline on moving on. Cry your tears.

I'm sorry you've reached the end of your journey. Words will never make this easier. Just keep your head up, and live the life he'd want you to.

This is a good time to live a little for you. I spent years looking after my girl as she got ill, and I sacrificed a lot of me and my time to keep her safe. If you feel you've done the same, take advantage of this time. Its ok to be happy and enjoy life without him. Life isn't over. Its just changing.

You'll be ok mate.

I'm so sorry.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah, I'm confused how this would get rid of mosquitos. Dunks kill larvae. The idea is to put them into bodies of water you can't drain to prevent more mosquitos.
If you already have mosquitos coming from elsewhere, how would this get rid of them? It seems like it would attract them to your breeding buckets.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This has worked great for me! To add to your suggestion: put a big stick in each bucket so that any critters that fall in can get back out. Otherwise you have a sad and nasty cleanup ahead of you! The best part about the mosquito dunks is that they are safe for use around pollinators, they'll just kill the mosquitoes at the larval stage. So no need to worry about the bees with this method!</div>

Every year, more chunks of Palestinian territory is eaten up, often the most profitable farmland, and Palestinians are chased out as they erect another military base in the middle of Palestinian territory and anyone who goes near is shot.

All the while billions of dollars and tons of equipment goes straight to Israel, instead of Ukraine where a lot of it was originally promised. This WH admin is an absolute disgrace.</div>

I strongly agree with this. Different cars are made with different purposes. When you buy a car, you're buying one car not the whole lineup from a manufacturer. The variance between models is much bigger than brand generality.

There are unreliable Honda's, there are reliable Hyundai's. In the modern age, it's really model by model rather than brand vs brand</div>
