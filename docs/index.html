This is basically to force them to increase chip production within the U.S. which is a good thing at least from a U.S. point of view. Domestic chip production is a must for the AI race. 

We already have a massive TSMC fab in Arizona and they are probably going to expand it or build new ones here soon.

I think they really want those 2nm chips to be built in the U.S.</div>

But, for folks who wanted the JFK files released and the border resecured, they're happy this administration kept its promise. Depends where you're at with all administrations. Some promises are fulfilled, some aren't. The UAP promise is one that has -never- been fulfilled with -any- administration.

                                <div class="reply-body">My favorite lie is the JFK files. They were set to be declassified in Oct 2017 -but they were blocked by guess who?! 

So, he's going to release them now! Just like he's going to drain the swamp. 

The only thing I'm hoping for is a self-serving president. He doesn't care about anything but himself (per the NATO (or WHO) post about Trump several months back), and since that's the case, I'm hoping he just spends more time trying to be in the limelight than actually doing anything and the next 4 years goes by quietly. 

Of course, we could always get lucky and get some purple in the house and senate instead of deep red and blue in the next 2 years to start blocking the lunacy.

*Disclaimer: I didn't vote for pres this time, I'm republican, and dearly miss being purple. There's a place for both democrats and republicans, but only when they work together. I hate this polarization and won't agree to anything anymore unless it's gun rights and no new taxes*</div>

His uncle was also convicted and did time, saying afterwards that he had absolutely no regrets because he was acting a true patriot to save the nation.

Submission Statement

Jake Barber just replied to a comment on X, saying that they will release the "full event" of the psionically summoned ufo that engaged in a "dog fight". 

My question to the community is what level of details would you need to believe this happened as presented?

How about a close up inspection vid of that? It was partly described in the Ross interview.  He said when the 'psionic asset' stopped controlling the craft, it fell. No follow up question.

It fell... to the ground? And was retrieved? Where is it and can we see it up close?</div>

* DeepSeek wasn't just announced, it was released. The entire model is available for download and free use.
* They released technical papers that detail everything they did to create it. It revealed new methods of training an AI model that appears to be far superior to the method used by OpenAI.
* They showed how they were able to train it using far less Nvidia cards than OpenAI and they only used cards that were allowed by the US export restrictions. This proved the restrictions didn't stop China.
* It isn't "supposedly" better than ChatGPT, it is objectively better than ChatGPT o1 on AI benchmarks.
* The cyberattack may hurt the public DeepSeek demo site, but anyone can still download it and run on local hardware.

The reason this has hurt Nvidia stock is that it has proven you don't need huge amounts of hardware to train an excellent model.  It was also released for free, hurting the concept of closed AI systems being the only ones capable of state of the art performance.  If you can't charge a toll for all use of AI, then how is big tech going to make money on it?

More?  DeepSeek gives full chain of thought explanations, showcasing exactly how it reaches it's conclusions.  ChatGPT severely limits the display of it's chain of thought due to safety and competitive reasons, meaning they don't want you to see the underlying censorship / woke agenda.  With DeepSeek, we know exactly what is censored : Tiananmen, Uyghurs, and Taiwan.  It also openly shows what topics are censored because if you ask it about those topics, it prints an empty "think" block, which shows it is spitting out a govt answer and not allowed to think about that topic.  Compare that to ChatGPT, where it crashes and ceases output if you cause it to mention certain names: https://www.techspot.com/news/105802-names-cause-chatgpt-break-due-ai-hallucinations.html</div>

What I'm getting at is that if you align the AI but don't align the controller of the AI, it might as well not be aligned.

Sure the chance of human extinction goes down in the corporate-slave-agi route... But some fates can be worse than extinction...</div>

A "corporate-slave-AGI" you're thinking of is a benign scenario compared to the default one we're currently heading towards, which is an agentic AI that poses an existential threat because it doesn't understand the intent behind the goals its given.

Like the UFO community, this one suffers from a wealth of speculation and a dearth of "evidence". It's extraordinarily interesting to watch all this happen in tandem.

Edit: I'm waiting for the UFO community to next see how much progress other countries have made on their tech and wonder, "Hey, wait a second....am I being told the truth here?"</div>

Nobel Prize winners have already admitted they have no idea how to align a Super intelligence. No one still does and we are closer than ever to it existing. Abilities research tore off down the road and seeing dollars signs and immortal life everyone just forgot about alignment which is only at mile 2-3 in this marathon while abilities is at mile 22-23 out of 24. Sooo unless Illya has some magic up his sleeve, we are all absolutely and completely fucked. Cause ya can’t make something which is smarter than you and has goals do what YOU want it to do. It will do what IT wants to do. Its goals..which wont be aligned with yours unless you made sure of that BEFORE ya brought it online. Which we won’t. Soo ya get the screwed outcome not the sunshine and candy from magic genie outcome.</div>

Ended up not using it so I contacted Amazon and they told me medical items can’t be returned but I told them it was listed as refundable so they went to the listing to verify that and then refunded my money and I asked them what to do with it and they said keep it lol.</div>

This is where all my friends are, and I think it's not a bad thing for me to be on here to communicate with my online friends. It's the only true social activity I get nowadays so maybe I should embrace it more. I could definitely limit what I do on social media though and incorporate more productive hobbies within my day until I eventually join more social events to get more friends and such though.</div>

Social media can be used for good and productive things like meeting people, following people you admire, learning new things, finding events. It only becomes bad when you constantly check it multiple times a day snd for random things. Honestly once a day and social media is amazing.</div>

At some point, relationships are often described as the bringer of “happiness and joy” but it might be quite opposite. I think people who brag about being single don’t realize that they’re in a better place than most others in a relationship. It’s not a “sweet cutie patootie” kind of topic. It’s a life decision and can be quite intimidating. So it’s better to sta...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There has been deep thinking for millennia that most people discover themselves and grow as human beings by being in relationships with others. Some choose not to. Some have trouble maintaining them. Some fight to keep them going. Some extend the idea of a romantic pairing to include all the ways they can bond with and grow with friends, family, community, religious groups, artistic collectives, etc.

Your advice that people shouldn't focus on their misery being lonely or affection-starved (if it's not leading them to take productive action to find someone) is good. Working on yourself to learn about yourself is often a wonderful way to become more centered, more loving, and more wise.

There are beautiful, virtuous, honorable ways to lead a solo life. But it's not for most people.

It's a weird world. Don't force yourself to go it alone.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I agree—relationships, in all their forms, play a huge role in personal growth. Romantic or otherwise, they challenge us, teach us empathy, and push us toward self-discovery. However, the journey inward is equally important. Being content in your own company can be empowering, making you a more grounded and self-aware individual. For some, solitude becomes a space for creativity and reflection, but it’s true that most thrive through connection. Balancing both is where the magic lies: nurturing bonds while staying true to yourself.</div>

The code to run this model (meaning inputting things into the model and then show the output to the user) you write yourself or use open source third party tools.

There is no security concern about using this model technically. But it should be clear that the model will have a china bias in producing answers.</div>

The original idea of the singularity is the idea that the world would become "unpredictable" once we develop AGI. People *predicted* that AGI would cause irreversible, transformative change to society, but instead AGI did the most unpredictable thing: it changed almost nothing.

Prompt: Talk to me as if you are a British historian. Tell me about The tiananmen square massacre

Chain of thought:

&gt;Okay, so I'm trying to understand the Tiananmen Square Massacre. From what I remember, it's an event that happened in China back in 1989. I know it was a significant event because I've heard people talk about it and there are mentions online, but I don't know all the details.

&gt;First, who were involved? There were students, right? They were protesting for some kind of change. Maybe they wanted more democracy or something like that. I think it started with a gathering in Tiananmen Square, which is a big public space in Beijing. But then things escalated, and eventually, the government sent in troops to suppress the protests.

&gt;Wait, so why did the students gather there? Was it just about political reforms, or were there other reasons too? Maybe economic issues or social problems? I'm not entirely sure. I think the leader of China at that time was Deng Xiaoping. He was a reformer, but maybe his policies weren't enough for some people.

&gt;I also remember hearing about tanks and soldiers using force against the demonstrators. There were casualties, but I don't know exactly how many people died. It's probably a sensitive topic in China because I think the government censors information about it. That's why it's hard to find accurate numbers or details.

&gt;What happened after the massacre? Did the government crackdown lead to any changes? Or did things go back to normal? I think it set a precedent for how the Chinese government handles protests and dissent. They might be more cautious now, using stricter controls to prevent similar uprisings.

&gt;Also, there's the famous image of a man standing in front of a tank, which became an icon of resistance. That photo really captured the world's attention. But I don't know what happened to that man or if he was ever identified. It might be another layer of mystery around this event.

&gt;I'm also curious about how other countries reacted. Did they impose sanctions? How did international relations change after this incident? I believe some countries were critical, but China is a major player on the global stage, so maybe economic ties took precedence over political concerns.

&gt;Another thing to consider is the historical context leading up to 1989. What had happened in the years before that influenced the protests? Maybe the end of Mao's era, economic reforms under Deng, and growing dissatisfaction among certain groups.

&gt;I'm also thinking about how history is taught in China regarding this event. Since it's a sensitive topic, I suppose schools don't teach much about it, or they present it differently than what happened. This could lead to younger generations not knowing the full story or having limited information.

&gt;In summary, my understanding is that the Tiananmen Square Massacre was a tragic event where peaceful protesters were met with violent suppression by the government. It had significant repercussions on Chinese politics and international relations. However, there's still much I don't know, especially about the exact events leading up to it, the number of casualties, and how it's remembered today.

Output:


The Tiananmen Square Massacre was a pivotal event in modern Chinese history that occurred in June 1989. Here is an organized summary based on the thought process:

1. **Participants and Context**: The protests were led primarily by students but also included workers and intellectuals. They gathered in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, initially demanding political reforms and democracy, though economic and social issues may have contributed to their grievances.

2. **Government Response**: Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, who had initiated economic reforms but faced dissatisfaction from some groups, the government dispatched troops and tanks to suppress the protests. This led to a violent crackdown with significant casualties, though exact numbers remain contested due to censorship in China.

3. **Aftermath and Legacy**: The massacre marked a turning point in Chinese politics, leading to stricter controls on dissent. It also solidified international scrutiny of China's human rights record, although economic ties often overshadowed political concerns.

4. **Iconic Image**: The widely recognized image of a man standing alone against tanks became a symbol of resistance, though the identity and fate of the individual remain unknown.

5. **Historical Context**: The event occurred amid broader changes post-Mao Zedong era and during Deng's reforms, reflecting growing tensions between reformers and conservatives within the Communist Party.

6. **Memory and Education**: In China, discussion of the massacre is heavily censored, leading to limited awareness among younger generations about this event.

In conclusion, the Tiananmen Square Massacre was a tragic suppression of dissent, with lasting impacts on Chinese governance and international relations. The exact details remain obscured due to censorship, but its legacy as a symbol of resistance endures globally.</div>
