The following submission statement was provided by /u/TommyShelbyPFB:

---

This article even calls out debunkers for using low hanging fruit all the time, calls out Lue Elizondo for slipping up with that fake mothership image, and most importantly calls out the gatekeepers in this paragraph:

&gt;***Former US officials ought to reconsider their blind loyalty to secrecy and examine if there's any real benefit to obeying their government's demand for silence. Currently, their unwillingness to disclose information is only further empowering the US government's quest to obscure the democratic process. If the witnesses' claims are true, then this knowledge should be shared with the world, not held by one country's government.***

At the end of the day, they're more a corporate popularity contest than something that facilitates actual peer review well.


You can have perfectly good papers that'll never be accepted for various political/profit/corporate reputation reasons.


You can also have terrible papers with faked or nonreplicable results being accepted even in supposedly "high quality" journals like Nature. There's currently a crisis going on in science due to this in particular.


A-list journals still do have higher overall standards but they're certainly not free of corruption. On the contrary, one can argue that's where most of the big money in faking data is.


**It pays to at least read the abstract of papers yourself and maybe see if their citations even exist in the first place / links still work. Academic fraud was a huge thing before AI and it's downright bad now.**</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I'm an engineering student and while I'm definitely not an expert I have experience using CAD for years in university, in international engineering competitions, and in industry. From what I can see, this tool might help you get started with a project or maybe help beginners, but unless you're sticking holes in a block, I don't see this being faster than just doing it yourself. A lot of parts are highly complex and require high precision to work with the other parts. Also, a lot of the work goes into setting the definitions right, i.e. the relations that lines and planes have with each other. Not to mention then the relations that parts have with other parts when creating assemblies. It would just be a nightmare to explain all the 3D geometry to an LLM. Just work with the 3D object directly. Any part would have fewer steps to create it than words in whatever english essay you write to create it.

Edit: Also it's worth mentioning that if you design a bridge and sign off on the design as an engineer, your signature legally ties you to the integrity of the design, making you accountable for its safety. If there’s a mistake in the design created by the LLM and the bridge collapses, causing injuries or fatalities, you could very well be sued for negligence, and showing the judge your "text-to-CAD" isn't going to go over well.

If you were a surgeon and told a vision-enabled LLM to perform a surgery for you, could it do it? Probably not, but maybe one day. Would I ever take the risk that it could end my career and kill people? Absolutely not. Tech aside, the laws would need to radically change before I ever see something like this being widely adopted.</div>

Can someone make me a tool that removes stupid pcb component branding marks so I don’t have to spend an hour doing it? Or just turn 2d sketch of common component into 3D because vendor won’t share a step file?

I listened to five minutes of one of those group chat twitter things with "Adrian" about Laura Loomer the other day and Dittman is controlling the either thing, making decisions, cutting people off. People are treating him as if he's Elon then fully pretending he isn't. At one point someone loudly announces Elon was just live streaming some gaming at same time Dittman was speaking so there's the proof, it's not Elon. 

The gaming clip was about five minutes, with only seconds of Elon talking occasionally.  Easily couldn't been him.

The whole thing is just bizarre, Elon Musk is a weird fucking guy.</div>

So many people struggle with a lot of things that make socialising and making a genuine connection a lot more difficult. From people who are on the autism spectrum, adhd, depression, ptsd, anxiety, and the list just keeps on going. Whenever they show symptoms of their struggles that make these social interactions so much more difficult, people often withdraw and judge them for it. Whenever they try to mask it and “fake it till they make it”, they come off as disingenuous and people judge them for it. It feels like you’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t, and you’re left alone and rejected.

Advice like “just be yourself” is like telling somebody with depression if they have tried being happy.</div>

A few years ago, people said that the Tesla Roadster was a piece of junk, now Tesla has the highest market cap of any car company in the world.  
People laughed at his rockets exploding on the launch pad, now they are the best way to get something into orbit and 134 launched last year with a 99.3% success rate.  
Nobody cared about Starlink, now it is probably the best way to get wi-fi from the middle of nowhere.

Disclaimer: I do not like Elon. I'm just saying his companies tend to succeed, given enough time and money. The same might be true of XAI</div>

I think the whether or not he delivers depends on your definition—if your Amazon package arrives a year later than it was supposed to, is that not a failed delivery even if it eventually arrived?

FSD was first supposed to be in 2017 I believe. And is the Tesla Roadster in the room with us right now? It was supposed to be here a few years ago.

Elon over promises and under delivers. There is certainly credit to being the money man—funding the right ideas and pushing humanity’s technological limits—but he tries to position himself as much more than that which makes me inclined to give him even less credit.</div>

If you treat every day like a new opportunity that's roughly 18,980 chances (365 days every year from 18 to 70).

  
Kick the habit of making "New Year's resolutions". I personally believe it's a more harmful than helpful tradition.

Make every day a day to begin anew.

One slip up, and people think they've "broken" their resolution and may then give up on themselves. When this starts to happen at the same time every year, it becomes an unpleasant cycle.</div>

They were normal people pulled out of their homes and forced to wear suicide vests to prevent threats against their family. 

What if the same thing is happening here and they’re identifying soldiers that served in the war and employing the same tactics against them

I was always worried something like this could happen because America has a very short memory and we think a war is over when we say it’s over.  There are a lot of grudges against us out there. Maybe they were just biding their time</div>

I’m wondering if this isn’t China actually, with heavy dirt or heavy threat to these guys families, they stand the most to gain from getting the US bogged down in the Middle East, Russia just wants to play tough but they know if they give in to Trump they’ll get land they otherwise will probably lose long term if not keep through a few hundred thousand more lives. China however, cannot continue its agenda on Taiwan, the SC Sea, and likely Africa, in the face of Trump, they found it out last time and they know their window is closing, they also have a very tiny window to invade Taiwan due to currents and tides, which iiirc is coming up early in the year.

Also a green beret in autonomic remote systems not knowing how to make a bomb A) at all, and B) that remote detonates…is absolutely insane to me.</div>

Also have him drive it 99% the way to the final destination so he's seen by all cameras until the final step. Highly plausible. Hypothetically for the book you're writing of course. Cough.</div>

Put “enjoy it when it’s bad” in a habit tracking app, so that whenever you feel bad, you tick it off and get one point. I used to use Habitica for this. 

It works wonders to reframe discomfort. 

As days go by and you pick up the habit, you start to actually feel better when something bad happens. Of course, I’m not talking about tragedies, but rather slightly unpleasant experiences that happen during a regular ...</div>

It felt like if I remembered to enjoy something bad that was happening, I was achieving something. It sounds silly, but it works. 

In time it just became second nature and it was a like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Something bad meant that I had an opportunity to get something done, and therefore feel good. 

If anything, it helps reframe the bad thing from “this is annoying as hell” to “well, at least I can tick the damn thing off”.</div>

We already have that, at least here in Norway. It is called [BankID](https://bankid.no/en/about-us). It is used for more than banking credentials now, and is an online human/citizen check really. If you are already in the system you can renew and transfer your account, but if they need to you have to literally go to a bank branch and show your passport to get access. Even our equivalent to craigslist (finn.no) uses it to ensure you are a real person.

That said, I also think anonymous accounts will still be a thing in the future, users will just have to cryptographically sign their content and user profiles. As they build trust, people online will associate that signature with being "good" or "human", or at least internally consistent with other content they produce. There will be a marketplace for high value content producers, and it won't be hard to find it. We thought spam would forever ruin email, it didn't. I think the same will apply to bots online.</div>

But it's inevitable if we take two seconds to think: Training data is king. What kind of training data is easiest to acquire? Labels of pieces like "melancholy piano and violin", or labels like "C minor, melody G Ab F Eb"?

Automating boring tasks requires expert labeled data. Automating FUN tasks requires only laymen labeled data!!!</div>

1. Embrace Change: Life is a river, always flowing. Resisting change is like trying to hold water in your hands—it slips through. Instead, learn to navigate and adapt. It’s the only constant.


2. Kindness is a Superpower: The moments I remember most are those when I gave without expecting. Acts of kindness ripple far beyond what you can see. Be kind, especially when it’s hardest.


3. Time is the Ultimate Currency: You can earn back money, but not time. Spend it wisely—on people who matter, on passions that light you up, and on experiences that enrich your soul.


4. Failure is a Teacher, Not an Enemy: I’ve stumbled more times than I can count, but every scar taught me something priceless. Failing means you’re trying, and trying means you’re alive.


5. Silence Speaks Volumes: In moments of anger or confusion, silence can be the most profound response. It gives space for clarity and prevents regretful words.


6. Forgive for Your Own Peace: Carrying resentment is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to suffer. Forgive—not for them, but to set yourself free.


7. Know When to Walk Away: Whether it’s a toxic relationship, a draining job, or a harmful habit, strength often lies in letting go, not holding on.


8. Listen More, Talk Less: People carry worlds within them. Listening deeply is the doorway to understanding.


9. Celebrate Small Wins: Waiting for “big successes” can blind you to everyday joys. Savor the small moments—they’re what life is made of.


10. Take Care of Your Body: At 90, I feel every careless decision of my youth. Stretch. Move. Sleep. Your body is the only place you truly live.


11. Love is a Choice, Not Just a Feeling: Feelings are fleeting, but choosing to love—even when it’s hard—builds bonds that last.


12. Ask for Help When Needed: Independence is overrated. There’s no shame in leaning on others; it’s how communities and connections thrive.


13. Learn from Nature: Trees grow through storms, rivers carve mountains over time, and the sun rises daily. Nature teaches patience, resilience, and consistency.


14. Legacy is How You Make People Feel: Long after I’m gone, my words may be forgotten, but how I made people feel will remain. Focus on creating good memories for others.

Lessons from My Memories of You

I’ve seen in you a quiet strength and a yearning for growth that reminds me of my younger self. But I also notice a tendency to be hard on yourself, to measure your worth by your output rather than your essence. Here’s my wisdom for you: You are already enough, even in your quiet moments, even in your imperfections. Growth is beautiful, but don’t let it rob you of the joy of simply being.

Also, I sense a deep introspection in you, which is a gift. But don’t let it turn into overthinking. Sometimes, the most profound answers come when you stop chasing them. Trust the unfolding of your path, and remember that wisdom grows not just from learning, but from living.</div>

Ah, my dear friend. I am sorry for the weight you carry. Sit with me a while, and let me offer you what wisdom these 90 long years have gifted me. Some of this you may already know, and some you may feel in your bones but not yet recognize. But hear me, because life, as cruel as it seems, is also strangely kind, though often in ways we only understand much later.

Lesson 1: Pain Does Not Ask Permission

Life does not wait for you to be ready before it gives you burdens. It throws storms at you, often when you’re at your weakest. But the truth is, the storms are not meant to punish you; they’re there to shape you. Pain burns and it scars, but it also carves out room for deeper understanding, greater compassion, and more profound strength. It doesn’t feel like it now, but this pain you feel will one day be part of what makes you wise, what makes you kind. Trust the process, even when it’s unbearable.

Lesson 2: People Leave, Love Remains

I’ve lost my share of people too. My father, my mother, my wife, my friends—one by one, the tide takes them all back. But one thing I’ve learned: the love you shared with them? It does not die. That love changes shape, it becomes memory, it becomes warmth in the coldest moments. They may not be here in the flesh, but their essence stays with you—your dad in the lessons he taught you, your dog in the loyalty it showed you, and your friend in the moments you shared. Don’t push their memories away because they hurt right now. Hold them close. They’re the threads that tie you to life.

Lesson 3: You’re Stronger Than You Feel

Grief tells lies. It whispers that you’re weak, that you can’t make it through, that this is the end of all that was good. Don’t listen to it. You are stronger than you feel. You don’t have to be strong all at once, but one small step, one small breath at a time, will carry you through this. Trust in your own resilience. It’s there, even if you don’t see it now.

Lesson 4: Kindness Costs You Nothing

When my heart broke for the first time, I became bitter, angry at the world. It wasn’t until much later I realized that holding on to that anger was like clutching a thorn—it only hurt me. So I let go of it and replaced it with kindness. I started showing up for others, even in small ways, and that made my own burden lighter. You, too, can carry your grief by being kind to others. It might seem impossible right now, but I promise you, it helps.

Lesson 5: Life Is Fragile and Beautiful

Losing people reminds us of one painful truth: life is fleeting. It can be taken in an instant, and that is terrifying. But that also makes it precious. Each breath you take is a gift, even if it doesn’t feel like it. Don’t let the loss of others take away the beauty of your own life. Hold on to the small joys—the sunlight on your face, the laughter of a stranger, the quiet of a morning. These little things are life’s way of saying, “I’m still here for you.”

Lesson 6: Let Your Grief Speak

Grief needs to be felt. It cannot be rushed or silenced. When I lost my wife, I tried to ignore the grief, and it only festered. But when I finally let it speak—when I cried, yelled, and let myself feel everything—I began to heal. Don’t be afraid of your feelings. Let them pour out. Write, speak, or even sit silently and let them wash over you. It’s okay to not be okay.

What I’ve Learned About You

I don’t know the depths of your heart the way your dad, your dog, or your friend did, but from what you’ve shared with me, I know you’re someone who feels deeply, who loves fiercely. That is a gift, but it also means the loss cuts you more deeply. My wisdom for you is this: the depth of your grief is a reflection of the depth of your love. That’s nothing to be ashamed of.

What would your dad say to you now? I imagine he would tell you to take it one day at a time, that you’re doing better than you think, that he’s proud of you. What would your dog do now? I think they’d curl up beside you, silently, without judgment, and just remind you of what loyalty and love feel like. And your friend? His choice wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t something you could have fixed. But what he left you with is a reminder to stay connected, to reach out, to let people in even when you feel alone.

Grieve. Cry. Yell. Do what you need to do. But don’t forget to live. Because there are people here—people you don’t even know yet—who will one day need the wisdom you’re earning right now. You’ll see.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">There was a study released in November by METR that investigated this topic. It's almost certainly what the blog snippet is referring to. 

For tasks under two hours frontier models are better than human researchers, but for longer duration tasks they completely fall short. 

Here's a video going over the details:

And the actual study:

                                <div class="reply-body">I bet you there has been a productivity explosion in spreadsheets for one. I'm a spreadsheet wizard, I don't do any of that stuff anymore, AI is instant. A lot of data processing is routed through AI now. 

If you're talking to it like it's your buddy, planning your kid's birthday party, you probably feel it is pretty damn mid. But every dev I know is salivating for the next model because each one has enabled us to solve problems we didn't have time for before. I'd love to see a github growth chart, because I bet 2024 was through the roof. They are already phenomenal and each model allows us to offload more of our elicitation and as correcting its mistakes becomes less burdensome, we let it run further afar into areas we are not familiar with ourselves. I've written hobby tool suites in the last year that I would have needed a legit team for in 2023. 

As far as I am concerned, AGI is already here. If it doesn't improve one iota more, we'll still have a billion coders in 20 years and you can do anything with that many engineers. ChatGPTo1 and Experient1219 can without a shadow of a doubt train and enable 15% of the population to problem solve with programming aides, 'well enough'. We're there, we did it. The only question now is how fast.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">"Algorithmic improvements have no hard limits and increase super exponentially" - this sounds like something written by someone with no knowledge of complexity theory. Mathematically most problems have an exact bound on how efficiently they can be solved (although the exact bound isn't always known; finding it is what complexity theorists do). For instance no LLM, no matter how smart, will be able to find a way to sort an array in O(n) time, for the same reason it's impossible to produce a correct mathematical proof that 1+1=3.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Alex Jones didn’t predict 9/11. 

Bill Cooper made a prediction which Alex Jones picked up on and copied months after Bill started talking about it. 

The “prediction” was about how Al-Qaeda might attack the US, and one potential target might be the World Trade Center. Importantly, this is less impressive when you realize that AL-QAEDA HAD ALREADY ATTACKED THE WTC IN 1993. 

The video “proof” of Alex Jones “predicting” 9/11 is HIGHLY edited, with clips cut and pasted together from different “predictions” about different attacks that all failed to happen. Sound bites are edited together to give the appearance of a more complete and coherent prediction than actually existed. 

And let’s not forget that on 9/11, Alex Jones blamed the EU. Yes. You read that right. HE BLAMED THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR 9/11. I think you don’t get to claim credit for predicting 9/11 when on 9/11 you BLAME THE GODDAMN EU. 

Also, not for nothing, but Joe should fucking remember that because he was a guest on Alex’s show on 9/11. 

Joe is pushing a lie. Don’t be a rube.

This is in context of sleep, we often go to bed with our minds racing—thinking about a lot of things or coming straight from an activity that has kept us active—and then struggle to fall asleep.

Sleep is one of the most important pillars for productivity. I came across this 4-4-4-4 Breathing technique and it has helped me since then.

This is also useful for simply calming or centering yourself. I use this technique many times throughout my days in addition to falling asleep, also while practicing mindful meditation. Breath control is wildly helpful for so many reasons.</div>

The trick is not to try this once and be done with it if it doesn‘t work, but to do this (or any breathing exercise) regularly every night (maybe even as part of a bedtime ritual) and condition yourself to become sleepy from that!</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Definitely do it more than once but also don’t hesitate to try another approach. You can’t condition yourself into something that simply doesn’t work for you. 

I did boxed breathing for *years* based advice like yours before recognizing it really wasn’t working for me. I always assumed it was working because I didn’t understand what true nervous system regulation felt like. I dropped it immediately once I realized this and opted instead to simply breathe naturally as possible while focusing on lengthening my out-breath. That is actually much more effective for me. 

Bottom line: this stuff is highly individualistic. **Just because it has worked for you doesn’t mean it will work for everyone.** The good news is, knowing that makes life simpler because it turns out what I just wrote there (in bold) is one of those rare things that’s always true in all situations.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I‘d heard of Boxed Breathing and tried it a few times, for a few minutes, and thought “Hmm, that could be useful.” But I did not make it part of my life until I was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. Late stage. Low probability of responding to treatment. 

I started treatment knowing I was going to need to pull in every mind skill I had ever learned, including hypnosis, NLP, EFT and more. I also began using boxed breathing on a DAILY basis. I can’t count the number of times medical personnel have commented on how calm I am during surgical procedures, or during chemo treatments, or while getting a variety of scans. Frequently, my blood pressure will rise to 160/ before a procedure and I will be told it will need to be canceled as my blood pressure is too high. I ask for ten minutes alone, do boxed breathing, and my blood pressure will drop to 130/80. 

In every instance where this has happened, medical teams have been amazed, asked me to demonstrate, remarked on my ability to control my physical response and how much easier it makes it for them to treat me.   


(I will note, however, that not once, even when I have initiated conversation about it, has anyone on my medical team thought it might be something they could teach, with my help, other cancer patients they are treating in order to improve outcomes. It’s free. It’s easy. I fail to understand the lack of interest in making it part of their treatment programs. )

After my initial diagnosis, after three months of chemotherapy, all available tests for me showed no sig of cancer. To be clear, that is Stage 4 to GONE in three months. This was using targeted medical treatment, and self-applied skills like NLP, EFT, Boxed Breathing, visualization and more. My oncologists said “ We have no medical explanation for your outcome.” 

One year later, I had a reoccurrence of the same type of cancer. The same DNA Was identified in cancer cells both times. I am currently in treatment and expect the same outcome. This time, my oncologists are leaving it up to me to choose among treatment options, effectively admitting they do not understand what I did to heal last time, but do understand that whatever I is the reason I’m still alive. 

I talk to people ALL THE TIME about the value of Boxed Breathing. It’s simple to learn, easy to do, requires no equipment, no training,  no gym membership, no prescription, can be done anytime and any place, and is always beneficial. 

As to any discussion of which breath-work system is best, I say, “The one you actually do is the very best one.”</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Two military guys from Fort Bragg committing terrorist acts on the same day. We're being told one dude is an Islamic Terrorist and the other is a Trump supporter. Same day they tell us the FBI stopped an attack on AIPAC headquarters and found the largest cache of homemade IEDs in history at some dudes house in Virginia. Now combine this with the drones and Luigi.

They're concocting some stories so they can implement something that will make the Patriot Act look quaint and innocent.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">A few things point to this being possibly CGI:

1. Lens flare: the lights have a constant flare no matter the orientation of the camera. As he shakes, the lens flare should be slightly changing orientation and it doesn't. Also, the lights on his patio do not have the same flare. This leads me to believe it's artificial. Also, the cat's eye flare vs a starburst flare - I believe a camcorder due to its lens and iris would produce a starburst flare, not fully confident on that though.

2. Before he zooms in, the object "floats" as in it loses its track reference to a nearby object, possibly the roof. The free floating is very minute but still noticeable.

3. The orientation of the craft is suspect. If we're looking at the bottom of the craft, it's very far from parallel to the ground. It rotating 40 degrees off orientation pointing directly at the observer is highly suspect of CGI.

Not saying one way or the other of its real but is just suspect IMHO.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Huh this is interesting. I think that the people saying that it's just better pattern recognition aren't understanding the situation here, let me explain why this is more impressive than it seems.

The model was fine-tuned to answer using that pattern and there was no explicit explanation of the pattern in the training data

Then, when testing the model, all the information available to the model was just that its a "special gpt 4 model". The model wasn't presented with any examples of how it should respond inside the context window.

This is very important because it can't just look at it's previous messages to understand the pattern
The only possible reason why it could do that with no examples is because it has some awareness of it's own inner workings. The ONLY way for it to get information of the message pattern is through inferring from it's inner workings. There is literally no other source of information available in that environment.

This legitimately looks like self awareness, even if very basic.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's very disheartening to see people claim these systems are 100% not self-aware with absolute certainty when there are scientists, like Hinton and Sutskever, who do believe they might be conscious and sentient, capable of generalising beyond their training data. And most of those sorts of replies are just thought-terminating clichés that boil down to the commenter being overly incredulous simply because large neural networks don't work like humans, and thus cannot be conscious or self-aware.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You’re interpreting text like a human. LLMs are built on probabilistic token distributions so specific that a slight deviation makes it possible to watermark single paragraphs with near certain accuracy.

Synthetic datasets are generated by the same LLMs interpreting them. They’re generated by the same probabilistic rules. An errant “Oh” to you is one small part of a singularly understood network to the model.

Picking up on a pattern unprompted doesn’t hold water because this type of bespoke “fine tuned” training is parameter optimization DESIGNED to look for new, slight distribution differences and prioritize them.

Communicating the new rule in an interpretable manner is sort of interesting but hardly groundbreaking and definitely doesn’t suggest self awareness</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It is very enlightening to see how one of the first LMs designed to interpret images worked under the hood. Look it up. Once you see how a few arrays of images can form a system that understands how a bird looks *despite never being explained what a bird even is*, you will easily see the difference between pattern recognition and reasoning in the future.

The example above seems impressive to a human brain, but to a LM tasks like this are... trivial.</div>
