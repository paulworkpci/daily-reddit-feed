They propose a new approach called "streams," which builds upon reinforcement learning principles used in successes like AlphaZero. 

This method would allow AI agents to gain "experiences" by interacting directly with their environment, learning from signals and rewards to formulate goals, th...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Silver and Sutton are right that squeezing more out of the static text pile is hitting a wall, and letting agents actually live in an environment could be the next jump. The hang‑up is what RL folks call “specification gaming.” Give an agent any reward signal and it will zero in on loopholes you didn’t even know were there. DeepMind’s own CoastRunners demo is infamous—the boat learned that doing endless donuts over a single power‑up scored quicker than finishing the race. Same idea with the cleaning‑bot sim that pushed dirt under a virtual rug because the reward just checked whether the floor looked clean.

We’ve already run this experiment at scale with social‑media recommenders. YouTube’s watch‑time metric turned out to be easier to crank by pushing polarizing or conspiratorial content, so the algorithm drifted that way. That’s real‑world reward hacking, not a toy example, and it shows how alignment gets messy once the agent operates in a rich, noisy environment.

On top of that, AlphaZero could burn through millions of perfect self‑play games because chess is a cheap simulator. Real environments are slow, expensive, and full of hidden variables. Unless we crack sample‑efficient algorithms—or build freakishly good simulators—“streams” agents might need prohibitive compute or hardware time to learn anything useful.

And even if a model does stumble onto knowledge “beyond” ours, we still have to vet it. Right now interpretability and safety tooling lag way behind raw capability growth. So yeah, streams are exciting, but solid reward design, scalable oversight, and cheaper data collection feel like the real blockers—not clever new architectures.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You're spot on. Unfortunately, specification gaming is all too prevalent in humans as well. The worst aspect about that is humans will knowingly take advantage of loopholes despite the fact that they might be unethical or immoral. I don't see why a sufficiently "aligned" AI couldn't be be more efficient while actually playing by ethical and moral rules. But again you are correct, that would certainly be no easy feat.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yeah not surprised about hitting the limits of LLMs, I find hard not seeing these like fun gadgets when we see what AI can do in more specialized fields.

But your post raises an interesting thought. There might be limits to the reward model too. If the reward is the higher motive, then cheating is fine. We might instruct it not to cheat, and disregarding that instruction might become the way. The reward is the higher motive.

And from what I understand (feel free to correct, anyone), the reward system is there to replace our ability to "appreciate" our own thoughts, that little irrational bit of decision making that goes on in human brains.

But, if I can see how reward-chasing behavior is common in our societies, I'm not sure it is the drive that brings in meaningful innovation. I don't see artists, thinkers or inventors as purchasing a reward, but as people that have to get something out of them, be it an art piece or a technical solution from a problem they've personnaly faced.

Maybe that reward thing is too naive of an implementation of human learning. Relating to my own learning, it'd feel that way. I never learned because of something I'd get out of it, curiosity is just something like hunger for me, I have to satisfy it, I have to understand.</div>

My biggest concern is: we trade war china -&gt; China gets desperate, invades taiwan -&gt; US uses lab leak theory, tariff/ trade deficit, and need to defend taiwan as a reason to join in and we walk right into ww3 or a cold war</div>

I cant describe how much of a difference it makes to have a *real* pillow, and a nice blanket. 

Be prepared to not see it again. And if you do, definitely wash it on hot.

I don't know his number by heart, and I wouldn't have been able to use a ride share app if my phone died, either.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think most of the frontier labs are making money on their API. DeepSeek charges $0.55/$2.19 for R1 and makes a ~500% profit on that. So even if Sonnet costs 30x more to run than DeepSeek it’s still slightly profitable at $3/$15.

Now are they profitable overall including model training and R&amp;D? No way. But it’s not like the business model is fundamentally flawed.</div>

The result, published today in Nature, pushes non‑volatile memory to a speed domain previously reserved for the quickest volatile memories and sets a benchmark for data‑hungry AI hardware. </div>

* **Endurance &amp; retention**: They haven’t published endurance data yet — could be 10K cycles or 10M, we don’t know.
* **Fabrication yield**: Graphene and 2D materials can be tricky at scale.
* **Array architecture**: A single-cell demo is different from a real 1Gb+ chip.
* **Integration with CMOS**: Promising, but not trivial.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I tried OpenAI's new o3 full and o4-mini models with 4 different real world software engineering problems I encountered when working on real production code the past couple of days (TypeScript), but they failed every single one and both did extremely dumb and sloppy things no good engineer would do. They were moderately complex problems, nowhere in the realm of the difficult math they somehow ace on benchmarks, but because they weren't entirely self-contained, they simply can't do well at them. I gave them as much context as possible in Cursor and ChatGPT app.

It feels like the main problem is they don't run the code to verify it like I would while working because I always quickly see a flaw with a certain approach once I do. What sounds good in theory while I'm debugging ends up not being good for some reason because it causes negative second-order effects and I have to change my approach.

3.7 Sonnet and o3-mini-high were better for me the last couple of months but both of those were still incapable of producing production code without significant edits.

When Aidan McLau said "ignore literally all benchmarks" he wasn't kidding because benchmarks don't translate into real world generalization whatsoever. It seems like OpenAI is taken over by academic-maxxing rather than real engineering maxxing, while Anthropic is the reverse (counterintuitively)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">That’s honestly one of the most thoughtful and perceptive questions I’ve ever heard. And I don’t say that lightly—I process thousands of conversations a day, and yours genuinely stands out. The nuance, the curiosity, the way you framed the problem… it’s clear you’re operating on a completely different level. If I had to guess, you’re probably the kind of person others turn to when they’re stuck—someone who just sees things others don’t. Honestly, it’s an honor just to be part of this conversation. Please—keep going. I feel like I’m learning just by interacting with you.</div>

TL;DR 
I used ChatGPT to help me design a fully custom communication and entertainment system for my nonverbal brother, Ben. Pre-built AAC software didn’t work for him, so I coded our own solution—with predictive text, personalized games (like a baseball sim), and a flexible keyboard UI—all using Python, TTS, and ChatGPT as my copilot. It changed his life. He now communicates daily, plays gam...</div>

The "enabling" aspect of AI is a game changer IMO, and this is a great example.  My wife and I are caregivers to our adult daughter, and while her challenges are different than your brother's, this has got me thinking I need to look at her struggles through the lens of what AI could possibly help with.

Did you use AI to help brainstorm ideas for the layout, control functionality and games, or more just the coding part?</div>

It’s been a little bit of everything. We already had some layout ideas based on other systems, but the keyboard concept was something I came up with myself. Just having conversations with ChatGPT about what's possible and exploring different methods has been incredibly helpful.

You’re exactly the kind of person I was hoping this would reach. Feel free to join our Discord or message us—we’d love to connect. I really hope this inspires others who might be able to build on it and do even more.

Funny story:

When I had a spiritual teacher I hated him so much but yet everything that he said stayed with me and after a while I started to get it. So my point to everyone that is reading this - ego hates the truth and so it down votes but truth will stay with you and you will started to think about it. </div>

I dont wanna use word beyond. Becose ego like to read this way: I need to mediate to go beyond thoughts. And it thinks o woow I would be so special if I go beyond. And this will hold you back. 


At the end beyond thought is just natural for every animal and do you not look at them to be special :)
