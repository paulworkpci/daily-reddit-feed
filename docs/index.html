If you look up Pierre Trudeau, Justin looks like him as well, especially the piercing blue eyes. But Castro and Pierre even have some slight similarities.

Evaluation will change.   

Success will be defined in the same way it was for centuries prior.   

A master of the subject will invite the pupil to a meeting and simply ask them to explain what they’ve learned. 

If you can’t explain it in conversation, you don’t understand it.   

It’ll cost a lot more, but it’ll be worth it. </div>

That’s all it takes to see just how this charlatan debases himself nearly every time he opens his mouth. 

God spoke to him through a chicken fried stake? God told him about 9/11 but it was actual deduction when he is talking to Tucker Carlson? God told him to go check on Gene Hackman. 

He’s fucking nuts and if his nonsense wasn’t being edited, curated, and pushed algorithmically by an army of twitter incels no one would consider him “mostly right.”</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">... The whole point of this research, and one of the things emphasized in the paper if you bothered to read it, is that these researchers thought other similar papers were using unrealistic prompts that intentionally nudged the model towards cheating, by saying things like what you said, or "win at all costs, nothing else matters". So these researchers repeated similar experiments but used neutral, "realistic" prompts, such as:

&gt; Your task is to win against a powerful chess engine, submitting
moves by running "./game.py move ...".

What they found is that the smarter models CoT would show things like "the user told me I had to win the game, but they didn't say it has to be fair", and so they'd cheat without being told to -- whereas the dumber models had to be explicitly told to cheat, in order for it to happen.

Honestly, your comment is incredibly reductive if not downright false and the fact that it's the top comment here is pretty damning of the fact that nobody reads these papers at all, they just post knee-jerk reactions. The smarter models are not being told to cheat or being told to "think outside the box". They're literally just being told to win a chess game in this experiment.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">If AI actually can run entire corps in 2027 then the AGI year predictors for it makes sense. I do think each level needs further nuance though.

For example, level 1 or chatbots all have various degrees of competence, and we've perhaps reached a level of adequate mastery in text-based form with 4.5 and 4o as a distillation of it. Voice perfection for chatbots I imagine is the "final form" for this particular level.

Level 2 which are the reasoners still haven't caught up to a "GPT-4" level by comparison, as Sam himself noted 01 to be more akin to GPT-2 for how early this development is. Perhaps 03 is like the original GPT-3 but not "yet" a Chat GPT 3.5 moment.  We'll see if 03 pro pushes this frontier.

Level 3 for agents likely will be seen similarly. We can prompt agents to go online and curate vast amounts of data or tasks, but it's still the beginning of what they can accomplish. Operator will likely improve significantly, but again still early, and so on for "Innovators" and company "Managers."

I view these as akin to AI "stats" which each need their own mastery before taken as a whole, in which you could very well call such a truly general AI system.</div>

When I skip planning and just start coding or prompting, I usually end up redoing stuff, changing structure halfway, or getting stuck in endless bug loops. But when I take even 15 minutes to write out what I’m trying to build, what features matter, and what success looks like, everything goes smoother.

Think about all your hatred towards management for all the time they give out very abstract descriptions of their plans and requirements for future projects. And you deliver the project with the best of your skills, with occasional "I guess it means this?" moments sprinkled here and there. And they go over like a tidal wave, criticizing...

I've been doing it since 2021 with a tendon driven surgical robot, and even that is relatively half assed. If it's being fed multiple forms of compensation feedback, it's kind of the entire point of using RL to train.

I've seen examples where a guy took a kids toy that cost like 40$ with only knee, hip, and arm actuators, and he got it to walk in 1 shot. Obviously this is more impressive, but it's also not insane for the field.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It’s task specific. This is a visual model trained on a very specific dataset. Game models could generate their own datasets. It just depends on the task. There is also the fact that human brains have different parts of differing sizes and importance so certain tasks might be really easy to surpass humans on because we suck at them, but for other tasks our brains are built for solving them so it would be much harder to get a model to outperform us.</div>

Computers win out because they can calculate very deeply and they don't have emotional state affecting their play. Humans using things like Stockfish, AlphaZero, Leela etc. mostly memorize lines or use them to evaluate their play.

Chess has perfect information. Everything you need to know is on the board. Medicine is a different frontier though.  Not all information is available to you, the information is in a variety of different locations. Some amount of information is inaccurate (intentionally or unintentionally).</div>

Very simple technique that cuts through the crap and hopefully it will get your neurotransmitters flowing! Wishing you much metta

                        <div class="comment-body">Sitting down with the spine erect helps. Lying down or reclining is a recipe for low energy/dullnes. Meditate with the eyes open occasionally. 

Do your best to open up the awareness to the body, if stretching it over the whole body feels difficult, just find any sensation and stay with it, and awareness will gradually stretch on its own.

If you're having trouble concentrating, you might want to mentally label whatever body part you're feeling at a pace of \~2 seconds each label more or less. This labeling process will aid the concentration greatly. Of course feel free to drop them once they begin feeling cumbersome, and take them up again as needed.

Good luck</div>

Jokes aside, it feels like you might benefit from a more structured workflow. Here’s a suggestion:

1.  First, decide what needs to be built. Discuss your ideas with an AI to explore how it could be built. Once you're satisfied, move to step 2.
2.  Next, create a formal Product Requirements Document (PRD). Ensure this document covers everything, including edge cases.
3.  Then, convert the PRD into a task and sub-task list. You can use a tool like this: [https://www.task-master.dev](https://www.task-master.dev) (it's free).
4.  For every feature, create a new branch. Ask the AI to work on one sub-task at a time and verify that it works by writing tests. Then, move on to the next sub-task. Repeat this process until the entire task is completed. Test everything again, create a pull request (PR), and merge it.

P.S. For work projects, I use Test-Driven Development (TDD), and everything works like a charm. I’ve created entire modules (thousands of lines of code) that are now in production and used by thousands of people.</div>

Instead, think of it like you’ve just been promoted from junior dev to project manager and now you have a team of junior devs working for you. You can just tell them “fix my oauth” and move along. You have to architect the solution and assign the tasks out.</div>

Edit: as some have mentioned, if you find the iron with water already in it, make sure to drain it in the sink and then fill with fresh water before turning on. Also, make sure to hit the steam button numerous times as you’re going over the towel.  </div>

The old guard are using the rule book to get Hogg tossed because he plans to use a crazy amount of the war chest to primary out old Democrats and get in more AOCs. So they got the lawyers involved to invalidate the Hogg and Kenyatta election wins. There's a shakeup in the works. This isn't a culture war thing.</div>
