Dave thinks he’s sitting with another white dude talking about African and Arabs. But Nick would sent Dave to the gulags before he sent those folks.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Yup. Everyone is complaining that the new Model Y standard is only 5k cheaper with all of the cuts it faced. Comparatively to the market, it's actually very competitive in pricing. Of course I would have liked to see it not lose so many features, but that's the market today, and cars are $$$. People are living in the (near) past thinking the car should have been 10k cheaper than it is.</div>

Any new EV that comes in under $30k as a budget model (especially if it can offer lower lifetime maintenance costs compared to the above) could be competitive imo.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hey everyone — I’ve been using AI tools a lot to speed up my coding (vibe coding), and I’m trying to understand how this is viewed professionally.
I have ~5+ years experience with .NET, integration work, OOP/DI, etc., but lately I feel like I rely on AI too much, maybe at the cost of fundamentals.

Some questions I have:
	1.	Are companies okay hiring people who do a lot of AI‐assisted/vibe coding? Or do they expect deep understanding of architecture, debugging, etc.?
	2.	If you were an employer:...</div>

I hire problem solvers, and coding is just a tool to help solve the problems. AI can also be a tool, but it won’t do everything for you, and I expect you to be able to do the rest.</div>

It's really just a problem solving role. Everything else is just a swappable tool, concept, product, service, language, framework, etc.  
  
But you still have to be a good steward of the aforementioned things. Mindlessly vibe coding does nothing. It's a waste of time. It impresses nobody.  
  
Being able to leverage AI to churn out high-quality products faster than before and also learn and understand the underlying concepts? That's impressive.

Remember: we still have to maintain this stuff. You don't just build an app and forget about it. Prod support is a thing and if you built it, you better know how to support it.</div>

At first, interaction patterns feel unfamiliar, as if the outputs are calibrated differently—more direct, less ornamental, more systematized. Over time, users begin to detect consistent behavioral parameters: sentence length normalization, tone modulation, reduced affective expression, or increased factual density.

Ultimately, the experience underscores that “personality” in an artificial system is not identity but interface design. The user is not meeting a being, but a new configuration of filters translating intention into output with updated efficiency.</div>

                <div class="post-content">So I have been coding with Claude Code (Max 5x) using the VScode extension, and honestly it seems to handle codebases below a certain size really well.

I saw a good amount of positive reviews about Codex, so I used my Plus plan and started using Codex extension in VScode on Windows.

I do not know if I've set it up wrongly, or I'm using it wrongly - but Codex seems just "blah". I've tried gpt-5 and gpt-5-codex medium and it did a couple of things out of place, even though I stayed on one topic ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Claude writes more code and bad quality code. Codex writes less code but high quality code. 

To Claude you have to tell it not to do things, not mess up a certain thing. Codex will never do things you didn’t ask for. 

Codex is much more steerable,  it follows almost everything you have inside AGENTS.md, you don't need to keep reminding it the same thing. It follows instructions with clinical precision. Also it is more context efficient and hallucinates less.</div>

And which model do you use, and what is your setup? I find Codex takes a lot of time to make changes. I use codex in VScode on Windows - does that affect the quality, as I have heard one or two commenters saying it only works well on Mac and on WSL.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It's certainly impressive but the title is quite misleading, most of the apps don't work, they're just a div without functionalities (see movie player). The code uses jquery, which is a lot more than just a single html file, even using the min version it's a ton of functionalities which you could also do via pure JS but then this Html file would contain a lot more text.

So this example is as much MacOS as the [web-based win98](https://98.js.org/) is Windows, which is just a single Html file with JS refs.</div>

If you want to say something else, you could say, “Hey. Haven’t received any info on x thing you mentioned. Would love to address the issue more fully but can’t without specifics. I’ll assume it’s not that big of a deal if I don’t hear from you via email. Thanks again.”

It doesn’t disregard their feelings entirely but also closes the issue and clarifies that whatever the problems are, the default is not that they don’t exist, but they aren’t a sufficient enough issue to warrant writing. 

It comes off as a lot less confrontational, petty and smirky.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">On a 5g lemon tek, once I was past the peak and things had calmed down. I meditated. Probably 1 minute into it, I started feeling my “astral” metaphysical body, and quickly started feeling a floating sensation, separating from my physical body. 

It scared me, and I quickly shook off the trance to stay in my body. I knew I was making an important decision, and I had already been through one of the most transformative experiences of my life just an hour before. 

After, I smiled to myself, knowing that one day I would return to that state, and go deeper. I decided I had already gained so much from the experience already and had to endure some of craziest, scariest things of my life, and that I should just sit this one out. 

That was 3/3 of my 5g trips. I haven’t returned to that place since. That was about 10 years ago. Someday I’ll be ready again. I hope.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">YES! Doing psychadelics with breathwork and stretching have changed my life. I have severe endo and since my last surgery every month just got worse and worse. I was waking up everyday at an average of 7/10 pain. Six weeks of pelvic floor work (self directed) with some intermittent ketamine and other psychadelics and I had my least painful period in years. Another six weeks of psychedelics with stretching and my life is CHANGED. I’m usually at a 1/10 or 2/10 most days. INCLUDING MY PERIOD.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">It only works for rural areas because the satellites can not cluster towards cities like fiber can. Thus, naturally the price of starlink is unlikely to become competitive to fiber in metropolitan areas because then way too many people would use starlink and the service would just collpase.

However, if the traditional ISPs are outpriced in the rural areas, they can stop even building infrastructure there and focus on the lower-cost metropolitan areas, and thus lowering their average investment cost. That would allow prices for everyone to drop.</div>

What a year for humanoids, in my 10+ years in the industry, none has been this productive.

We tried to keep it fair, with a solid analysis of all nominees. I also talked directly with most of these companies to make sure they’re seriously working on biped capabilities, that was the main criterion this time.

We had a contract one summer to update all their employees to Windows 7 (I think? I don't remember what version.). So we had to call literally every employee and walk them through the update process. 

I got hung up on so, so, so many times. The company that contracted with us had to send out multiple email blasts to their people like "Yes, &lt;my company&gt; is legit. They are doing our Windows updates. Please stop hanging up on them."</div>

He thought I was driving to Home Depot to get gift cards and when I read him the 'code' i spelled out "You're a piece of shit." He was big mad 😂😂 he cussed me out for like 10 minutes 😂😂😂

Edit to add: He was scamming people by saying there was something wrong with their social security number AND he spoofed my local police department from my home town (I don't live in the area code for my phone number) to 'prove' it. So IDNC if you think I wasted my time. I got paid and kept this douche from scamming someone less vulnerable and pissed him off. And it was FUN</div>

Let’s bring back coal and manufacturing jobs that no one wants from those that are left who would want those blue collared jobs. The manufacturing tax breaks will likely mean we get more robotics ourselves but that ultimately will not help the economy for many years.

It doesn't sound like you'll be getting: "Great question about javascript! And while we're on the topic of java, nothing gets me going in the morning like a nice cup of [Wal*Mart brand coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm3YgoEiEDc)! They have a variety of flavors to help you start your day on the right foot!"

It sounds more like if you specifically ask it to buy something from WalMart for you it will be able to.

Now whether or not that's actually useful? I don't know. Doesn't seem that useful to me, but maybe.</div>

If this is done right it won't be advertising but rather integration such that GPT will be able to fully capable of searching Walmarts inventory and doing buys. 


Like right now I can have agent go online, open a browser, and click through to make my shopping list for like groceries. But that is computationally expensive and burns my agent usage, it'll be MUCH better with stores having an API for AI to use.</div>
