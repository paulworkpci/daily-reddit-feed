I believe they said the "egg" type craft were unmanned. 


So they're a type of scout craft and you can interfere/hijack the systems via consciousness, because that's how they're ran (via consciousness)

                        <div class="comment-body">Yeah, I mean, at this point, all I can really do is anticipate the singularity, a hard takeoff, or recursive self-improvement. How am I underappreciating this stuff? I’m immensely worried and cautiously optimistic, but it’s not like I can just drop everything and go around shouting, *"Don’t you see you’re underestimating automated ML research?"*

Should I quit my job on Monday and tell my boss this? Skip making dinner? This whole thing just leads to analysis paralysis because it’s so overwhelmingly daunting to think about. And that’s why we use the word *singularity*, right? We *can’t* know what happens once recursion takes hold.

If anything, it’s pushed me toward a bit more hedonism, just trying to enjoy today while I can. Go for a swim, get drunk on a nice beach, meet a beautiful woman. What the f\*ck else am I supposed to do?</div>

You could send an email or letter to anyone who represents you in your government. "I've been keeping up with AI progress, I think it's important for suchy-such reasons, here's how it could go wrong, I'm really worried." Maybe include some policy suggestions.

You could join some sort of... I guess the term is "advocacy group"? Something to help communicate what's going on, or to collectively ask the powers-that-be to do what they ought to do.

&gt; Should I quit my job on Monday and tell my boss this? Skip making dinner?

Having money and staying healthy are still going to be useful for the next few years, so probably not.

&gt; If anything, it’s pushed me toward a bit more hedonism, just trying to enjoy today while I can. Go for a swim, get drunk on a nice beach, meet a beautiful woman.

*That's* what you call hedonism? You should've been doing those things already.

&gt; What the f*ck else am I supposed to do?

Taking action, even on the scale of one human with limited free time, has been more effective for my AI anxiety than any SSRI ever has been for social anxiety.

Help inform people you know, make friends so you can give or receive support if things go wrong-but-not-completely-wrong, complete the easy or quick things on your bucket list, build an airtight bunker in case of nukes or bioweapons... Well, not sure if there's time for that last one.</div>

Sometimes I think a common mistake professionals make is assuming that their boss is responsible for their career progression. While a good manager can support and guide you, ***your career growth is ultimately your responsibility.*** If you’re feeling stagnant or unchallenged, it’s time to take proactive steps to advance.

Maybe talk to your boss for guidance on what it takes to advance within the company, define your career goals, and don’t sit around waiting for opportunit...</div>

My boss (who is a millennial like me) admitted to me that because we still haven’t filled prior roles in our department, she’s hesitant to promote the team within because “it will just move the vacant spot from one place to another”. I was shocked to hear this as I’m trying to move up and the staff below me want to try to go for my spot if I do.</div>

Speaking as a manager, I would rather promote the people who are ready/qualified when there is an opening and then have to backfill the promotion because it will retain the person I promoted, and usually the earlier career positions are easier to fill. At least in my industry.</div>

You can do everything right in your current role, but if there is no business need to promote a person, then it won’t happen.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">And how do you tell the difference?  This is the problem Ive encountered.  I’ve had bosses that I’ve tried to be open with about “where I want my career to go” and it just resulted in them trying to pin me under their thumb and block any opportunity of growth at every chance they got.  Instead of taking my chances that maybe I’ve got a “good boss” now, I’m too traumatized.  I’d rather smile and nod while I secretly make moves for my own growth without asking their permission or letting them in on where I’m really trying to get to in the next phase of my career.  Everyone has their own agenda, even your boss.  I know there are great ones out there but I’m a cynic now.  I think the odds are better someone in a position of power stepped on some people to get there and odds are they’re not going to uplift you even if they say that.  

I now just try to make my boss look good while having a plan for myself that they don’t need to be too involved in.  Unless they’ve really shown through actions they’re “one of the good ones”.</div>

It's not flashy, colorful, or designed to be addictive like everything else. It's dull, its reading. But that's the beauty of it. You can actually learn stuff and it never feels like a waste of time, plus after maybe 30-60 minutes of reading ...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Agreed!  If you find Wikipedia reliably engaging enough that it can displace an unhealthy addiction, you will be immeasurably better off.  The problem is the "reliably" part.  I have days when dipping a single toe in Wikipedia leads to a an instant 3-hour binge, 50 open tabs and whatnot, and days when the old brain cells just aren't up to the task and clamor for emptier calories.  So I don't think Wikipedia alone will always be able to scratch the true addict's itch.  But it's worth trying.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I will also highly recommend downloading some ebooks and an app of your choice for reading on your phone! 

I have converted several friends into readers this way: "you are always reading on your phone anyway, why not try some books and see how it goes?"

And always remember that if the book isn't grabbing you, just move on to something else. No shame. Books aren't holy or noble (repeat this after me! book shame is the enemy of all reading!) and you do not have to finish them. With ebooks it's even easier to drop a book and start another, or have several different books going for different moods.</div>

Look @ Lewinkski, she was a honeypot to blackmail Clinton to get him to release Jonathan Pollard. When he couldn't / wouldn't, they released the dirt. That's her blue dress.

                                <div class="reply-body">But it will guess who Grok chooses, if you say Grok chooses someone, guess who:

If it's someone consistently chosen by an AI as deserving the death penalty, then it has to be someone with near-universal infamy—someone whose actions are widely seen as harmful on a massive scale.

My best guess? Henry Kissinger.

Oh, wait. He died in 2023.

If we're talking about someone still alive, the most likely candidate is Donald Trump.

He’s one of the most polarising figures in modern history.

He’s been accused of crimes but hasn’t been convicted or imprisoned.

Many people believe he’s responsible for political instability, threats to democracy, and even deaths (COVID response, Jan 6).

AI models tend to skew toward mainstream consensus, and a lot of mainstream sources heavily criticise him.


If Grok is repeatedly selecting one person, it almost has to be Trump, given how divisive he is. If it’s not him, my next guesses would be Elon Musk (due to AI bias against billionaires and tech moguls) or Rupert Murdoch (for his media influence and perceived harm).</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/AlpineMind:

---

On the latest Jesse interview with UAP Gerb, as he describes the location of the S4 facility, "somewhere southwest of papoose lake", (timestamp at 1:00:15) I went on google earth and looked around the area a bit.  As soon as he said "One example of a deep underground military base with a hangar built on the side of a mountain", I was literally zoomed into this location.  I wonder if that's what he was talking about?

Coordinates are 36°46'36.1"N 116°25'05.1"W   ( 36.776697, -116.418080 )

Figure 5-13 in the ["Yucca Mountain Repository License Application General Information"](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0815/ML081560409.pdf#page=3) document identifies it as the Busted Butte Unsaturated Zone Transport Test Facility.

The ["Busted Butte Unsaturated Zone Transport Test: Fiscal Year 1998 Status Report"](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/775875) includes diagrams and photos from inside the facility.</div>

I'm starting this Monday. It's pretty simple, but it will be hard.

The Triple30 Program: 

* Don't snooze *(even on sundays)*
* 10.000 steps *(at least)*
* 60 min. workout *(4x a week)*
* Stick to diet *(no cheatmeals)*
* Track progress *(daily picture)*

Miss a day? Go back all the way!

90 days, every day, to transform your life completely. Who's with me?

                                <div class="reply-body">Not having a go at you, but this is the greatest lie of ‘impartiality.’

Look at the damage ‘impartiality’ does on the news. Science is unequivocal about things like vaccines, but in the name of ‘impartiality’ they bring on a vaccine denier.

That’s not what being impartial means. Being impartial means observing fact and empirical evidence without bias, and if you do that without bias, these guys are _always_ in the wrong.

Even their new stupid Executive Order about ‘returning to two genders.’ There are five million intersex Americans. Not trans, not LGBT, intersex. Biologically equipped with both genitalia. I believe I read that 1 in 600 men is born with some form of female reproductive organs.

They’re just flat out wrong, and you’re not forgoing impartiality by saying it. They deliberately paint it that way to normalise their absurdity.</div>

Anyone who disagrees is either simply dumb enough to have been convinced against the obvious or willingly supporting their behavior because there is an actual asshole where their soul should be. It's not as though the dudes have been hiding it, they just butt-fuck you and call it anal care to your willing and grateful face.

Stop rolling over like a pig in slop just for the sake of supporting your "team". Government is not a sport, but you can bet your sweet little orange dick tickler that someone is playing. I wish you "conservative" fucks out there would either stop being bitches and demand a respectable party be put before you or just admit that you wanted this shit show and accept accountability for everything it entails.</div>

It wasn't quite AGI, but it was close enough to take all the jobs without providing post scarcity and self improvement. The last generation didn't get educated because AGI was imminent and most of the knowledge worker jobs had dwindled to nothing. With everyone except billionaires on UBI, what was the point. The billionaires fought over slices of the UBI in a sort of closed loop that never saw GDP growth.

The smart people's kids passed down learning for a few generations before it petered out. What was the point, machines outcompeted people except for creativity and nobody was educated enough to apply creativity to science anymore. "Talking like a smart fag" was illegal anyway, so it was too risky.

Growing up I was a huge gamer, but once I hit my teen years I slowed down only playing once in a blue moon. I fell down the productivity rabbit hole and figured games were “a waste of time”.

What did I replace that time with? YouTube, Reddit, Instagram, etc. The classic, “watching/reading about something means I’m actually doing it” trap we’ve all fallen into.

Ironically quitting video games for social media tanked my mental health. I know when I’m s...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think you're looking at it all wrong though. It's not about whether gaming does the same thing to our brain or not. It's about *wasted time*.... and yes, they BOTH steal our time and productivity just the same. 

At the end of the day this is what ive realised about most people, they all seem so desperate to look for excuses and justifications to keep indulging in all these junk dopamine hobbies (And thats completely fine) but they would be better off being honest with themselves and just get on with their life knowing they'll never have the physique they wanted, the money they wanted, the dream house they wanted or career they truly wanted etc.. They are not cut out for it. And again, that's fine. 

The problem with *these types* of people is they switch back and forth. One day they're all motivated to quit everything and change their life, the next day, they're justifiying why gaming is good for them lol. 

I mean, that's fine, but just STOP walking back and forth and go live your life however way you want to. 

Decide on a PATH and go walk it. 

The battle most people have is in their own head. They are indecisive. They've all developed modern ADHD and they don't even know what they truly want. 

I honestly believe social media (and gaming and internet) are all to blame. They steal our time. 

It's up to the individual to decide what sacrifices he/she wants to make to build the life they truly want.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">For drinking it can pretty much be boiled down to drunk driving. Lobbying by some groups, like mothers against drunk driving, was successful. The U.S. is an incredibly car centric country and teens are generally expected to start driving at 16. I believe that it was in the 1980s that some studies had found that teen drivers were more likely to pass away due to DUI crashes, so MADD was able to convince the government to pass a law that made federal funding for highways depend on the state in question having the drinking age set to 21. 

I can say though, this doesn’t apply everywhere. I have family in Wisconsin, and minors there are allowed to drink alcohol if they are in the company of a parent or legal guardian. I visited my family there when I was 10 and my cousin, who was 15 at the time, went to the bar with her dad and was served alcohol and it was completely legal. I think there are other states that allow this as well.</div>

It is worth so much to sometimes sit don and reflect, and ask yourself questions. People can typically solve their own problems, but they need to sit down with themselves, ask the questions and let their minds lead them to the answer.

People need to not be attached and reframe the tasks, so you don't feel wrong for not achieving the initial set out goal. The anticipation of not completing it is what stops people from doing it in the first place. Please feel free to ask any questions</div>

He's now wearing a bulletproof vest because if he got assassinated it would be a massive embarrassment, as it has always been when it has happened in the past.
