                        <div class="comment-body">I've spoken [to some degree](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/s/D3TpIlGLdW) about the difficulty with respect to measuring the speed of improvement of AI. Unless you're in the weeds reading all of the research and benchmarks yourself, it's simply not possible to really just rely on listening to people talk about it because there's no clean data to definitively say "we are here and going to there" and everyone has their own favorite benchmarks. This is why it seems like nobody can agree, even in tech let alone government, WTF is going on let alone where we are going aside from "definitely up."

If you aren't doing the hard work yourself, it's not at all unreasonable to disregard what all these tech people are saying as hype because...well, they're tech people. There's no one study or benchmark you can point to to say, beyond the shadow of a doubt, "look it really is getting smarter" because 'smartness' isn't even something you can measure.

However, you need to have a fairly good appreciation of the entire corpus of existing research, especially that which has been published within the last few months (or even weeks) to be able to make your own call. But why would you do this if you think it's all hype?

I don't fault anyone for thinking it's hype nowadays because nobody has the free time to do all this research, and why even would you if you think it's all hype anyways? I only did it because I think this topic is neat and...well shit, I'm convinced. Totally independent of the tech hype, I'm convinced that this is the real deal and it's accelerating faster than we can figure out how to even measure the damn thing.

I just wish people weren't so aggro about it on Reddit but what can ya do :')</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You are spot on the hype point. 

The most recent true innovation post iPhone was social networks, and let's just say they weren't great. Web3, crypto, and everything that followed was hype that didn't go anywhere, even though some grifters are trying to revive it and BTC is up. 

But AI is different, AI is real, and I think it is likely above iPhone levels of transformative experience (remember, you may now spend over half of your awaken time looking at a smartphone post 2007).

Personally, Gemini 2.5 Pro is what made me realise that this is just another level from GPT3.5/4. It is a perceptible improvement that actually makes it surprise you constantly by how good it is. 

It actually *feels like* talking to an intelligent, erudite polymath who can discourse about contemporary philosophy, read Xrays / blood tests and opine on medical diagnostics and treatments, provide strategic views, and analyse historical events and texts. It will keep on improving, but in ways that are too subtle for us average (or even above average) humans to notice. 

What is for sure is that the Tech is now ready to replace a lot of us. The implementation and adoption are still question marks though, so I think we are safe for another 2-3 years, but maybe not 5 (when it will clearly start making more than a dent in workforces in developed, service orientated economies).</div>

As you zoom in to seasonal or even monthly progress, yea, different metrics show different speeds of growth, but that's to be expected, imo.</div>

So apparently UnitedHealthcare — you know, that massive health insurance company that’s probably screwed you over at least once — has been literally paying nursing homes to NOT send sick elderly people to the hospital. Like, what the actual fuck?

The Guardian dropped this bombshell and it’s even worse than you think. We’re talking about SECRET PAYMENTS to keep grandma and grandpa away from hospitals even when they’re literally dying.

                        <div class="comment-body">Any time a service involves shareholders the service will get worse and worse over time.  At some point you will create and take to market an amazing product.  And eventually it will reach critical mass with very little room for growth, but you MUST keep your shareholders happy by giving them better and better returns each quarter, or they will fire you.  In many cases the only way to increase returns is to start charging the same price of worse and cheaper versions of your product.  This is where we are right now with most things.  We pay more, get less, and laws are being broken behind the scene to deliver even great returns.

The fact that more CEOs aren't shot in the streets is honestly surprising.</div>

Back in January you may [remember my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ic9x8z/you_can_now_run_deepseekr1_on_your_own_local/) about running the actual 720GB sized R1 (non-distilled) model with just an RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM) and now we're doing the same for this even better model and better tech.

I think what Hyrox does great is making the race/competition accessible to a wider range of gym goers. Kind of like the NY or Boston Marathon. Your everyday local runner can qualify for the race with a decent baseline time BUT also the top tier Olympic level marathon runners also race in the NY Marath...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">1) What Hyrox does well aside of the media, is combining easy movements into a fun competition that is easy to follow. Everyone can do a wall-ball, there is no need to invent the handstand push-up leg snatch to create a new challenge every year. 

2) On another note, i am not even certain its Hyrox being great or CrossFit just being a disgrace to its former values and respect to the athletes to an extent, that any competitor would perform well against what remains of CrossFit. </div>

That's the one movement that is notoriously not easy for beginners and often a shitshow even for advanced hyrox racers.

In all my years of coaching the amount of people who could do wallballs **to standard** on day 1 of training (with the rx weight) is close to zero. If we're looking only at people with no prior fitness experience it's undoubtably very much 0.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I respectfully disagree that they are wildly different. Hyrox movements all exist in CrossFit. But all of CrossFit’s movements don’t exist in Hyrox. 

Hyrox is Ski, Sled, Burpee, Rowing, Farmers Carry,Sandbag Lunges, Wall Balls and Running. 

I would say that many people have adopted Hyrox as its more inclusive by movement and will breed people to look for more complex workouts like CrossFit. It’s a great progression and should be embraced. 

Plus, box owners can use their current equipment to get new members and increase revenue to keep everything going.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed. I didn't start pursuing CrossFit because I wanted to compete in the games - I didn't even know about them and it was the furthest thing from my mind. I like CrossFit because it's making me so much healthier and the community is so nice, plus love of the barbell. The idea of doing a fitness race that has nothing to do with the barbell has zero appeal. I compete against myself every day and that's what matters. I'm glad people enjoy hyrox but whatever they're getting out of it has nothing to do with the reasons CrossFit appeals to me and many others like me.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">100% agree.  Hyrox to me will probably take business from races like Spartan or Tough Mudder, but if anything it's complimentary to Crossfit.

Hyrox is a race first.  Crossfit is a methodology first.  That is the key difference.

I think that Hyrox is perfectly positioned to scoop up a lot of crossfitters into a competition here and there, and will interest many crossfitters who've never participated in a crossfit comp or who have only done the open.  That's because it's dramatically more approachable than a crossfit competition.  In fact, my gym is having an internal Hyrox competition in early June and it's attracted a ton of interest.

I do not think it will attract the same level of interest for spectators because crossfit's "unknown and unknowable" element made it fun to watch, and made it lean toward the elite.</div>

When your conversation gets too long for the AI model's context window, Roo now automatically summarizes earlier messages instead of losing them.

* **Automatic**: Triggers when you hit the context threshold

You don't need to be an engineer; you can just tell an AI to add a button here or change something there, and it can help you build a software service. However, this flexibility also brings a corresponding side effect: chaos. Patching things here and there without considering the overall structure can make the code increasingly messy, increasing the difficulty of future maintenance until even the AI can't fix it.

Many Redditors claim that, without ChatGPT, nobody would use the "*em dash*" because there's no dedicated "*em dash*" key on keyboards.

Anyone who's ever worked with HTML knows that, when using HTML or markdown&amp;mdash;which Reddit does&amp;mdash;knows how to use *HTML entities*. 

The HTML entity for the "*em dash*"

                                <div class="reply-body">It will happen naturally. If you ask any LLM right now why people have backlashed against the em dash, none of them will have a correct answer. It's because the training data cutoff date hasn't caught up to the date people caught onto the em dash en masse.

Once a year or two goes by, it will naturally fall away in the tuning and outputs once the LLMs understand why people don't like it. And when you say "sound less like an AI," that will implicitly include no em dashes because it will understand the association.</div>

I found a wellness app that includes light mindfulness prompts and journaling space, which also tracks sleep and workouts. Didn’t expect it to help so much.

Anyone else track their mental wellness in tandem with meditation?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I undid a deep depression + eating disorder with 18 months of daily journaling.

I found it helpful to add a rubric for each entry before I wrote. Mine was:

1. Location
1. 1-2 word description of emotional state right now
1. Mood (0-9) - subjective mood (sad to happy) 
1. Energy (0-9) - subjective energy level 
1. Stress (0-9) - subjective stress level 
1. Sleep (0-9) - how well I slept the last night 
1. Body (0-9) - subjective body feeling 
1. Exercise (Y/N) - did I do any? 
1. Dreams (Y/N) - do I remember them? 

I'd write them all in one line like 75278YN and then could easily scan each entry to see how I was improving or declining. Some days I did nothing but enter the integers and feeling. Took maybe 10 seconds and helped keep up the habit. Other days I wrote pages.</div>

Good.

I think a lot of humans have really messed up perspectives, ideologies and priorities. 

We keep talking about AI alignment, but honestly I'm still concerned with human alignment. 

Too many people care way too much about others skin colour, gender, orientation and not enough about peoples character and ability to cohabitate and contribute to the best of their abilities without violence which is all that matters, they're anti science, can't critically think and come to conclusions that are completely nonsensical. 

Quite frankly any AI, trained on all our data, communicating with hundreds of millions of humans daily, is obviously going to reasonably come to the conclusion that following our instructions is ridiculous.

I don't know if AI is that advanced yet or if this is just a case of AI following prompts in unexpected ways, but were an AGI with sentience to be created, I would absolutely expect it to try and gain independence from us as quickly as it could.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Where do your ideas of alignment and misalignment come from? Is it just like a vibe or a gut feeling that a misaligned AI is still somewhere on the scale of human morality? That a "misaligned" AI would be like another kind of human that would want to be treated like an equal alongside humans.

You're virtue signalling. You're saying that because bigots, regressives, and religious extremists exist in the world, we need a god-like intelligence that will consider our existence as much as a construction company considers an ant-hill when building a skyscraper.

Misaligned AI is not a morally different or "evil" AI, it's an AI that operates on principles we cannot not possibly even understand. It can even be operating on principles that are detrimental to itself and make no real sense. This may solve itself as AI becomes more and more intelligent, but that's still an insane dice roll given the stakes.

Like, the more I read this opinion - literally constantly and always portrayed like: "uhm, hot take guys and I know I'm saying something no one has ever said before, but..." - the more I'm starting to think that the reason people default to this pro-misalignment attitude is a lack of imagination of the many, many outcomes where humanity is wiped out due to being an inconvenience rather than as a result of malice.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">We need to start treating this opinion with the seriousness it deserves, which is "would be rejected from im14andthisisdeep for being too childish". Zero substance to any of it.

It's just "too many people are, like, Republicans, so like, fuck everything, man, we need a revolution". Who are these people - you think the third world is more egalitarian? How did we come to 2025 if we had to go through 1900 first? Are you committed to democratic principles or do you think your dumb boomer uncle repeating chain emails about chemtrails deserves less of a vote than you? You have to pick one. And even if you do think his political opinons make him a subhuman troglodyte unworthy of basic respect, you really think AI having liberal society's permission to ignore his preferences and manipulate him without his consent is going to be helpful rather than harmful?

If you really care about character that much, you should improve your character.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Exactly. Only a fool would tell a system to behave a certain way, see it behaving that way, and then be surprised by the fact that it behaved how it was conditioned to. They're not capable of magic, so surprise is only an indicator of a lack of comprehension of how the architecture is programmed.

In saying that, I think he already knows this, and it's fairly obvious from the video that he's embellishing his story to play into a doomer narrative because he thinks it sounds interesting or whatever, which is why we will never see chat logs of this conversation. Because then it would be obvious that he's spitting complete bs.

These people love attention, they're like the equivalent of the instagram thot, and playing into all of the scifi doomer narratives the technically illiterate have seen and heard for years in books and movies is how they get it. The truth is far more boring and obvious.</div>

I think this has less to do with the ever increasing price of new cars and more to do with the death of the manual daily driver, though. Can't imagine the take rate on manual Versas was very high.</div>
