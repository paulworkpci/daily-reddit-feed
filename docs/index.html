                                <div class="reply-body">“Speeding and intoxication weren't the driver's only alleged crimes, either. Castle Hills Police claim the modified Model T was not roadworthy, as it lacked brake lights and turn signals. Additionally, the hot-rod nature of the century-old beast meant it was reportedly ‘modified beyond factory specifications.’”  
   
Is hot rodding a car somehow not legal in Australia? Or is it legal until someone decides to use their souped up car to do something legal? No brake lights or turn signals is definitely a problem, but “Modified beyond factory specifications” makes the rest of it sound inherently nefarious. I thought there was a relatively well established hot rod/car modding culture in Australia, or at least that’s what a documentary by the name of Mad Max led me to believe.</div>

I started last year and after a whole year of doing crossfit and consistently showing up every other day, with someone with ADHD and Anxiety, it does help\* me stay together too. I'm almost addicted to it, although I wish I could get better at my endurance and cardio already..

I even posted a video about my journey [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDKt2U6eEqs) (I'm not a YouTuber or anything) , I started sharing about my fitness journey recently just to inspire others)</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Or maybe the improvements were very noticeable until now? 

Model went from 10% to like 50% with the release from Chatgpt.
Then kept improving until Gpt4o, reaching maybe 70% with scaled compute, RHLF, some synthetic data. Add reasoning to that and you get to maybe 90%. I am not referring to any benchmark, but rather how convincing they are. 

I would say that going from 90% to 95% for LLMs is going to be barely noticeable. I personally feel like the past 6 months have been reaching near perfection on certain aspects, and very good to good in the rest. Models tend to be fairly good and convincing in some domains I have some modicum of domain expertise in (maybe masters level knowledge, not PhD). I feel like any improvement from there is going to be from Graduate to postgraduate / PhD level - you have to be one to really see the improvement, and it's going to be marginal and therefore barely noticeable for most. 

Maybe next stage is hallucination elimination for LLMs and the roll out of agents this enables - ie semi autonomous, long chains of self prompting/correcting models (with deep research being proto agents of sorts). But here the deployment of such agents may be hindered by human skepticism, compute availability and other factors which are not binary. Most technologies (computers, web 1.0, wireless / mobile, social media / cloud) typically crash a quarter or a third into their arc from nascency to maturity (which typically takes 10-20 years), it could be the case that we are reaching this time for AI.</div>

AI and block chain are awesome techs, but these high end grifters are, and have been from the start, selling a dream that we are no where near. AGI will be here in 6 months says Elmo... just like your fully autonomus car that will be done in 2012, or your home robot that will be mass produced by 2020.

The engineers and coders are awesome. These guys are snake oil salesmen that are overselling hype to enrich themselves personally. So, yes, they will lie to you about how close we are to (insert any flashy tech idea) every single day and straight in your face. 


If you question their illogical statements or bring up the many missed targets and broken promises, you dont hear sound reasoning or reasonable admition. Instead you get, "you just can't comprehend." : The last bastion of coward grifters and fake intellectuals, you aren't smart enough so just give us the money because Im worth 250m a year, because, again, Im super smart and you dont get it.

This kind of makes it easy to deny by definition though. The difference between 2023 and 2024 models was huge and obvious. The difference between 6 months ago (turn of the year 2024 -&gt; 2025) to now, if it's not obvious.. By definition means the place didn't hugely increase</div>

As far as I can tell, the newer models are on average better than the older models (the site also makes that claim, that newer models perform better than older models with the same level of compute). But that's just an obvious claim to make. I don't see how you can actually quantify that progress over specific time frames.</div>

Also TIL there are yeasts that are modified to produce hemoglobin, it's just absurdly expensive.</div>

Has anyone here built a full project using AI help with JavaScript? What did you use, and was the experience smooth or just more fixing than coding?

I'd argue it's the 2nd best language grasp it has behind Python. There's just so much training knowledge it had to work with for JS/TS. 

It fights you more on things like Flutter I've found.</div>

These jobs are highly specialised and require lots of dexterity and human connection. I agree most other office based jobs are 100% gone and eventually AI will be programmed to cover all aspects of electrical engineering and other manual labour jobs. I think doctors and nurses will be the most protected jobs.</div>

The Netflix documentary showed he has no shame for not only doing steroids but also acting like a psycho, homeschooling his kids in his weird cult and giving them permanent damage socially, running through the forest with a giant knife, shooting a cow and eating it raw on the spot, the list is long. The most disturbing part is his wife and inner circle encourage and amplify his idiot behavior.

That said, he recently sounds *much* different in his videos and seems to be having a mental health breakdown. He sounds more like a schizophrenic family member of mine than I’m comfortable with.

For the user experience, it's better than OpenAI's Codex cli but lacks Claude Code's more polished quality of life experience (for instance the ability to send a message while the model is working, or to auto-complete a file path with tab). 

As for the actual task, it's good because it uses Gemini Pro 2.5, but  it doesn't follow the instructions in Gemini.md so I had to re-tell it everything. Also Claude Code often goes beyond what I'm asking and does more things, which might be good or bad depending on who you ask. Gemini cli tends to do only what I'm asking, and sometimes a bit less. 

Another surprise is that in my past experience, Gemini Pro 2.5 wasn't very good in using tools. Using Codex CLI, which allows you to use any model (and that's really commendable from OpenAI), the OAI models and Claude used the tools without problem, but Gemini Pro and Deepseek failed miserably most of the time. Here, it is quite capable (but I strongly hinted at what it should do in my prompt).

Compared to Claude Code, it has a larger context so you can feed it more files without fear (up to a certain limit), and it's free for now, which is a big plus. Claude Code is however better and faster, particularly because of its ability to break some tasks and delegate them to sub-agents in parallel, but that's also why it's so expensive and why it burns tokens faster.

So for now I'll still keep Claude Code as my main drive, but when I exceed the limits, instead of using Aider I'm now going to use Gemini cli.</div>

The agentic coding feels underwhelming, it struggles to locate and analyze the right files before diving into coding. Claude Code handles this much better.

                                <div class="reply-body">I wrote an [MCP server](https://github.com/pdavis68/RepoMapper) that's based on Aider's "Repo Map" functionality. It gives the agent a better understanding of the code and it's relationships. It's not a static map. The LLM passes in filenames from the conversation and the repomap follows the graph of relationships between the files and then assigns a relevancy score to the files. You can specify how much of the context to assign to it and a few other options. 

Only wrote it over the weekend and haven't used it with Google CLI yet, so I honestly have no idea how helpful it would be, but it might improve things.</div>

Gemini failed miserably to follow instructions properly and the end result wasn't even close. It didn't know the limitations of the console it was using either, which resulted in me having to force Gemini CLI and the program I had it creating to close. 

Claude created a proper plan, and executed it when I was ready, but only when I was ready. The plan was very detailed and appropriate. It took a couple tries to get everything just right, but it succeeded.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I mean, that perspective would only make sense if Google was the only company on the planet developing AI

If you want to stop an apocalyptic or dystopian future caused by a rogue ASI (or an ill intentioned individual/company/government using an ASI), your only hope of winning is either making your own ASI first or having a decentralized fast take off **(hoping** that the gradual increase of small threats overtime will prepare humanity for dealing with big future threats). "Regulations" will only stop the big complying companies in the US, not the US government, other governments, other companies and individuals

Now, of course, I'm obviously not saying Google are the good guys who should 100% be trusted with ASI over everyone else. But if you do work at Google and you are well intentioned, it makes sense you wouldn't think "stop working on AI" is the solution</div>

I wanted to share a download I received on what enlightenment is. 



This is in the context of how enlightenment can be seemingly experienced as both a process and instantaneous, and the mechanics behind the paradox. 



\*This is just my perspective from my realisations, take or leave what resonates. 



Enlightenment is a paradox. Just like sepa...</div>

Quite a lot of readers have enjoyed the posts, reached out to me privately, and engaged in spirited commentary, so I share to similar groups who may enjoy it also.  Why would sharing a positive message about our innate being be contradictory to such a realisation?</div>

The illusion of the serpent's tail going into the serpent's head. It is real in 3D when we sit in meditation. The tail we eat is our own awareness spent on our body. But it is the same Being. She is the life that flows through everyone and everything. I see the Sierpinski's gasket fractal as one her signatures. The infinite yoni that appears inside a phallus emerging out of chaos.</div>

What exactly do you think it is that's being glimpsed which demonstrates this nonlocal foundation of awareness?   In other words, if meditation/nonordinary experience is providing some evidence to the system that disproves the illusion, what is the nature of the evidence?

(For what it's worth, I don't doubt what you're describing. And I wouldn't necessarily believe you less if you couldn't answer my question in words, aside from "go try it and see". But since you're here trying to put words to the experience, well, just thought I'd point out a significant piece that seems to be missing from the story.)</div>

As we chat about in the non-duality group, this seeing is beyond all words, concepts and logical understanding because the fundamental truth can't be seen, as in, all that is observable ultimately, isn't it... and yet because of the love and freedom we feel that arises out of it, we still try to talk about it anyway haha... 

In other words, I have no idea what IT is, other than simply 'being'.  
  
Send through your ideas too on what you feel was missed, as I'm sure I missed the main thing. But how would you describe it?</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Which seems nuts. Because Yang’s 2018 work addressed the planning we needed to do to be ready, and two administrations ignored it.

Andrew Yang’s The War on Normal People argues that automation is rapidly wiping out American jobs. Not just in factories, but also in retail, trucking, and even white-collar work. Unlike past disruptions, these jobs aren’t coming back.

The “normal” middle-class American life — steady job, homeownership, security — is already gone for many. Most people live paycheck to paycheck, and the economy doesn’t value essential but unpaid roles like caregiving or volunteering.

Capitalism is too focused on efficiency and shareholder value, ignoring human cost. As automation grows, millions may become economically irrelevant without a safety net.

Yang’s core solution is Universal Basic Income: $1,000 a month for every American adult. He claims it would reduce poverty, support local economies, and give people space to retrain, create, or care for others.

He also pushes for new ways to measure success beyond GDP, like mental health and community well-being.
