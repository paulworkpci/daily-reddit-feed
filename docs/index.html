                <div class="post-content">Given we've seen the new tariffs deals on Japan and the EU be set to 15%, wouldn't it be cheaper for Japanese and European OEMs to ship cars in from their respective countries/home factories rather than build factories in America?  Import on a foreign assembled car is 15%, but if a car is built in America, the materials would be subject to the 50% steel/aluminum/other materials tariffs.  And given we just saw GM post a billion dollar loss due to tariffs, wouldn't this just incentivize other car ...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed, but the question still stands.  If the tariffs on imports aren't at or near 50%, I feel like OEMs would still rather take the hit than invest a ton of money into building in America.

                                <div class="reply-body">The issue is how many of the parts are imported anyways if they assembled them domestically. Let’s say they spend billions in capex for an assembly plant here but not for their engine plants, body panel plants, and they still source tires, shocks/struts, gaskets, wire harnesses, etc. abroad they’re maybe still going to pay a tariff on 50% of the value of the vehicle while they also spent billions on a single plant. The math doesn’t work for anyone hence why these tariffs are ridiculous</div>

The current admin and president have shown tariffs can be applied and repealed on and off, like a light switch. 

There is no reoansable way for a manufacturer to plan a factory move with uncertainty that's being shown. It's both disrespectful, negligent, selfish and insane for the current admintno expect anything more than business waiting for something stable.</div>

I've been reading a lot about how meditation helps with trauma healing—and I genuinely want it to work for me. But sometimes it just makes everything louder. Sharing honestly here, wondering if anyone else feels the same.  
  
I know meditation is supposed to help. I’ve read the articles, watched the videos, heard the advice a hundred times. But here's the truth—when your entire brain is soaked in trauma, when every quiet moment becomes a battlefield filled with flashbacks, self-blame, or anx...</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">One important piece of this is that meditation doesn’t mean being calm. Like maybe someday it will, but it’s like going to the gym for a while and expecting to run a marathon. The present hurts, and trauma influences the things that come up, but the goal isn’t to stop that. It’s slowly, slowly to get a bit of distance from it. Trauma means certain scripts run all the time and those include body habits but over time meditation means at the beginning of the script you can start to say oh hey, there’s that script… that’s not a fact, that’s just a thought thinking itself. It’s not even my idea, I don’t have to believe it, or climb into the stream. You practice a thought and an emotion coming up and just letting it pop up without becoming the thinking road you head down, and slowly you start to get the skill of always noticing the second before you’re treating some nonsense your brain spit out on its own like it’s something true or something you believe or ruminating on it etc. So at the end of a session you might not be calmed, but you’re a little stronger in noticing the second before you’re already treating the thought or the emotion like it’s You and getting totally engaged in it.</div>

This is the path to a deeper longer lasting peace even if it takes time - to observe (and later, accept) the bad and the good, for a more equivalent state of mind.

Sure the net is full of physiological hacks for calming that is passed off as meditation (deep breathing etc) and they may even work but only temporarily.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I used to find it extremely difficult, but now it feels like a safe space for me.

It takes time and practice to feel at ease with the quiet, but it is absolutely worth it. 
For years, I relied on distractions and addictions to cope with the symptoms of trauma, PTSD, and CPTSD.

The best advice I can offer is to keep practicing embracing the quiet. When emotions come up, take deep breaths and allow yourself to cry, anger, grieve. Whatever you're feeling. 

I know that is much easier said than done, but letting yourself feel is powerful. Emotions come in waves, and when we allow them to move through us, we create space for healing.

Our brains actually release a comforting chemical after we cry, and it can feel like a real sense of relief.

Also, if meditation feels too hard to focus on, that is completely okay. What matters most is learning to feel safe in your body, to regulate your emotions, and to treat yourself with love and compassion &lt;3</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">what has helped me most in that area is daoist purification practices. Basically the aim is to tune in to those physical tensions/bracing of the body and release them. This bypasses the emotional and mental side of things and works to release trauma using the physical body as the initiator of release. There's more detail on the overall process here [https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueQiGong/comments/1gna86r/qinei\_gong\_from\_a\_more\_mentalemotional\_healing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueQiGong/comments/1gna86r/qinei_gong_from_a_more_mentalemotional_healing/)

As well as that when i couldn't do that/had done enough in a session, nature walks have been helpful, or just long walks in general. Also 'comfort tv' - watching old favorites, music, comedy &amp; games have given a breather between sessions.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">This. For meditation there are a lot of preparations. If you jump right into meditation without preparations it will be more difficult and probably less sustainable. Breath-work, trauma release and meditation go hand in hand in my personal experience.

Going into meditation without preparation is like having ice cold buckets of water splashed on you when ur sitting warm and cozy. Ur mind is going to resist meditation without preparation. Yogic limbs know this and each limb prepares you for intense meditation</div>

He’s like a dog in the sense that you can pretty easily guide his behavior because he doesn’t fully understand his own instincts, but at the end of the day he’s still a dog and might bite your kid unexpectedly.

If you’re the Murdoch family or one of the tech billionaires, you want someone you have more direct influence over, and that someone is JD Vance. Vance is only where he is because Peter Thiel willed him to be there, not because Vance is some advanced political thinker. And it’s coming time for Thiel and Murdoch to cash in on that investment they’ve made in Vance.</div>

The whole reason it's called "fuck you" money is that you can withstand attacks from anyone, even powerful figures like the president. And yet they're capitulating anyway, because they want a little bit more money.

If you're capitulating to get a little more money, your "fuck you" money is just "yes, Daddy" money.</div>

Im sure there are some exceptions, but speaking in broad strokes. They all eat so healthy 99% of the time and when they 'pig out' its so different than any of my regular friends. They do not drink a lot and when they do its so stereotypical, Liquor and Soad water vs beer/ mixed drinks. 1-2 at most never the 8-10 normies drink lol 

You can train for 4 hours a day every day, but if you dont eat right it will never matter.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">i agree with you from my experience. similar to sport performance itself, nutrition (for sports) becomes a bigger time investment, the further up in the leaderboards. So for nutrition the spectrum goes from a) not eating like a\*hole, to b) fuel for performance like a pro. And the majority is happy with a) what is sufficient to be and feel healthy but doesn't mean you turned into Aimee Cringle. Realistic is somewhere between a) and b).

The thing about the "look" that people will adapt their body into whatever is needed for the physical activity (given genetic constraints or preconditions). If people look more jacked like the norm, the question "is that achievable" is kind of answered: maybe but at low probability. That's also the reason why the "look" is a unique selling point of fitness influencers.</div>

&gt;Maybe. Probably not.

I dont agree with this because the full time work goes into not only looking like that but also performing in strength AND cardio for a Crossfitter. 

Look how much more insane female bodybuilder influencers look, even the ones claiming natural. THOSE are people paid to LOOK good.

Just LOOKING like that is like 50-70% as hard. Your diet needs to be every bit as good as them for body composition, but your training needs to be just bodybuilding.

I am factoring here that many of these pictures these women have ideal pumps and walk around traditionally looking mildly fluffier.</div>

but on top of that, natural or enhanced, ig influencers heavily stage and then edit their photo's. cutting diets for an upcoming shoot, makeup, lighting, then editing to enhance features further. it's far from 'real'.</div>

A few buzz words here, a few scientific sounded phrases there, and you can convince a majority of people who are ignorant into believing stuff and solidifying their unconscious bias opinion into something. Unless they have a solid foundation of what is being talked about, and if they can be emotionally targeted at all with something, they are more likely to grasp onto false claims that sound real, and breaking them of it is so much harder than to make them initially believe it.</div>

They heat up, air is forced through the hair dryer by its blower, which cools the heating elements down and prevents them from melting. The air gets hot and blown out the front and you're able to use it to dry your hair and other parts. The air inlet often has a screen that prevents hair and dust from entering the heating elements.

If you can see the air inlet, it’s taking the air directly from the immediate bathroom environment, heating it up &amp; then blowing it directly onto your lovely clean hands. These hand driers are known to actively increase bacterial contamination if used.

Luckily these are all but non-existent these days, bar the odd very old premises. The new variants of hand drier these days will almost always have an exterior inlet which pulls fresh air from outside. But still…stay vigilant out there!</div>

But I figured I should migrate over to Claude Code because, fuck if I know, cause it's getting a lot of buzz lately. Actually, I thought the iterative and multi agent processes running in parallel would be a game changer. Claude Code is doing a massive amount of things behind the scenes in running tools, spawning jobs, iterating, etc etc all in parallel. The hype seemed legit.

                        <div class="comment-body">I agree, Aider is great. I actually did use it with o4 mini for a time and had the same experience. Sadly it got a little forgotten in the hype of other cli tools. One of the biggest things that CC has going for it in my opinion is the flat pricing structure. I think that even when Claude isn’t the best model anymore people will just keep it because of the flat price. I was once using Gemini 2.5 pro with roo code before its cli tool got released and it had trouble editing a large html file several times in a row and that somehow cost about 10 bucks. I find it hard to believe that 100-200 dollar is the real long term price for CC.</div>

All the new trendy agentic stuff seems cool but like why do they all suck so bad? Every damn time I try to see if I’m missing out, I regret and something gets messed up and I go back to the BORING web chats without tools without mcp. Nothing is as good.. anytime an AI model gets tools to use it becomes too dumb - for solving problems you should have 100% of the intelligence available. Even 97% seems not good enough.

                        <div class="comment-body">Generally the code quality of o3 is higher than any claude models. But o3 is not agentic. It work well with aider . So for power users who take it step by step aider is indeed better . 

But when implementing a large feature , it takes a lot of time and handholding in aider. Where as with Claude Code , with  the right prompts and context, one can blaze through.

Generally use o3 for architecting and planning. Give the plan to Claude Code . Use o3 to review , claude code to test. While debugging use claude code to  prepare detailed bug report when it cannot fix on its own , and use o3 to find out the cause of the bug. 

tldr; use both :)</div>

It’s fantastic for showing a proof of concept or prototype. But that’s not my world. My code bases run core utility that millions of people depend on every day.

Do you mean o3 from the API/aider specifically ?

As a chatgpt pro user, o3 is incredibly stupid when compared to sonnet. Based on just their web interfaces. I wouldn't trust o3 with my code in that interface.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I have this personal theory that FSD will never be a large success story until all vehicles are robots, so, ubiquitous. Human drivers intermixed with robot drivers will always have limits and unpredictability. It's partially why I think elon leaned into the far-right when he did, to get the gas hogs on board - you can't just have all the college grads that understand the efficiency gains driving robots and meanwhile have this oil and gas opposition (roughly 50%).

Once all vehicles on the road are able to network, that's when real magic happens. 200+mph on highways because they all move in concert; your car will know what's going on 10miles ahead because of someone else's car,  etc.</div>

\- Kimi K2 was better in my tests so far

Your kid, your mom, your partner and seeing their name written in their own hand? That hits harder than any autograph ever could.
My idea: when you take a special photo with someone you care about, have them sign it. Doesn’t matter if it’s messy or silly or a scribble. Now you don’t just have a picture of them.

                                <div class="reply-body">Yup, this is a very common architectural direction being used for new agentic systems. Multiple agents with different prompts, different tool access, and sometimes using different models, cooperate within the system to achieve the overarching task. So some agents may break the task down and send the subtasks to new agents, some agents may execute the tasks (sometimes different agents for different types of tasks), and some agents may review the output of other agents to ensure they meet given standards. It's pretty cool stuff.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">At a minimum, both hemispheres of the brain are actually their own brains. This is known and has been for a long, long time.

One of the procedures to treat severe epilepsy involves severing the corpus collosum -- the bit that connects the two hemispheres of the brain. [This induces the split-brain syndrome.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain) The two sides cannot communicate easily anymore, leading to problems processing information when both sides aren't experiencing the same thing at the same time (such as with one eye covered or a hand doing something out of view of the eyes). 

However, notably, despite not knowing what's up, the hemisphere without experience will create post-hoc justifications as if it knew all along what it was doing -- which can lead to some absolutely nonsense justifications as the one hemisphere tries to tie its experience in with the other hemisphere's. This might seem familiar to you as an AI fan because LLMs do this too.</div>
