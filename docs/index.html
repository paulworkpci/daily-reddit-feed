Soros, rothchild, &amp; house of Saud have been defeated.

Soros recently gave up his empire to his son

Rothchild recently auctioned off tons of valuable belongings (for the first time) 

House of Saud has a new prince who imprisoned other royal family members to consolidate power

All 3 have been defeated.



Out with the old guard, in with the new guard.  The main difference, these 3 are in the public eye.  How many times have you ever heard rothchild or house of Saud speak publicly?</div>

Submission Statement: President Donald Trump recently directed his Chief of Staff, Susie Wiles, to “immediately” look into reports of drone activity in New Jersey. According to sources, Trump expressed a desire to quickly gather information on the situation to address public concerns. The directive reflects ongoing interest in unexplained aerial phenomena and the importance of providing clarity in response to such incidents.

Hell, imagine if you could even just ask Claude more than 5 questions a day.  99% of regular people dont know of any other LLM than ChatGPT 4o and judge AIs capabilities entirely off of it, they're not getting access to frontier models because we keep improving them but were not making them any cheaper.

Eventually did a half-marathon, still hating it. I trained so much and was promised I’d get addicted to it. Nope. Never happened. Never ran again. 

I think the trick is to keep trying different things until something clicks. So rock climbing and hula dancing keep me active but running will never be my friend.</div>

Just from within these two paragraphs, we have "This behavior is a testament to the ____, "as well as "It underscores the power and beauty of blah blah blah", and "This ___serves as a powerful reminder of ___" type sentence structures. LLMs overuse these similarly to the way they do in this post. 

Not saying that we conclusively know the authors used an LLM to help write the paper, but it certainly stinks of it for people who are used to using LLMs a lot.</div>

IMHO, there isn't enough here to conclude much.

With the limited evidence:  it tries approach #1, declares an "aha moment", and then repeats approach #1 again.

Rather than an "advanced reasoning technique", I'd call this... "Algebra 1".</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The two "..." is eliding an enormous amount of context.  The actual "Aha" is not described in the paper except that it occurred as the model was trained and captures a moment when the model learns to think longer.  (Try it at https://chat.deepseek.com/ -- not that it will have an aha moment but the chain of thought goes quite long)

Pure speculation, but I would guess that the model is learning its own uncertainty and learning to think more in response.</div>

Like many of you, I used to mindlessly scroll through social media whenever I had a few spare minutes - waiting for coffee, on the bus, or even (embarrassingly) on the toilet. One day, I calculated I was spending about 2.5 hours daily just... scrolling.

So I decided to try something different: replacing every social media urge with a 5-10 minute learning se...</div>

I don't disagree with your overall viewpoint on things and the sentiment, but if you're the president and you're trying to create an efficient surveillance state, you *definitely* want model testing results before the model release, and the power to enforce some action, steal the model, pull the model, or at least, something...

It's totally unaffected by the strength of partisan hysteria, so it's as though we're grabbing someone from 6 months ago, showing them the picture with no context and just asking "what do you see here?"

(I'm totally agnostic on the question of what Elon was thinking. But it's still useful to have a sort of sanity check to reassure us that it's not just some bad faith partisan attack - that it actually does kind of look like what people are saying it looks like.)</div>

A few weeks ago, a paper introduced Search-o1, a new type of agentic RAG that enables higher accuracy and smoother incorporation of retrieved information from the internet into chain-of-thought reasoning models, significantly outperforming models with no search or with normal Agentic RAG.

The general community believes o1-pro probably uses a Tree-of-Agents system, where many instances of o1 answer the question and then do c...</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Lol. OpenAI is fucking cooked. Open source is going to catch them on every battlefield. They raised too much money and have no defensible moats to speak of. 

- Dall-E? Stable Diffusion and Flux

- Sora? Hunyuan 

- o1? DeepSeek R1

Why would anyone build against OpenAI's API when the open source models are fully fine tunable, tweakable, and will gain wild new capabilities just as a function of being out in the open? 

Look at the image ecosystem that evolved around Stable Diffusion 1.5. ControlNets, easy fine tuning, LoRAs, ComfyUI, Civitai, etc. etc. 

The future of AI is open. It's just not "Open" AI.

Nowadays since we essentially reached human intelligence, people moved the goalposts and essentially conflate AGI and ASI.


Once you have an AI that surpass every humans at everything and can recursively self-improve, this is no longer "AGI", that's "ASI", and idk why people insist on mixing up the 2 concepts.</div>

I’m not one for productivity “hacks,” or apps. So I was surprised when the default daily “Reading Goal” displayed on my phone’s Books app (iPhone) motivated me to read more every day. I didn’t set this up intentionally - I just wanted quick access to a parenting book I was referring to as a new Dad so I set the widget up.

5 minutes isn’t a lot, but it’s enough to get started. ...</div>

2. Find titles you’re interested in.  
3. At some point, you just have to do it. Scrolling is habitual, almost like “muscle memory.” You have to be mindful enough to stop yourself in the moment and do something different. 
4. Start small. 5 minutes of scrolling is nothing, right? 5 minutes of reading is the same length of time.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Has anyone found a way around turning off youtube shorts or an app that turns them off? I’m open to paying for one. Or do you use a certain browser on your phone for youtube? 

I love youtube for yoga and asmr lol, as this is the healthiest app for me but I’ll admit my self control leaves my body when I unconsciously start the youtube shorts. I’ll get good at ignoring them but in times of stress it comes back and my best ways of habit breaking is removing the source from view. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">If you have an android phone you can use something called YouTube Vanced to remove shorts but it's in development and often buggy. I use extensions called Youtube Enhancer and Feed Eradicator on my PC. On my phone however, even with Vanced, I found that I would still surf YouTube all the damn time with shorts disabled, so I ended up just removing it from my phone altogether. If you have an iPhone, there's not much you can do, I'm afraid.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">My dry January is no Insta and no YT and very limited reddit. 
I was so hooked on shorts, had them on when I peed, when I had to wait for the water to boil. It‘s so freeing to not have the urge anymore! I have the app on my phone but since I have made these rules I don‘t touch it. 
I won‘t do no YT after January but I will do no shorts forever. They suck the life out of you.

TLDR: If you keep it up for 2 weeks you won‘t have the urge to watch them anymore!</div>
