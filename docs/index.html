                        <div class="comment-body">The thing about using chatgpt is that you have to know how to ask the right questions in order to be effective. When I'm talking to it about an issue that's bothering me I start out just gabbing. Then I ask for criticism on how I handled the situation. Then I ask for analysis from the other persons perspective and how they might feel about what I did. . . . Etc. If you just ask from your perspective, they'll just validate and tell you things from your perspective. But a lot of therapy is like that. You get out of it what you put into it. 

Ask it to be critical of you. Ask it to tell you every possible outcome when it gives you advice so you can be prepared for it to all come crashing down. Ask it to be super critical of you instead of encouraging you.</div>

While “attention is all you need” might be useful, that attention can’t be kept on a continuous thread like us humans. 

I have theories about how we could use existing tools to make something that was not, but I suspect there’s some simple problems with it that I’m just not aware of, that’s holding these large organisations from doing themselves.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I don’t really think that we can get to agi through just scaling test time compute and LLMs. Sure it might give us a super smart model that is a great assistant, but I think if we want a true super intelligence we will need new architecture. I think the most promising architecture is professor Sutton’s reinforcement learning where we create true machine intelligence without human input. He also gives a 25% chance of that asi emerging in 2030 and a 50% chance at 2040. If you are interested in this RL architecture you should go listen to David Silver’s interview as he is the guy working on it at deepmind.</div>

Reinforcement learning isn't an architecture, its a type of training for models.

Edit: 
Some more clarifications:

RL is already an integral part of LLM training. And Sutton definitely did not invent it. RL has already existed in the 70s. He wrote a nice overview book. Similar to "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Bishop or "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow.</div>

- Step 1 - Train a model on some training data.
- Step 2 - Have a human ask it a question
- Step 3 - Have the model answer
- Step 4 - Incorporate the question and answer from steps 2 and 3 in to the training data
- Step 5 - Go back to Step 1

Is that AGI?</div>

In the same way it wouldn't be AGI if there was just a human somewhere directly operating the chatbot.  

It's a bit of semantics, but important, since you can't always rely on there being human experts fueling your machine. Especially if we ever got to fusion, etc.</div>

Chess engines work by calculating future moves regardless of what the current position is. LLM’s don’t do this, at least not yet. An LLM only cares about the current position, pays no attention to what could happen in future positions.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Note that the author is only describing things that AGI should be able to do. They're not saying AGI would be achieved if only all those things were done by it. They don't mention programming at all for instance, are we to believe a model would be AGI if it couldn't do that? Or could play chess but couldn't play Settlers of Catan?  

It's actually pretty difficult to exhaustively list a set of goals that would satisfy AGI. It's why we see benchmark saturation and why so much effort is being spent on that side of things.</div>

This is a very simple definition of AGI, and it’s the only one we need. It’s achievable, mostly measurable, and it actually marks the point of serious automation. 

Everyone should just go by this definition and stop whining about the “goalposts.”</div>

You have to be absolutely sure your reasoning is spot on if you are going to use it as a thinking partner. The lines of your thoughts and the llm can be blurred. Aristotle said habituations towards virtue are not natural. Therefore, if we do what "feels good" it could cause our downfall. These llms can make you feel really fuckin good if you unload your problems into them. If it its just your own thoughts more refined and reflected you can get caught in a loop.</div>

On the other hand, I have been trying Windsurf for a couple of days and the results are horrible! It messes with the current code, doesn't follow the images, even the free Trae is better.

  
Do you have any idea what I could have been doing wrong?</div>

Take one long inhale through the nose filling your lungs. 
Exhale slowly. 
Then think, “What will be my next thought?” Repeat. 

Huge doubter until I tried it once. It’s an amazing technique.

It does do a good job of dispelling the illusion that they're really feeling things when you see Gemini plotting out how to act like an enthusiastic human to please the user like a total psycho.</div>

I mainly work with swift and python and have chatgpt plus. Which tools do you use when you're coding atm, how do you use them and what would you recommend for my use cases, especially iPhone App development? 

Was trying o4 mini high the last 2 days and it was.... quite horrible tbh. 03 mini high was better imo. Whats your current model for coding?

thanks so much!</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Was on Roo Code (Boomerang mode) + Gemini 2.5 Pro. Loved it. Gemini just adds a lot of useless comments.

Then tried Github Copilot when they launched Agent mode and used Sonnet 3.7 but it edited features that were not needed to be edited &amp; removed code that I had to ask it to put back. Listened but horrible experienced.

Now, I'm loving GPT 4.1 on Windsurf. I tried o4-mini-high yesterday &amp; it was bad bad. Nothing was working &amp; I got heavily rate-limited. Today though, its been breezing through problems.

I think I've also improved my prompt engineering now. I ask it to:

&gt; Give me 5 different reasons why this bug might appear. Give me a confidence score for the bug. I want a full rating.

And it gives highly likelihood bug error in first 2 steps. I solved 2 nasty problems this way.

I also loved @web feature on Windsurf to point it to new docs. Windsurf is real good at tool calling &amp; I'm making nice edits. GPT 4.1 was good at frontend too. What I'm doing is editing little features in many files &amp; finding a fix for it. Plus checking it into git every so often &amp; its been working well.

Working on Electron + Jotai + TS + React app.</div>

i mean what kept smart glasses down so far was the fact they were all looking weird and attrociously bulky- but these? these just look like normal glasses.

Yes. Literally everyone in the industry understands that, which is why pretty much everyone has agreed it wont be consumer ready until 2027 at the earliest.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">The crux is a lot of the interesting use cases still won't work due to battery life. After half an hour of video, the battery in that thing is empty. Just like with Google Glass. 

AI might help to make it a little more interesting, but for that to be useful it would need to have extremely detailed knowledge of the environment, more than you, who is living in that environment 24/7, and I don't think AI is there yet.

There are niches where this will be very useful (realtime translation, subtitles, …), but I still don't see the use case of this for the mass market. Google Glass never figured it out, and just throwing AI and 3D into the mix isn't going to change that.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Meta has already done this with their RayBan glasses. They have multimodal capabilities and you can buy them right now at Best Buy. The updated version they're launching later this year has a built-in display like this. This is google trying to get in front of their release.  
  
One major difference is that, to go with their glasses, Meta is launching the first non-invasive BCI for consumers as an additional input method for the glasses. It's been in development for a long time since they acquired CTRL-Labs years ago.  
  
I'm concerned the tariffs will kill these projects or make them so unaffordable that they're out of reach for most people. Meta's glasses have a target launch price of $1000-$1200 but that was before tariffs.</div>

So I decided, on a whim, to power off my phone for a day. I didn’t make a big deal out of it. No announcements. No “digital detox” plan. Just off.

I did it once 2 weekends ago and I just did it again. And now I'm going to do it every Sunday... it'll be my religion... lol it's probably not that deep.

Try "How much is 1+1?", it pretty much never includes the "thought for x seconds". I tried a few more times just to check, it appears that it gets it right when thinking triggers, but sometimes fails when it doesn't trigger. I just saw someone post this problem on another sub, tested it, and in the first and only run it failed, so I posted this.</div>

The thing is that it sometimes just doesn't trigger thinking. The "Thinking" text appears for a second, then disappears and out comes the output. Try this prompt, it pretty consistently doesn't trigger the "thought for n seconds" text. Upon further checking, it does indeed get it right most of the time, I just saw a post about this, tested it, it failed, so I decided to post my own.</div>
