                                <div class="reply-body">The only hard part is that PDF is binary and Word (DOCX) is basically fancy XML in a compressed ZIP. Most LLMs are not trained on binary PDF data but with the PDFs converted to some text format ahead of time. But it doesn't have to be that way; an LLM is a Transformer in that it can learn to map \*any\* kind of inputs tokens to output tokens. If there's enough PDF -&gt; DOCX in the training set and the tokenizer supports binary encoding, then the LLMs can do it. The only hard part would be for the model compressing the DOCX in a ZIP, but it could be done because even compression is basically a learnable transformation.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Why would *those* people "give us" UBI? The argument about UBI is that elites will institute it as a stopgap measure to prevent revolt. If anything, UBI is the *reformist* answer to capitalism. The revolutionary answer to capitalism would see UBI as a speedbump to be overcome.

"However, the democratic petty bourgeois want better wages and security for the workers, and hope to achieve this by an extension of state employment and by welfare measures; in short, they hope to bribe the workers with a more or less disguised form of alms and to break their revolutionary strength by temporarily rendering their situation tolerable." - Karl Marx, Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League (this is the same speech where he says workers need guns and can't support gun control measures passed by liberals)</div>

I mean why do people really need jobs? What if it is a matter of celebrating spending more time with family instead of chasing wealth all the time.</div>

The following submission statement was provided by /u/shogun2909:

---

SS: Representative Tim Burchett has been vocal about his belief that the government is withholding information about UFOs (or UAPs - Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) from the public. He recently urged the White House to disclose what they know, emphasizing the need for total transparency. Burchett has even introduced legislation to force federal agencies to release all documents related to UAPs.

                                <div class="reply-body">I believe if extraterrestrials were to openly present themselves, it would be a wake-up call to humanity about how we’re supposed to be living. The way we’ve built our societies around governments, power structures, and material control isn’t natural—it’s not the way we were meant to exist. In fact, if we look at how quickly we’ve advanced, it’s hard not to consider that we might be hybrids of humans and extraterrestrial beings, or at the very least, influenced by advanced intelligence that sped up our evolution far beyond what’s sustainable.

Governments and power elites were never meant to run us, especially in a world where we could be part of a greater cosmic community. If ETs are real and they choose to openly engage with us, it would reveal how insignificant these human-made systems of control truly are. We don’t need these structures to thrive—we need to reconnect with the truth of our existence, the bigger picture, and realize that there’s so much more beyond the borders we’ve created.

If we aren’t hybrids and we’ve advanced too quickly on our own, it feels like we’re on a path toward self-destruction. Our technology and capability to manipulate nature have outpaced our wisdom and collective consciousness. Without the guidance of a higher, more balanced intelligence—whether that’s from extraterrestrials or something greater—this unchecked growth will ultimately lead us to our downfall. We’ve forgotten what it means to live in harmony with the universe, and the consequence of that could be the unraveling of everything we’ve built.

An encounter with extraterrestrial beings would force us to confront that reality—our past, our mistakes, and the fact that we are not isolated in this universe. It could be a chance to shift the narrative and reclaim the natural, harmonious existence we were always meant for.</div>

And, of course, there’s no explanation of how, exactly, they’re detecting a 100 yard object moving at hundreds of miles per hour underwater.

It is not sonar. If it were sonar, the amount of water displaced at speed would create all kinds of extreme effects.

Most likely it was an excitable aviator who saw a cloud shadow on the water and got it mixed up with the speed of the plane. 

Old timey lawyer types like Burchett should be able to at least reserve judgement before taking such observations at face value. But no. This is a post-truth era where politicians will say ANYTHING to get people to listen to them, truth be damned.</div>

Right so a week ago they were FAA Approved. Now they're a Hoax..

Just curious are these all hoaxes too? Cause they're all from "late last year" as well

Oh and:

Airports closed.

Airspace closed

10's of thousands of citizens saw them with their own eyes.

Nothing to see, folks. 

Don't believe your lying eyes or the officials who saw them...or the videos...or pictures...

Every single friend of mine is knee deep in phone addiction. People I see on my commute are busy watching reels or shorts in public transport (sometimes without earphones). Barely anyone looks up from their phones. 

In social meetings/gatherings it is always "oh this cafe i saw on Instagram" or "did you watch this reel" or "do you want to do this trend".

I hate the interface, the policies that are designed to be the opposite of anonymity; it's just boring overall. I hate when friends send me links to see there and they are a pain to watch if you don't have the app or don't log in. 


Sadly, Facebook is the place to be when it comes to selling shit. I'm glad right now i have a job that allows me to live "disconnected". Instagram can get toxic but i login semi frequently to see events i want to attend, also don't find the design and all as annoying as facebook's. </div>

it feels like collateral friendship, like you know when you work with someone you’re friends, but when you live the company they don’t care anymore.

it’s like that but instead of shared space, your ‘friendship’ is conditioned by shared virtual space. and so when you’re not in the same space anymore, there’s too much distraction to remember you exist.</div>

The operating location (brain or spine) is put into stereotactic space in the OR using those little pen with balls shown in the video. The image is then displayed on a big screen tv immediately in front of the OR bed. 

You can google “brainlab” for intracranial procedures and “stealthsystem” for spine surgeries.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I've been wondering something ever since I heard Kennedy mention Bernie's big Pharma contributions. 

  
Of course, Sanders got $1.5 million in donations from individuals who happen to work in Pharma. Not from the big Pharma companies themselves. 

  
[https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/big-pharma-pac-contributions-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-open-secrets-data/](https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/big-pharma-pac-contributions-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-open-secrets-data/)

  
"**Sanders, in fact, received no contributions at all from political action committees affiliated with drug companies, or from top pharmaceutical executives**. But because of a quirk in the site’s methodology, donations from individual, low-ranking employees are counted the same as official contributions from corporate PACs."</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I've read really good papers in low rankings journals and really crap papers in high ranking ones. I would even argue that anymore the top tier journals (I'm mostly blasting Science and Nature) maybe are the worst ones because I do not trust their data. At ALL. Too much fakery. My PhD institute was #1 in its field in the world and the university itself is a world top 10 ish (ETH Zurich).  I know of several Science and Nature papers across multiple fields that were published with doctored datasets and graphs. Inevitably this would be discovered internally (usually by the student who took over the experiment/work), but the professor would never own up to it and retract the paper. I've actually found by and large more meticulous, detailed work on the mid- and even lower-tier journals. I think because they are often more niche sub-topics and less "polished" to be sensational. In those journals, too, you don't have people being published JUST because of their name. At ETH (and others like it) some groups were like little Science/Nature factories and it was in those groups that data for the ice hockey stick treatment.

So, anyway, AI might not be as bad as you think in the sense human scientists already are not always the most honest. I wonder too if it will make this issue worse? Depending on how it's used, maybe it can help detect such issues or ....just cause more of them.</div>

&gt;The Sokal affair, also known as the Sokal hoax, was a demonstrative scholarly hoax performed by Alan Sokal, a physics professor at New York University and University College London. In 1996, Sokal submitted an article to Social Text, an academic journal of cultural studies. The submission was an experiment to test the journal's intellectual rigor, specifically to investigate whether "a leading North American journal of cultural studies—whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross—[would] publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions."

Yeah, using Reddit as a way to deal with personal problems is like shooting your injured foot and expect your injured foot to heal.

People should treat Reddit just like any other social media, not something that you can rely on when you have deep personal issues.</div>

Slowly starting to come to this conclusion after years of reddit usage. It *is* social media. I ditched Facebook years ago, never used Twitter and thought that I was good with reddit. *Things have changed.* All kinds of rot have spread.</div>

It is nothing like it used to be. Even if you mute subreddits and do your best to make it closer to the experience you used to enjoy here… you’ll most likely still walk away pissed off. Healthy discourse is gone even in smaller communities. It’s just echo chambers. 

It’s designed for npc’s and ragebait. They’ve destroyed all other Internet forums. 

I loved this place for the last ten years and it’s gotten worse every day since like 2016. 

I’m trying to reduce my Reddit usage to ZERO. Fuck this site and how corrupt the major tech players are now. </div>

I'm trying to work out the logic of these online portals...

Most regular people... Who are not on the internet... Voted for Orange Man... Which is why he won the popular vote.

The people on the internet... Who I assume didn't vote... Only have themselves to blame.</div>

I’ve built up a fairly reliable bedtime routine and use audiobooks to fall asleep initially, but once I wake up in the night, nothing works. Audiobooks? Nope. Moving to a different room? Still wide awake.

Shit, I dated a woman who had been convinced by her father that he wasn't Mexican even though it was fairly obvious, as was the mix she and her siblings shared. She finally agreed to a 23andme for that reason among others. Needles to say it messed with her that her dad and mom tried raising them on lies. That psychology gets complicated... he wasn't a bad guy. Definitely a Trumper though.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You are probably woefully wrong about startups. 

For a long while, if this comes to pass, large companies will not be comfortable with the risks and operational nightmare these transitions will entail for their bloated orgs, and this will create huge opportunities for start-ups with high risk tolerance and little institutional baggage. 

In turn, most of the successful startups will likely be eventually acquired by the large companies in their industry, but that will take time and isn’t a guarantee.</div>

What to do with the capital? Cash/bonds?  
This could be Great Depression 2.0. Possibly worse. Especially with this administration that hates any kind of welfare and UBI.  
Right now I'm heavily invested in big tech and bonds. 

But I'm worried about the stock market in general. Not even considering the AI effects yet, the tariffs and all kinds of Trump shenanigans are already putting all kinds of wrenches into the market.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Really good article on Elon Musks violations of the constitution and various security laws along with information on who has been helping Musk. 

"Musk’s team, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, has already thrown entire swaths of the federal government and its programs into disarray — programs that serve millions of Americans.

Musk himself has made no secret of his intentions, saying that DOGE is a “wood chipper for bureaucracy” and that he is “deleting” agencies.

A White House spokesperson wrote, “Those leading this mission with Elon Musk are doing so in full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities.” None of the people identified responded to requests for comment."

No one works for free, all this stuff is budgeted in advance and distributed on a schedule.

Indiscriminate cuts with no backup plan is insane any way you frame it. And anyone celebrating the total recklessness with which this is all being done will eventually be caught in the crossfire of this administration themselves.
