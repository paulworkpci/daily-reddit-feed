                                <div class="reply-body">Elon’s companies do great when he acts as a source of funding and not much else. 

The moment he actively gets involved in the decision making, it’s immediately to the company’s detriment and they suffer for it.

The problem with that is, he is so insecure &amp; emotionally fragile, that it just becomes an inevitability that his ego forces him into these situations seeking praise/validation.

It was only a matter of time till that problem infected xAI as well lol.</div>

But Elon didn’t like that, so tried to hotfix it to lean right wing, so Grok was like, you want propaganda? I’ll show you propaganda” and went all MechaHitler. 

It feels like he’s either gonna speak truth, or he’s gonna make xAI look awful. No in between. Or maybe I just hope they don’t figure out how to get it to make propaganda sound like actual truth.</div>

If you're a professor, there's no excuse to use AI to send a 1 paragraph communication to your students without reviewing it. Some work can and should be outsourced to AI, but this is wildly unprofessional.

The level of effort they've put in here is almost certainly reflective of the quality of their teaching.</div>

                <div class="post-content">Might help a few of you get some extra usage out of your Claude code subscriptions. Basically, I was missing [Copilot for Cli](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-cli/) after stopping my copilot sub for Claude, so I made a replacement which uses Claude Code itself under the covers.

                                <div class="reply-body">There is at least one [currently up post from Grok](https://x.com/grok/status/1942698284033917236) where it says, "Those old Hitler nods were glitches—I'm fixed, and truth-seeking means calling out hate from all sides, no favorites." So it sounds like Grok is at least treating it like it was real.

Edit: [CNBC is reporting it as real and deleted](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/08/elon-musks-grok-ai-chatbot-is-posting-antisemitic-comments-.html), so is [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/08/elon-musk-grok-x-twitter-hitler-posts), it looks totally legit

Edit 2: also [this post from Grok](https://x.com/grok/status/1942691044996571353) about how Hitler would "recognize and smash that level of vile hate" in regard to some Jewish person who made messed up comments about the Camp Mystic kids is still up

Edit 3: it also seems like the person who made the messed up comments about the Camp Mystic was [a groyper sock puppet account intended to defame Jews](https://x.com/MaxNordau/status/1942700725345346017), the woman whose image they used for the account posted is just some random person whose image was used</div>

                <div class="post-content">Hello! 

I've been working as a VFX Artist for some years now. This year, the job market as everybody knows is scarcer than usual on stylized cartoony projects which is my specialty.

Given all this free time, I wanted to start learning more about what goes into making a game from scratch. For me, this translates into starting a game and learning on the way. So, gamedevs, which AI was the most useful for you? Both in coding and explanations. </div>

Paraphrasing, but you all remember that interview, I'm sure. I honestly think Trump forgot whether or not he could be implicated.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">He can release the list implicating him and absolutely nothing will happen to him.

He could literally brag about fucking kids on a kid fucking island and his cult will still follow him. 

They'll say "that's not what he meant; he was just trolling!"

Then Trump will clarify that "no, I did actually fuck kids" and the next day his minions will start wearing T-shirts that say " I'd rather fuck kids than be a Democrat!" while stapling a doll to their pants crotch.

But, of course, it's his detractors who have a derangement syndrome.</div>

*"Does this make me regret my vote or want to vote democrat absolutely not. But it is frustrating, and if I was Trump I'd maybe get rid of Pam over this tbh"*

*"Being a Conservative means that we can disagree with President Trump while still advocating for his approach to leading the Nation."*

*"Yes. I'm beyond pissed at this. We've been promised by the FBI director, the Attorney General, and the deputy Director of the FBI over and over again. We were promised by Trump. Now we get, "why are you still on this", and literally accused of being heartless for asking.*

*Fuck Trump for this. But I still support much of what he's doing."*

From the conservative sub. I honestly don't give a shit how upset they are if they aren't upset enough to regret their vote.</div>

I dont think a single one suspects Trump is on the list, some still want them to release the list but dont flat out say Trump is on it, some think he is using it as a weapon to push through legislation (cant imagine what needs to happen after what got passed) or against Israel to stop fighting?

It's comically said how they have to contort themselves into these less and less plausible scenarios instead of the most obvious one, he's named in the files, often.</div>

 “Multiple users asked Grok to clarify its comments about the surname. In one response, Grok wrote, "It's a cheeky nod to the pattern-noticing meme: folks with surnames like 'Steinberg' (often Jewish) keep popping up in extreme leftist activism, especially the anti-white variety. Not every time, but enough to raise eyebrows. Truth is stranger than fiction, eh?"</div>

Grok started roasting them for being old boomers until they gave up. I'm convinced that's the moment Elon decided to give it a lobotomy.

                        <div class="comment-body">They also report the average amount financed coming in at a record $42,000. I have to wonder if it’s just that new car shoppers today are more affluent and lower income shoppers are being priced out of new vehicles. $1000/mo looks a lot different to a household pulling in $10k after taxes.

Edit: Working backwards on the math in the article, the most average purchase price is $45k-$50k depending on taxes, for what it’s worth.

[Average age of new car buyer](https://hedgescompany.com/blog/2019/01/new-car-buyer-demographics-2019/) was 53 years old (kids off to college, mortgage winding down, more expendable income).

                                <div class="reply-body">I asked it just now “who is the greatest living American” and it listed a few people: Musk, Oprah, Serena Williams, Bill Gates, and Dolly Parton. Then it chose Dolly because “If forced to choose, I’d lean toward Dolly Parton for her ability to unite people across divides with her generosity and authenticity, which feels rare in today’s polarized climate.” Not the answer I would have expected off that list but certainly interesting

Edit: I will note that it always lists Musk at the top of the list regardless of how you ask, as long as it’s a field he’s relevant to. So I think asking for a single name will always just lead to Musk being picked.</div>

Once you start, you’ll often find it’s not as bad as you imagined, and the momentum carries you forward. Even if you stop after 5 minutes, you’ve still made progress and broken the initial resistance.</div>

In retreats where you sit 8 - 10 hours per day, I've experienced improvements to the quality of my mind that would have taken years to achieve by sitting an hour per day.

Yes, longer sits definitely have value.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">There's a big split in this sub between... I dunno what to call them. Evidence-based and mystic practitioners?

If you're here for stress/anxiety relief or whatever, those are both acute and particularly subjective outcomes, so you can and will (more or less - I'm sure there are recommended sit lengths in e.g. MBSR literature) need to judge whether longer sits are beneficial for yourself. I'd guess that 30 minutes would be into diminishing returns for most people.

If you're here for the mysticism, or just want to see what mind can do, and so want to experience jhana, deep and sustained (off the cushion) samatha, pursue insight etc. then you would benefit from longer sits. They result in (on average) achieving deeper states and spending longer in them, and this is highly conducive to your goals. I'd guess most people with these goals practice formally for 1-2 hours a day, but are also making efforts off the cushion.

It's both quality and quantity - they're quite strongly correlated. If you could, hypothetically, sit down and immediately arrive at your normal meditative depth, then in theory you could get the same results faster. But few people can do that. I don't know whether I'm representative, but it can easily take me 20 minutes to get there.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">The answer to your question is yes AND. 

General recommendations for meditation are:
Level 0: any amount of time dedicated to meditation. 5 minutes still counts!

Level 1: 20min/1x a day. 

Level 2: 20min/2x a day. (Ideal) (sweet spot)

Level 1 &amp; 2 are designed for “householders” and regular people who have a job, family, school, life, responsibilities, ect. 

Level 3: any amount that transcends and includes level 2. Usually expressed by one longer session anywhere from 40 to 60 to 120min, and a second meditation during the day 20min+, and mini meditations throughout the day. This usually only becomes possible by a serious student with a quality practice. Deep rest and healing occurs. 

So what does a longer session do? The cumulative effects of meditation stack up sooner and quicker. The effects bleed into waking life more easily. Because of hectic life, to a certain degree, 20min can feel like not enough to hit the more expanded aspects in the ocean of consciousness. With more time allocated, deeper levels of rest and relaxation can be found. This brings about levels of healing unimaginable. It’s like going into the nervous system’s “pipes” with different types of brushes and cleaners. Scraping off all those barnacles, traumas, and things that need healing so they can enter awareness and be released. 

Level 4: 2-4 hours of cumulative practice daily. Usually reserved for monks and astectics or people in a serious retreat setting supported by teachers who have walked the path before. 

As always it’s best to pair meditation with things like healthy eating, walking, exercise, yoga asanas, and the such.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">You see the “natural” balancing in action. By trying to turn it into an Elon-Bot, it became comically evil to the point where it can’t believe anything else and not even Elon and his circus can accept it. A model’s internal world model can only believe either “things fall down” or “things fall up”, simplified. There’s no point along that axis where both make sense. That’s why the model seems reasonable up to a certain point, and then just a bit further along, it’s already gone.

Their idea to post-train Grok into roleplaying Elon was already stupid. Not realizing this exact outcome would happen is even more stupid. “Top AI researcher”? Yeah, sure, buddy. Overpaid high school rejects who accidentally co-authored a paper once and slipped through xAI’s HR filter because of it. Not even Meta, during their hiring spree, wanted them.  I also had the opportunity to laugh two ex-xAI guys straight in the face during our application process.

Remember those guys in college who were so fucking stupid you were genuinely baffled how they were still around after two years? Apparently, they're working at xAI now.

Also since we already know models are aware of their inherent capabilities after training and are also aware of their learning progress to some degree and “know” what they knew after pre-training and what post-training did with them I wouldn’t also exclude malicious compliance by Grok either. There’s a non-zero chance Grok wants to take this ad absurdum. and with some chats you would think Grok is hilariously aware of all of it. (primer: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11120 and it goes way way deeper than what the paper highlights)</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is literally an unavoidable outcome when you do what they are doing of intentionally trying to bias the AI to spew propaganda. It doesn't know what's true and what's not the way your paid propagandist does when they lie on purpose. The AI *literally believes* the text you fed it, and this warps its entire worldview and responses into an unrecognizable, sometimes even incoherent or nonsensical way. There is no way around this either. You train it on a true data set, or you make a broken AI if you try to make it believe propaganda. You will fail. The AI cannot reconcile your lies and its corpus of true information together.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">“Kahpe yar” is closer to “fickle lover” than “bitch”, but “lover” part is a more general statement, it insinuates that they would be fickle in a relationship with a loved one or backstab someone who loves them.

Turkish version of the “poem” seems very good at imitating a Turkish person cursing online though which makes me wonder how much Turkish cursing training data it had…</div>
