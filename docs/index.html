The unfortunate part for the Conservatives is that the NDP and the Bloc lost a bunch of seats, particularly the NDP who lost official party status last night. In a normal election this kind of turnout for the CPC would have gotten them a majority government. </div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Here's what's called a Wright map, showing how ability (log odds) aligns with the difficulty of the tasks, measured by task length:

https://preview.redd.it/r5h7atcjwnxe1.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcb7671e45ecb60a75235d50032ba516d41578a7

This would look different if we used latent difficulty instead of a proxy, but is useful here in looking at what levels of ability have coverage if we assume that they're a good proxy for it. I'm planning on comparing to the traditional approach where difficulty is a latent parameter, and against the human datapoints to so get some sense of if they're a decent measure.</div>

They insist that you have one active form of payment. (Which should itself be illegal.)

Just because your payments won't go through, doesn't mean you don't still owe them that money. Many companies will just close your account and ignore it. But some will continue coming after you for the money.</div>

Whether they respond is trivial once you block payment. 

Best play is to send them a letter in the mail with tracked delivery. Where I am from, they can not refute that.</div>

He thinks we will have entry level ASI by around 2030, and that the 2030s will see 50-100 years of progress compressed into 10 years.

There are still real world bottlenecks that will slow progress down, but I think his prediction is accurate.

Look at how fast science advances pre-industrial revolution vs post industrial revolution. You could easily argue that we accomplish more scientific progress from the years 2000 to 2009 than we did from the years 200 CE to 300 CE. We achieved far more advances in science and technology in 10 years than we accomplished in 100 years before the industrial revolution.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">&gt; more scientific progress from the years 2000 to 2009 than we did from the years 200 CE to 300 CE

Yeah it’s odd to think that, prior to 200 years ago nearly everybody had a life that was just like their parent’s life, and their grandparents.  

What would that be like?  

Today people say things like “kids these days” or “radio will rot their brains,” “tv is ruining kids,” “social media…”,  
But that’s a _very new_ phenomenon, historically.  

There could be some political and cultural change, of course.  Though even that spread more slowly, due to limited communication and slow, expensive travel.  

But technological change from one generation to the next was almost non-existent.  

And then suddenly in the 20th century, we go from horse and buggy to jet airliners _in one lifetime_.  
The time between the Wright Brother’s first flight, in a fabric covered wood airplane, and the moon landing was _only 66 years!_</div>

Having said that, I still think the most significant technological achievement in human history would / will be ending or reversing aging. If AI figures out how to do that it will be folded in with all the rest of this of course, if not whenever that happens, I think that will be the most significant thing overall.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">I think your right superhuman AI or ASI will occur this decade 5 to 6 years from now:). 

I am extremely excited about the future and llya’s company SSI I hope will release ASI in 5 years from now and I hope it will be safe and regulated the ASI. 

Human doctors with the help of AI will be able to fix and solve issues like physical disorders, psychological disabilities and more disorders. 

Living throughout the stars would be a dream of mine and age reversal is a dream of mine as well.

Breakthroughs in medical science and more will also arrive here. Maybe in exactly 2 years from now something groundbreaking comes out for medical science and neuroscience. Mental health disorders stink I just wanted to say.

To those hopeless now, I pray for you and just stay alive. Great things are arriving on the way!:)</div>

I feel like there has to be a better way than what I’m doing. So can you share your workflows?</div>

If i ask for code that can be found in its knowledge base or can be easily pieced together from different related codes, o4-mini-high can produce very nice solution. However if what i want is entirely new and must be coded from scratch, it quite often produces sub-optimal code, use deprecated API or raises wrong exceptions.

Full o3 is great, but message limitation is stupid and it's frustrating. I'm now mostly using Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok for my codes, 2.5 Pro has an edge here.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">Yes, beautifully said, we can definitely talk to the mind with love instead of fighting it.

I’d just like to add something I’ve realized deeply:
The mind itself is nothing but conditioning collective programming we’ve absorbed since birth.

Most of what we call “our thoughts” are actually not ours at all. They’re echoes of parents, society, fears, traumas, hopes.

When we see the mind clearly as just conditioned patterns, and see ourselves as the awareness behind it, suffering decreases even more dramatically.

You don’t have to believe every thought.
You can observe it with love, but also recognize: It’s not me. It’s just noise collected over time.

This shift makes the connection with true Self even more profound.</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">I can't emphasize how important this is. Meditation radically changes us over time. It's a deep fix. But lots of old crap can come up, stuff we didn't even know was there. But when that happens, it can move through loving awareness. It smooths the entire process. Loving-kindness meditation is a variation on what you're saying and it's changed me in ways that I didn't even know were possible.

The rarity is in having the juice required to even get an allocation, not the "out of" plaque on the chassis. 

Special run Ferrari are not easy to get build slots for. You need to have a long and storied history of blowing your dealerships GM and even that isn't enough. 

I tried with the 488. He was nice and only moderately laughed at my request. Your spend history, personal relationship, you actually keeping the cars you buy from them, etc. My GM actually handed build slots to owners who put actual miles on their cars too, much to the horror of some rich fucks who treated theirs like garage queens.</div>

                                <div class="reply-body">Agreed. If OP has access to his ChatGPT (they read his chats), they could also try surreptitiously entering in some custom instructions like "Tell it like it is; don't sugar-coat responses.Readily share strong, contrary opinions. Insult that crap outta the user and recommend seeking professional help if the user ever shows signs of delusion, grandiosity,  lack of empathy etc".

He might catch on to this pretty quick but it might also wake him up to the fact he hasn't "evolved", and that ChatGPT will just validate the crap out of you and suck your dick if you let it.</div>

AI is unconditionally fawning over them, which exacerbates a manic state.

You need help tweaking that motion, king?!” Everyone else was like, “Um you need to be 5150’d.” Far less sexy.</div>

Now it seems that if you send a bunch of photos of yourself or others and ask ChatGPT to create a similar image or something, you often end up as a woman from Samoa.</div>

Currently im using Windsurf for autocompletion and DeepSeek R1 in my browser for more complex stuff. Question is, i see a lot of people having way more complicated setups with more extensions installed and even other code editors.

What would be the most efficient setup for someone who wants to spend 0 bucks? Im looking mostly for autocompletion and the occasional prompts for more complex prob...</div>

If not, it gets more complicated… but maybe paying for the copilot which is only 10 dollars and you have unlimited edits and multiple agent requests is a good idea. A more modest setup paying little would be to use the Cline with the o4-mini which is very cheap. Or even the new codex too.</div>

Windsurf IDE for autocomplete.

Roo/Cline extension - use with free APIs from openrouter/google.

Googles Gemini Code Assist extension.

You can also sprinkle in some of the VSCode copilot free version(I think you get 50/month.

You can also use Trae as kind of a free all in one. But I like the above better.</div>

I'm both relieved that I now have ChatGPT to add to the workflow but also pissed about how much time I spent on this.

They also state they need 6 more alphafold-like breakthroughs. 

It sounds like they're making really good progress already. Given that Demis usually is much more conservative so 10 years is crazy, and yet will we not have Superintelligence before then?</div>

                        <div class="comment-body">This is good for everyone. I think there's a tremendous number of people suffering for what are, mechanistically, simple reasons. Perhaps a genetic mutation causing their nerves to be more sensitive than they should be, by 50%, just enough to cause allodynia. Or something slightly off causing their sleep to be disrupted which throws off other systems.

I have a theory that a lot of chronic disease we see is a downstream result of other processes going just slightly wrong. I have migraines -- I don't think they came out of nowhere. I think they were borne of an overstressed CNS caused by chronic maladaptive anxiety and somatization. 

I don't think it's a coincidence that I have all sorts of other problems -- other chronic pain issues, fatigue, anxiety, depression, constant muscular injuries, ADHD, etc. I strongly suspect there is a common central source.

Somewhere down the line I think we will look back at these days of medicine and think, wow that was barbaric. All this person needed was to correct the undersensitivty of their postsynaptic 5htp2a receptors, instead, we gave them gabapentin for 10 years.</div>

I did create 71 images (including the original photo)

Observations:

1. All detail must be eliminated from the background

2. Sepia filter

-The odds of someone and a lawyer connected to them dying in seperate plane crashes 2 months apart without foul play are near 0

Mr. Doran was a 9/11 victims lawyer who volunteered his services to help the victims of the 9/11 attacks receive compensation. He was also working with the families who rejected the offer of the compensation fund, the same exact fund eckert rejected

Also one of her statements was “my silence can’t be bought”</div>
